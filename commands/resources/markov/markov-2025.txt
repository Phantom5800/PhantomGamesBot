Yo haven't seen you since last year Kappa
check the write up I just did in #general
thankfully my N64 is working now
yeah i seen i was gonna say try cleaning it could be overheating
Ive never opened one before but could be worth a shot
hello. happy new year, best of luck on the run
Hii Phantom, happy new year and good luck phanto274Wave phanto274GL
it was good had some crazy luck on genshin so very happy
reset now before you go any further
so will this be glitchless or a normal speedrun?
So in Kazooie I just entered mad monster mansion, 100%'d all the previous worlds and IGT says 4:20 LUL
i was thinking my pc broke
guess i dont have to clip it
Happy New yr all! and yay a nice choice
did link die as a wolf permanently?
or is he now a growlithe?
awsm gambas and predictions will no longer have an effect on me.
It takes so long to look through the emote list to pick what one I want
maybe I'll just do this one
I finally dont feel like death
Shit's still draining so still mildly yucky feeling but I'm mostly over this cold
Starting soon more like starting right now
It looks good honestly if you hadn't said grape reduction I absolutely would said to call it that
If you said ayg reduction I would've produced tears
I block that part out of my mind
I'm flying back to Houston today before the polar vortex wipes me off the map
Teaching my niece in law to pronounce the days of the week
Indiana for a travel nurse contract
This was the week I would've gone to AGDQ but I decided to save money 🥲
I pronounce my days of the week by saying dee instead of day at the end
I'd fall off that loft at least once curtis8AAAAA
Very smooth turn Phan...perfect as always
I only slept 4 hours after work before having to get ready for this flight
I got a text box for you right here PantsGrab
homie wtf is a "grape demi reduction" that ain't even real u made that up ICANT also yo gl
curtis8F oh right I knew that
I swear it's there just to stop people
You almost checked for a hint
goats can eat almost anything. including time.
My ears are open amongst other things
In my I need to touch grass
I take back what I said about being smooth lolz
also that's a good quote too lmfao
I found a streamer playing tp on crowd control
Make sure you show her your rod
When you've played rando too long
I'm legally changing my name to Dragon Ball Z.
This isn't even my final form
Ok that's enough bad jokes from me
Ugh hate talking to the cuccoos too
Tail slap them twice and they're ded
At least it gets some tail for its efforts
Damn, sorry, I promised to stop the bad jokes XD
I try to turn off sass here and it just comes out naturally
Gotta love the helpful monkeys in Zelda games
he looks like a guy who saw the moon fall :P
He looks like the best Link
I wanted that phrase tattooed on me
I hope Low Transforms isn't 'normal' now LuL I can't keep doing that
you just gotta not spank him so hard
do you know you can skip the "we're gonna fight ook" cutscene?
well not by pressing start, by rolling around to the right instead of using the monkey chain to get to the central platform
since it's not a direct path back to the central platform
yay the game didn't shatter under the massive beating of a monkey this time
Is it just on my end, or did audio just get really distorted
Every time I open your chat twitch makes my whole chat purple and says please knock
I will resist the green goblin mask this time though
I cancel it myself after a few seconds just to remove your popup lol
rhone are you going to join the glitchless mm race
I kinda just run and throw in that room
strange, must have been the browser. Tried a different browser and sounds fine now.
You dont have to do this, you can swim and jump to the chest from behind
am I stupid for doing cave of ordeals 3 times to fill all my bottles with fairy tears and also doing roll goll 64 times
no, sounds like you were bored though LOL
I wanted a true 100% file
Its better than a true 100% skyward sword file :)
Imagine how long Tender Hearted took to make that.
In Skyward Sword there are tons of collectible things, and Tender Hearted took the time to fill them up for a 100% file.
i beat it once on wii game is bad
game is bad, too may cutscenes and I hate Fi
Ookless takes a while to  learn. DF has a good file.
However if you do ookless, you can throw his first bombling to make him appear faster.
nice one pokemon colloseum rando sounds fun
i just play rayman 3 i know wanna chill and enjoi yur stream
Rolling to Eldin is by far the best part of the run, I hope you enjoyed it
I played it 20 years ago and had nightmares as a child XD because of the game
when i see rayman i see supert ed from n64
i say as a child i hat my fun with super ed beatet ons
I was only able to save the game using a rumble pack, I never finished the game (couldn't save), I bought a rumble pack to save it, what do I do? I play through it without saving
i wish you good luck wreslting the naked old man
it's what's happening off screen during a shot zoomed in on Link's face during the cs before KB1
its always funny to slap him odd
my strat is the opposite, i do the issac strat, spam a until win
so i decided to bite the (higher fees) bullet and order Cane's through doordash since i hadn't had it yet lol
all you had to do was RIDE THE DAMN HORSE, LINK
insert tulio and miguel "GET. ON. THE HORSE."
I fall asleep for 2 minutes evo17Flip
honestly, i get the cane's hype
lmao 38 doesnt have many jokes about it no
the breading is the right amount, cooked well, the chicken is flavorful, and the sauce is good
oh we've had one but they aren't dashpass eligible
so i haven't tried it yet
@Mirby_Studios i read this as breeding and was very very confused
the strat is always sidestep -> B -> A
if he sidesteps while you do, still press B
his rng is more heavily weighted than Bo's, so it's always your best bet to do that
there's still some rng but in theory he is not as bad as bo
okay that cutscene is skippable with start
tp seems to be very good at documenting their stuff
erin and I try a lot with prime 2
cause some people like to upload unlisted videos and don't share stuff unless someone asks
the best speedrun documentation is the SRC guide on how to start running crash bash 200%
I upload a lot of unlisted stuff but it's all linked on zsr, as is my playlist
nah I'm doing some MM now
I don't think you can make that RTA
You can but it only saves 1f, according to Ekke I think
I think Simi has done it
I should check my english and jp disc loads to figure out what I should use for glitchless
jp is 2 seconds faster I think from text
some of the text boxes are slower but some are faster. I still think german is the fastest
I never thought to come back out via mini boss
i mean you're in a dungeon so close enough for me
I did not know you could shoot this down from here
Make sure not to die to this boss. I hear he's really difficult
look it's me when i step outside in july here
damn, hitting it from the back\
it's a cool strat. only worth it with ordon sword though
i woke up at 5 pm and decided to skip my meds today and just go to bed early
tbf i also went to bed at like, noon
i co9uldn sleep, and then at like 9:30 i cut my hair and dyed it pink
see i WANTED to wak eup at 2, but i turned off the alarm and passed back out
butyeah i take adderall so it keeps me up, so im skipping it today so i can go to bed earlier and not like, 5am
ya know i never knew you could kill those guys as human for several years until i saw speedruns as a child
idk why did you press A on the horse if you didn't wanna get on? What
i mena yeah, i got the game in 2007, i was 10
but yeah was like, late teen like 17 or so when i started waatching Kejs, first one i saw do a tp run back when he was WR and was astonished you could do it as huma lmao
FeelsStrongMan kejs had record when I started running
now im out here like, yes this owl statue chest is attainable sphere 1
yeah kejs was the first tp runner i was watching  before beest
i could ever do any% or really any speedrun
simply bcuz idk how livesplit works
it took me several hours just to get a simple timer when i started doing rando races lmao
the first speedrun I took seriously was like a 4 hour run for me at the time
but i have done 16 star for fun before
16 star is a great speedrun for funzies
I could never take sm64 seriously
I find it hard to motivate myself to learn things when I want to learn things
ill brb going to pick up food
the twilights are more fun than you'd think with practice
-15C or 5F it was awful
Oh you're going all the way in
It's Lakebed... a zelda water temple. It's gonna have cutscenes since it's so scenic
Man helms don't like you lolz
yep same thing happened to me with a metroid prime 2 run
some random guy copyright claims the lower torvus bog theme
its so annoying getting those claims removed, much easier on twitch to get it removed
like these people sample these songs in their music which is fine but they go and coptright it illegally
yeah itss ridiculous, it happens alot to me for the fishing hole theme
what rando does to your brain
i was gonna say that sound slike alie
I have a weird reason for it
i keep claw pn x bcuz bow goes on y
when me and my brother were kids he liked hookshot/clawshot on the Y button so I decided to be different have it on X
and that preference has stuck with me forever
bow goes on y bcuz id usually put iron boots there, but w quick transformm you cant equip/unequip boots on y while olding chains in gm
idk, i was never told otherwise it just became habit
my preferences are Claw X, bow Y, Boomerang Y. everything just goes where those two aren't
yeah bcuz i did bring it up to them, and then was never updated it lmao
claw has highest priority to me
most people are Claw Y Rang X
stick goes anywhere bro come on
lmao all i know is ocarina is c down
bombs also go on any c-button
but hook goes on c-right if you're using gamecube (X)
Ok I literally just tabbed back in to type and twitch told me to knock again
Anyways I just beat ys 8
I was really not caring for the story for the first while of that game but that 2nd half really pulled me in
Also multiple chars when you max out their bond were like "Adol, there's some people out there who are gonna fucking get you" so I assume that's the next game
I did pretty much everything except like a couple raid thingies I didn't feel like doing and the 1 extra thing for postgame
I 100%'d the map and treasures and all that
Actual fun game to explore in
Woke up from a seizure... I'm dizzy and have a headache
I will... decided to watch your stream until I fall back to sleep
Damn ys 9 is only 8gb
Do you know the quick knock down
Its basically just hug the wall, 5 slow rolls, walk a few steps then spinner
At least that's how I do it
yeah i can do it very rarely
its the fourth trill, i had to watch a video pointing it out bcuz its hardto describe w words
I see you're streaming on YT now too
using spinner to leave is fast btw. for some reason in stallord's room spinner has like 3 billion speed
That's actually how I noticed you were live tonight lol
I saw you live before in YouTube
i saw you live when discord told me KEKW
i saw you were live when i st down at my pc and opened twitch lol
if I like the game enough I remember it easily
ive done rando for so long i know where every chest in thje game is
do i know the vanilla contents??? absolutley not
I think I've memorized this game by now
I'm not sure if I know where every grotto or overworld chest is
i know where boss key chests are bcuz they are different looking lmao
I've never done randomizer for this game but i've 100%ed it like 5 times this year
its very fun if you know the game well
Gonna head to bed... this headache is killing me... phanto274GL with the game and have fun
im so exciting theyre working on entrance rando rn
I would probably just use the most common settings
yeah i'm spoiled by metroid prime 1/2 randomizer
and get shit out of logic
they have sliders for trick levels for each individual trick
so like they have beginner bomb jump tricks, expert bomb jump tricks
to be fair, tp rando is literally only on ver5sion 1.2
oot and mm and combo ootmm has tr5ick lists
so I would probably have to do glitchless rando because I know how to do zora armor skip/ljas and stuff but I don't know epona oob stuff
no but i mean they've only put out two major updates
I don't care too much about cosmetic stuff
all the storage stuff is kinda dumb tbh
just because you have to walk across the map to do storage
wolf fur colour change coming soon
i have their uh, github to do list bookmarked i check it like once a week lmao
maybe I'll change link's tunic color but every hud color I see someone have is so bad so it makes me not wanna change it
@Draconif i always hit rando everything unti i  see tunic colors i like, when i just match them, all up
so it's either fully glitched logic, fully glitchless logic, or no logic
no logic is really fun if you know the game really well
but yeah theyre adding freestanding, entrance rando, random starting, and portals in item pool
it didnt use to be like that
but you used to just have to go to an area at least once to get the portal
i think portals in item pool w entrance rando is gonna go hard, especially if weget the option in the future of portals go to differnt areas, but i can see that being a pain
I know rando has quick transform
rando has q transform, fast climb and fast iron boots
ive never used iron boots on sand
but i'm ok with HD qol
me wondering why you don't have spinner and bombs equipped just to remember this is the western ruleset
wait really? so i dont just suck w poe 1 skip, its the rando thnats the problem lmao
i always use clawshot anything so poe 1 skip is always free phanto274Smile
clawshot anything? is that an option??
its an option in mm rando so i just enable it for tp rando too lol
i wonder if tp bingomizer is any good
ive only done 2 bingo raaces
i never knew how to make it super consistent though
I think the aim is too high
i think you're too far right
thepri67Love dylanjLove tippiALove ghunzoLove tghLove marcoLove AmbessaLove popesLove
just carve these skull kids into arrows
i dont know of any arrow drops in lost woods
... youre supposed to use arrows? i would just do this as dog
well this are id use bomb arrows, but i think the skulls may have arrowsd here?
i think you can also hit him w claw im not sure
when you enter tot the left pot by the switch has arrows
I didn't know that one had guaranteed arrows
most pots in tot have arrows i find, its er5y helpful
press B right after you press A
this one you have to let link swing forward more
it's more precise than the other one
it's based on where the camera was in the cutscene, so you had to hold up
that bad for a run this long
any crash in a good run is annoying
only way i know quick money is that lmao
i hate that you cant warp thjere its so annoying
yeah all of them take a while. the only one that could maybe be good is the one at lake hylia bridge
and even the puppets drop like a singular arrow
I mean mm runs typically were dead to bad drops for bombs
it doesn't anymore, but it used to
i gotta go to bed, gl on rest of run
why does that dragon have a sword and shield?
Yeah, but not nearly as well
There's an arrow chest in the next room, but you probably won't go that way
It's in this room, on the ledge you're walking past now
That might actually be the optimal route for glitchless, it's been a while
minus 11. but this is rly bad. fatpidTHONK
now you have to put in the time
We could all use a cuppy of milkers
@buff00n u know good and well what i meant
Thank god I don't run this game
I wouldn't stand how long it is
Regardless, 4+ hours is something I couldn't do
Idk shit about glitchless, but I do know tpgz is your lover for this game KEKW
Can you even do it with REL?
That's the best unfortunate shit I've seen in this game in 5 years
What makes me wonder is if there's a void plane, just because I'm that curious at fucking nothing
I have mac and cheese and chicken tendies to make for later
you know which, no need to say
fireman tweking got me feeling different
this music sounds like its from the oracle games
i started my blind vaniila tooie playthru
almost about to leave whitchy world
why dont you mod the exe1 title screen on exe6
just say its the japanese version of bn1
keiz speedrun is such a call back
even you dont intend to RNG manip, simply selecting continue from the title screen is still defined as RNG manip hence why we run single segment
its only that way for 1-3 btw
4-6 capcom stepped their game up
next time make bn1 a longer ETA LUL
redo the route, add ghost navi drops and dont do reddit skip LUL
incentive to NOT DO reddit skip KEKW
ad 10 if you know the comps
I thought you didnt know life virus skip lol
also if you fail it puts you back to post magicman fight
im 20 jiggies into tooie now
btw i got confirmation my X7 shipped, how long should it take? like 30 days?
im liking my new headphones, but I knew I would. Just went from mx40 to mx50
my old pair is fine, just the headband leather is peeling very bad
I can get a zip on cover for that tho
how you were in my recommend how are the speedruns going
I find it funny that everyone in colo cord including the person who originally made the program is like yea this program is very outdated in the programming language it uses lmao
I thought c++ was good what happened AAAA
I always hated hooking up gui to backend
At least I can easily edit the sheet ratJAMMIN
I don't think any of my college friends have gotten hacked lmfao
Smart engineers at a dumbass uni
meowdy Phantom, hope the practice is going well! phanto274GL
Oh fuck it was Supernova lmao
I called Supernova soft for not blocking anyone yet KEKW
Is this a spreadsheet for mega man
Okay I was wondering what the dots were AINTNOWAY
I dunno I saw a second place on there monadoGiggle
great to hear, if you pb I'll shove an entire carrot up my ass
I know you told me, but you never know bro KEKW
as an I guess former oot runner those two emotes fit so well
you see i just told me friend to swipe for a gacha character KEKW
Just get lucky it's a skill issue
we HolidayCookie HolidayCookie cooked HolidayCookie HolidayCookie this 1st hr.
oh I don't want the carrot
even when Higsby's not manning the counter, he's still making money
" gonna storm a terrorist base, I'll be back before dinner " - Lan, probably
GG to goodness late for getting my snack
phanto274GG on the runs, better luck next time!
aww someone beat me to first
hmmm i think twitch is messing up for me. it says continue subs on both of them and no stars or info. just says try again later. and this is after reloading
so if you have a free moment,  can you inform us what the game is about :)
well the story i mean. I'm only used to the megaman x series, as well as the OG megaman 1-10
i know nothing of the battle network
basically instead of dr light making robot children, he had a family. this is his family. wily is still a spiteful jerk.
well... at least all the character portraits look like its out of a horror movie
@Mirby_Studios thanks for the explanation. so next question following up with your statement: is Dr. Light young and having kids or is he building his "family"
yeah you play as his grandson in this
gotcha gotcha. so basically you're pretty much his living legacy that goes into computers and getting rid of virus's. and the damn doc's dead
it's also that instead of robotics, the world focused on network technology, that's the biggest difference
i know this will sound stupid, but whats the games version of "network technology"   is it basically everything is a smart device?
sounds close to what we are now a days
so they are hacking our smart devices huh? I'll keep a closer eye on my thermostat just in case
now does this game have the whole level up system or do you buy your specs/progression stuff
in this one you buy the PowerUPs to increase your stats
nice, so it sounds like you don't have to do unnecessary grinding
later games in the series swap that out mostly aside from the HP increases for a heavier customization system where you can have more specific builds and such
hey phantom, gl on the run
Its a shame that internet 8 said no
escape chips not cooperating is such a pain
so story wise, the boy you play on the overworld is the grandson, and the character inside the machines is megaman? or does he have a different name
with 4 comps to run through its really hard to get escape chips all the time. Thank goodness for R button strats
I blessed the run and it paid off
the overworld character is named Lan, he's the grandson, his digital AI assistant is MegaMan
lol megaman is the new siri
*gasp* so apple stole the idea from capcom
i smell a lawsuit for megasiri
AI have got faces like navis
dude could you imagine hackers getting into your TV and playing baby shark on loop for hours on end?
before we know it chatGPT will have a face
hey as long as the face is kat dennings i'm good with it lol
they aren't even hard to beat either. Just hp sponges
now when you use the chips, do they go away permanently?
you are correct about their hp
@Shadowcire thats how paper mario sticker star works LUL
@past88345 don't think i've ever heard that game
i just know PM 64, TTYD, and only heard of the origami one
where you can turn into a paper plane and stuff like that
its the 3ds paper mario game that had a lost trailer up on youtube recently for fans to see
whenever i remember i'll have to look it up
the trailer is very different to how the final game was
the heavy reliance on stickers was already in place, and it's hard to see what unique purpose the partners served, and as such may be another reason they were cut
oh they cut out partners in future paper marios?
partners haven't been as much of a thing since super paper mario i'd say. you had the pixls sure but they were more... ability helpers than true partners
so really the only 2 games with partners were the first 2
The environments looked cooler in the trailer and mole king boss would been cool to fight
thats like making super mario RPG without a team
it's a mario RPG without a team you get so
but i mean... red apples are better than green :D
honestly with the reception to the TTYD remake i think future paper marios will be more RPGs
instead of the adventure games they were turning into
cause super had very light RPG elements already, and with sticker star and color splash those were just adventure games with even lighter RPG elements
sounds like they butchered it to make it different for "reasons"
their vision for it wasn't an RPG anymore
hoping paper mario returns to its RPG form and does creative things with the formula
and thats a evil vision lol
Indie devs have made some interesting paper mario inspired games
@past88345 open world papermario where you traverse books as "dungeons"
bug fables especially shows the potential modern paper mario has
but yeah i do know one reason for stepping away from storylines isn't even them. japanese club nintendo members shortly after super paper mario dropped (which has a heavy reliance on story) responded to a player survey with how they did not like the story at all
i swear that bot is a fever dream come to life
so like it's not even the devs entirely to blame
they got feedback from a set of fans who could take the survey and they went with that
must've been terrible to switch genres
that wasn't even to them tho lol, that was about galaxy. his advice to them was about the characters and they went overboard
yeah you can't argue with mayamoto, he is the father of it
yeah he hated the version he played, which was the version in the trailer that dropped recently
and they... didn't change much lmao
which says a lot cause he's clarified his story comment recently saying he focuses on gameplay first and foremost
so if he hates the gameplay of something, especially something mario, you fucked up lmao
like he doesn't HATE story, he just puts its importance in game design behind the gameplay. which like, fair
story is important but if the game plays like dogshit nobody's gonna play it long enough to care about any story
true, not every game has the buster max option LUL
speaking on that, i enjoy games that are 8bit with great stories and gameplay, graphics don't mean sh*t if everything is executed poorly
yeah. plus the advice he gave to intsys about "try using only existing mario characters" was just advice and people think it was a corporate mandate they had no choice but to follow. an d like no, it was a tip they could choose to ignore. they did the opposite
so devs were just being bullheaded for no reason
big shame because original characters would have made sticker star feel less lonely
true. but they were being bullheaded that's undeniable lol
intsys in recent years has said they have basically full creative control over paper mario tho and have had that so
The funny thing is paper jam having no original characters was more of budget constraints. So alphadream restricted themselves like intelligent systems
with paper jam you could tell the writers wanted to do more with it
paper jam still has fantastic gameplay at least
the fear of lacking rng chips
its so funny how protoman flinches to a charged buster shot
hopefully you don't have to fight extra bosses
just in case anyone was asleep
also that legit got my anxiety up to maximum so thanks
only 2 months from 4 years
then I gotta stop cause that's too many
I won't say anything about my ass
And gl and I'll see you after I shower
Motherfucker you wanted a Pic of me with the carrot up my ass
Hey Phantom! Hope you are doing well phanto274Jam
That flareon and fuecoco are coolness let me guess u got them at best buy?
12345? That's the password on my luggage!
have a good night my dude
god you beat me to 1st again
I've got a MAD craving for a chicken sammich for some reason
chik fil a sounds super good right now
MegaMan X music for MegaMan.EXE, I'm in favor of it
17% of your viewers have degenerate issues
@SwiftPichu_ what's the half-life on a viewer?
I had to watch that clip you shared twice to realize the run wasn’t dead lmao
how many viewers will there be left in two years?
@En_Passant 3 and half a snickers bar
Unironically for a viewer they usually are around for like, 3 year or so
both. and it being big and veiny on top
Can I tongue play with both of them?
i'd be sad if you didn't
At least this tutorial is fast
just like the midget stuff i watch
why not? i have a judgement kink
Gives me even more of a reason to do so
We'll just dm each other it's fine
that almost sounded like another Shadow quote
@SwiftPichu_ i feel left out :(
Don't tell me it's a rip from duel links
Which one is it because I never knew there was a game with VA
Oh the one game who never made it to Mexico
I got so pissed because I really wanted to play that game KEKW
All we got was falsebound kingdom and duelists of the roses
Nah, my ps2 was set to English once I realized ratchet was in Spaniard Spanish
Yugioh voice line is so good at at those pulls
then i asked about 687354 questions about it
Axl talks abt it but I have no idea how this game works at all
it was explained to me like this: the draw system is like having a deck of 30 cards, and you can buy them or win them off battles
the bar at the top during battle is when you can select more cards, or as this game puts it, chips, and use those during battle
and what phantom just explained i didn't know about lol (minus the tied up teacher, i have plenty of those in my closet)
and the ones phantom really, really wants is the chips that has a person running. those are battle escapes
I am watching I'm just also getting my nails done ATM can't talk lol
@PeachedPocky do I? this game is fucking ass
idk just battle Network in general idk which one this is
how was the the rest of that attempt?
is it just me or is there a shitton more encounters this run?
RNG is a fickle mistress, Shadow
well i am home and gotta set up for my own stream but i will be dropping a lurk!
Yes in time. How are things?
Of course always pray to RNGesus for good runs
You keep doing this run, I'll go play with a rubber band
Somehow I pronounced gutsman as gust man
Anyways BRB gonna eat gutsmans ass
yo phantom hope you're doing well swifWave
I could not get their chip ever
I don't think I ever know the one to get it from x_x
Ah, that's where I already faught them, but I guess I never managed to double delete
I tried to 100% but internet netnavi fights was awful
S ranking and not getting the V3 is brutal
Ninja Gaiden voice: "God can't help you now"
Good evening and good luck on the run(s)
let it be known i know like nothing about these games let alone whatever this is swifSip
same can be said for a lot of what i watch i come to vibe and the games are a nice bonus lmao swifLurk
network is my fave megamanned speedrun maybe the x games are ahead of it.
bn3 is my fave bc all top 10 runs on leaerboard have dif elements regardless of dumb custom style
i guess im thinking of megaquints youtube races
Whats ur take on megaman and bass?
I find the 8 robot masters the best and angled powered up weapons
Very excited for this run bbirbHeadDesk
Have u setup the scenes and other stuff btw? Im curious if u did it since its required
Would it be worth save scumming those?
went to the gym and just got back, how are runs going?
sucks to be at the mercy of RNG like that
if it’s half as hard as that doc you shared o can only imagine
are you for real you got a quil
This is epic so I get to hear voice as well.
he's the sub in case the other receptionist gets sick
neither did I but here we are
the second fight is the bare minimum right?}
oh, I just know that the colosseum you want hyper mode
I wonder what factors affect this shit
you say you wanted 2, there ya go chief
I know that's wes boo but I still see it as naruto
I mean not much you can do with the shades looking like a fucking headband
I think there's a pc at the beginning of the tower though
from this point on you want quil rxp right ?
my typing today is fucking terrible
I think just as you purify you get fucked up
Do you need blaze by a certain point?
Oh good then POG no damage
nothin like a good ole fashion bot fight
does eagun even have the pikachu in xd? it's been forever
one thing I will say though, xd is better casually for getting all the shadow mons
I wanna say yes it was like level 12 or 13
while here you're stuck with what you catch
I just wanna see if the mf evolves or run dead
The run shall not be dead not on me watch
Damn not even close was it?
what level does quilava need to evolve?
with the late hypers it makes sense
this run is just that punishing
omg that was actually so close
Way less hoping for the manip
I must conclude you for a Quilava
My brain did not do the brain thing
There was a day years ago I said I would start speed running Colosseum or XD
do you like the poison one
currently taking up space in marks hotel room
yo gl hitting frames today Phantom!
When agitated, this POKéMON protects itself by spraying poisonous sweat from its pores.
Good day and good luck on the runs! can you explain what you were doing just now?
oh nice after what you did last night? I gotta say seeing the behind the scenes made it way less daunting
I preordered Colosseum when it came out and got the jirachi bonus disk. A few years later, my brother helped me sell it on ebay for like $5
I saw the route had times in it but how precise is it in comparison to the starting?
I only ever rented Colosseum from blockbuster
for the waiting time, how precise to leave this battle?
ah okay that makes sense, just don’t want to over roll the rng
Do you have a manip for the quilava as well?
I'm dyeing my hair pink againne
Wait idk if you seen my pink hair at all
So you have to do all this setup, and then run is basically dead if you get a bad natured quilava?
Yes made it for a run.
it was. I’m just really tired today.
I even took a nap but I’m still tired
I think I’ll chill for the rest of the day and read or something
be sure to eat coin :)
Christ on psywave of all things
I had to take a nap today because i was up late thanks to rando LUL
quick, lets do World one in SMB1 swifDerp
Help me there is a lasagna in my ass
The sauce was the best part
You're doing it for memes at this point
I'm glad I missed the adamant regice I had in the last seed
what is this? good rng? in a colo run?
I was thinking the same thing lmao
is it actually working today? cause last time i remember it was being mean
There's also a consistent feel for it without the visual
I dont need to look at link to roll clip
i'm experimenting with something new: i have my taskbar at the top of my screen so i can see the clock at all times
And my 1f links in kof11 are easy just cause it's a fast rhythm that I just dont drop
I was looking at the sheet you sent me and the rng manips didnt make any sense to me lol
Apparently a lot of people do taskbar on the top
my desk fan normally blocks the bottom right of my main monitor and my water bottle does the same with my secondary
I pretty much always see it on the bottom
I always put mine down there
W11 actually prevents you from moving the taskbar entirely, but i saw a recommendation of a free app from someone i trust that lets me do that anyways lol
If you do side what's wrong with you
it's also because my work computer doesn't let me show seconds on the clock and at work i need to respond within one minute or time out every minute if the chatter is not responding for 3 minutes so i can be more accurate
i have it showing on W11, my work computer is actively blocking that option
Do a run with umbreon NOW
i mean i'll take a fry randomizer
some are garlic, some are cheese, some are chili, it's doable
a mix of waffle and curly, purely random
like of all things the bot could've said were randomized, fries are actually doable lmfao
ohey phantom you're in my area, lemme say hi :P
look as long as i'm living here i'm going to keep making the "i live in orre" jokes
are you adamant about this iceblueSmug
how many IV does it have though
how much phone number did this thing cry for KEKW
oh yeah phantom i beat digimon world data squad and i may have oneshot the final boss
it's really funny for lucemon satan mode to pop out and just get one tapped
look it's the game's fault. the optional bosses put up a fight. they take a beating. i just used the strat i used for those to actually beat them and... i guess i overbuffed lmao
as for why lucemon, game uses an original story with the characters from the show. well the DATS members from the show.
it deals with the seven demon lords
i'm sorry, this is dub. seven deadly digimon :P
but yeah one of those characters is voiced by roger craig smith and like 80% of his lines are delivered with what he would go on to use for his sonic voice
so i just started calling that character sonic
the battle system relies on your digimon's emotions and your available commands are based on how your digimon feels and while you can somewhat affect their mood with items or support commands its still somewhat random.
and choosing moves they don't want to do (represented by showing up the fewest times on screen) lowers your friendship with them
also annoying when you have evolution requirements that require a certain amount of command categories used and your digimon never wants to do that lol
there is one funny quirk with this system tho
so once you meet all requirements for an digivolution you have to trigger it in battle. so your tamers go digisoul charge
but marcus has to hit digimon to get that energy
and... if he KOs a digimon you skip your turn and have to come back around to try again lmao
there was legit one battle where both enemy digimon were at like barely any health so i had to wait til NEXT BATTLE to digivolve agumon cause marcus would've ko'd either of them
but yeah the game did not get good reviews. i guess the battle system didn't vibe with reviewers
but having beaten it... it's not bad. i've played much worse
i've played worse digimon even lmao
i mean i was doing hardcore RA so no save states lmao
but i did fast forward a lot
also the RA leaderboard for game time beaten relies on in-game time which... is sped up when you fast forward!
so i beat the game in 44 hours. which is not at all accurate
the nice thing is it only pops up on screen once you get to the final boss's phase 2
so it's not showing you game time the entire damn game
that's how i noticed it was based on the in-game timer cause the RA overlay also sped up when i fast forwarded lmao
at which point... feels like the leaderboard shouldn't be a thing if you are punished for placing in it for using a convenience feature
like i don't mind the "steps taken" leaderboard which, while silly, doesn't get messed up by fast forwarding
so it's a low bar for the quilava to clear then :P
look it can't possibly be worse than the LAST quilava. with two 1 IVs
i take full responsiblity when this quilava has 3 0s
i asked maddy to pick up paper towels at costco. did not expect them to come in just now with a fuckin' TWELVE PACK
is that like trying to get out of first cycle
So I take it you got the framer? PogBones
was joking with maddy about how you just said you hate spoink and maddy went "everyone hates spoink spoink is a terrible pokemon"
Well maybe you should tell Quil to get it together
are you duping great balls there?
Ok. I'm debating, do I order a pizza or go get sandwiches
Yeah. First turn item glitch. If you use an item during your first half of the turn, in the second half if you swap the locations, the game uses the index of the location to remove it from your inventory, but it uses the item you originally selected
Well. Quil. I said get it together. And you didn't.
well it's not WORSE than the last one
On the plusle side, Espeon is pretty good
Although I'm just gonna say it. A game full of double battles and a plusle with no early game minum to snag is a prosecutable crime
your doing the exact same thing as the last time I opened stream and idk what’s happening
I look forward to that. I saw you talk about it in the podcast
colo has started popping up in my youtube algorithm and I have no complaints
Ahh RIP apparently I forgot to use a coupon a couple weeks ago. Oh well
So get the framer or very specific frames late 4Head
hey - that means you can be off by 2 frames twice, if you're late - right? swifDerp
correction: "just be an even number of frames less then 6 late to the first and you gucci"
It's not that hard 4Head it's only impossible
Personally I think it'd be more fun to get it
You should try setting flowtimer to the pause button on livesplit btw (since pause starts livesplit)
Also I have seen 3 espy and I've also seen 4 espy
Please one more? I've been in the hospital almost all day
We all love one more PogChamp
Just how far you'd get then?
phanto274GL and HF on the runs
thank you for giving me something to watch while everyone else is at GDQ
btw I finished Banjo last night
Tooie is top tier, people sure do shit on iit alot
only thing I didnt like was Grunty taking me 2 hours
It's worse level design with everything taking 10x longer for no reason
canary mary is meh (second go around) but outside of that it's not AS bad as people insist it is like it's Rare's greatest sin
"no reason" it's a bigger game
I'm talking about incredibly long cutscenes for basic actions
I never cared for the first Banjo, so
Coney during his last event restream was joking about how it would be an incredible challenge to get a jiggy in tooie before a sonix set finished
The button mashing rubber banding to almost impossibility
yeah cloud cuckooland canary mary is awful i won't deny that
the longer missions was what I loved about it, wish modern mario had more fo that
like if SMO had interconnected worlds that played off each other id enjoy it way more
honestly i'd rather a sequel make the collectibles maybe a bit trickier to get than how half of them in kazooie were basically "walk up press two buttons get jiggy"
@Axl_SR What is, Jak and Daxter, for $500 Axl_SR
jak doesn't do that nearly as much as you think
You dont like 10fps in a game that moves slow?
wait that's eggman from the moviews
maybe one or two things but
It's such a good feature that pokemon brought it in for sv
Ima go sleep now though, developing headaches again ._.
good luck on the run and stuff
damn, they really left her in a bag out in the desert sun, dude's are lucky she's still alive
sure the frame is rough at times but thats the version AP is using so you just get used to it
holy pulled an Espeon already gl gl phanto274GL
as long as a world "feels" connection, I don't care if it really is or isn't
a consistent 30fps is fine, I'm not sure why it's considered "unplayable" all of the sudden
SV started to make me feel nauseous if you stayed in the lake areas too long
Modern games on console running like that is inexcusable
I never noticed it watching streams or it but I’m sure that’s something that doesn’t come across like that
i know someone that HATES when a game is capped at 30 cause it's apparently a disservice and no game should ever be that low
I fully believe it, it’s such a shame I hope they learned their lesson
Game Freak can NOT fuck up Black & White remakes, people will trash their HQs
as long as that studio is allowed to cook this time
cause ILCA can cook when allowed to, i've seen it
so i blame TPC for the issues in BDSP
@buff00n *Whomever makes the Black / White remakes can NOT fuck 'em up
I mean they sure did for gen 4 and that is more beloved
Gen 5 is a better base shell though
So it is harder to make it ass
I like Gen 5 mostly cuz TMs don't break
also it was announced today that an upcoming booster pack for the digimon card game is entirely Cyber Sleuth themed
DP are ass that game wasnt fun till plat
i can't wait for the option card where i blow out my opponent's ear drums with the title theme
i like some Gen5 mons but i'm thankful that BW2 eased up on the "unova only" idea
it’s true, the evolutions levels were stupid but I’m glad B2W2 opened the selection at least
the evolution levels were AWFUL for unova mons. like WHY do i have to wait to SIXTY FOUR
I’m iffy on Gen 5 too
i guess you find the mons unfezant
FUCK the fire starter, that thing ALWAYS gets fucked up whenever I use the bastard
look i'm forever mad that they changed the name of bouffalant's signature move
here it's the boring HEAD CHARGE
that sounds so much cooler and better lmao
in bw2 you can get a lv30 one with the overworld encounter
also i maintain that Emboar should've been named Boarbecue
Same route pretty much though lol
Pretty sure the volcarona is 35
reminder that braviary's JP name is WARRGLE
I started playing W2 a while ago just so I could try Braviary before 54 or whatever level it evolves
and that's just fun to say
What the fuck is that volcarona emote
that feels more like singles though
@Pallos7 you don't understand the culture
that' s what i was getting at lol
i just didn't want to type competitive
is it possible? we have a runnable quilava?!?
is mild bad for the purifying and hyper mode necessary?
The gen 5 walking meme wins
I just moved my setup and had an old monitor from work as my third and oh my god is it a game changer
I mean you stream enough lmao
that was the only reason I wanted one since Pape takes up a whole monitor and everything is scrunched
i don't have room for a third monitor. i could fit one on my desk and plug it into my computer but i don't have a spare outlet for it lmao
I need to replace this laptop, so it might be time to get a PC
if / when I do, I'm grabbing a 2nd monitor. 2nd monitor's OD
I had to get monitor arms to fit them all otherwise I’d have zero deskspace
Fair I have a decent size ikea desk or I’d have no hope at all
I have 2 27” and a 24” so that’s probably why you don’t struggle with 2
Time for twitch handle number 1 Moltres fan to enter the chat
I don't feel like describing my setup, so I'll post a picture to Discord
Oh I thought the bot just said that for a sec
Axl gonna fly out the bot Pog
His brows and stache makes me think of bobobo
Oh shit I'm back in ad city
Shall observe it as thoroughly as possible
Did you have to get the party together to advance the RNG?
Okay that makes more sense and I’m assuming an everdrive
and it's specifically the moltres that advances the rng?
oh wait I’m not thinking right, I’m sure you can just use tool to import the team
not me thinking people are busting out their GameCube link cable
Phan that was actually legit question. Idk if someone will do something
giving you a lot of fast ones today
oh my god not the split
Operation get Phantom a good Espeon phanto274Ban
Holy no wonder Mild is so rare
oh my god you’re rolling for that just for the last fight that’s wild
with enough defense, do you ever survive that crit from your first run?
I doubt it considering base stats but maybe there are some rolls that live
Might be 65 if I remember the eeveelution numbers that are swapped around
Couple that with a middling base HP and you get Furret being scary
yeah the level is not in your favour either
How long do you consider waiting, like 4ish minutes?
And what's 5 and a half at this point?
do you have the gameboy cable for 4 moltres?
it would save a lot of time in the long run
But a lot of work to setup
Who doesn't love a fire flying type
I had to look it up, Oricorio
I think they're in S/V now too
I know they were definitely in Kitakami, the ghost ones
But i've never used in my life
You would have missed like 2 tries so far Sadge
This, resetting every time and hoping sounds horrendous
It feels like it would be around 10-12 in
jeez. I didn't realize it was that expensive
I wonder which ones aren't these days
No no, 39 is better than 50 YEP
damn, a hooker spit on me AND you're streaming on a Friday? Todays been fanstastic
That's not a hugely favourable range to kill either
That’s right that fight was horrendous
if you could get the flamethrower tm…
Or typhlosion didn’t learn it in the 50’s or 60’s
that’s fair it is a pokemon speedrun
that espeon is quite literally nice
so it’s not killing Duskull is what you’re saying lol
it just had to be better. didn't have the skill to do that
That would be a great idea
"Will this Quilava be runnable? No. No but in Spanish."
and for your espeon to not get ganked by a furret afterward
want me to make 1 real quick
one of my favorite series of games ever
I never thought but these must have almost max friendship to start off with too
Wow I actually got 10 Phantokens EZ
The Devil that Walks to a Gen 5 tune
Just because of heart gauge levels?
wait was that THE GUY we saw OUTSIDE
In the second game it's revealed it's actually his first day on the job haha!
It's in one of the news stories "it's revealed that his story of 40 long years of cranking gears is a lie and it's closer to 39."  And since the 2nd story is set like a year or so after the first one haha.
Yo, the first time I've seen a Colosseum speedrun in a Colosseum
Because they wanted to be a special kind of speedrunner
I can only imagine someone losing a run to a 1/256
the odds of something happening might be small but it will happen
Pokemon is one of those games where it happens 100% of the time 1/256th of the time
Like when you are born there is an RNG role, and if it lands on 256, your pokemon will always leave hyper mode
Your killing my cousin!  He owes me fish...
Wow, you're such a good trainer! Let me escort you into our guarded base without considering who you are!
But that's why it has speed boost D:
I love how your pokemon don't listen to you, except to attack, UNLESS they are GMO'd to not feel emotion are hyper... That makes sense
They could have put any other text there
How hard would it have been to say "Espeon is already paying attention to you"
See. Like that. It's meaningless to use that item here. Not the item didn't work, just it doesn't mean anything in this situation. Game devs are aware of that concept
But calling your Pokemon can't just simply be meaningless, no Espeon have to SPECIFICALLY just not be listening to its trainer except for battle commands
Ok I actually love this game it's just one of those details that I'm like "Someone specifically wrote that and it doesn't make sense"
hi phantom i have a question for you
you sent us like.. 5 boxes of floss
there is so much of it
It has your name on it from amazon
Your teeth are gonna be SO clean
I am deadass serious, it has your name on it, and there's so many of it
ok I type that and twitch once again asks me to knock
I looked at it and I was like.. "phantom doesn't live here anymore..." *opens it* "Huh this is kinda heavy... what is- oh that's floss.. oh god.. why is there so much of it??"
Like.. if it was 1 maybe 2.. I'd understand
is it always oblivious? or is it thick fat? I’m assuming abilities randomize between the 2?
I wish I saw the damage range
ooo a run instead of  watching fire types :P
the model looks weird to me
It has an edgy Galarian form
i dont not like them just the modle
@darkapplequeen We needed to snag the Meditite
Otherwise in terms of Pokemon we will have no pokemon
And if we have no pokemon in a Pokemon game, you're just a loser
And we didn't Speedrun to be a loser
is it back to stare at fire types time again
AND we get the added side benefit of rescuing a GMO pokemon from an evil person and an extra body
Imagine missing when lunging yourself knee first
it sure isn’t Gen 1 crit rate
I swear someone at Pokemon put some secret line of code that checks if "good" rng would actually be bad in the situation, and if so, guarantees it
i think flareeon on background needs to be closer for good luck
would this manip be different if performed on a gamecube instead of a wii?
Best platform to be GBA games: GC. Best platform to play GC games: Wii. Best platform to play Wii games: Wii U. Best platform to play Wii U games: The DX/Deluxe re-release for the Switch Kappa
You know what they need to do
They need to make a PokeBall where the red/white is sideways and call it the Miror Ball
It's a special ball that has an extra catchrate for lotad and ludicolo
Or maybe like any "dancing" pokemon
Should be the one around 14x
Unless there's multiple around that, then gl lol
@Swiftalu oh look who it is
holy snot this new rng program has HUGE font
Did Juan finish approving updates or
Nah I can wait it's chill
Yo it's a very fast alu swifWave
Banjo kept me up at nights, I ccan finally sleep now
I was hearing the voices in my sleep LUL
Just do both runs at the same time
honestly glitchless could be the wave for me, ive only done any% (very hard and time consuming)
did you do your BN event already?
It's like TP Glitched but without the glitches
You gotta attempt to connect with its heart
Wait why do we call it here?
Dude your mode is so hyper you don't even know
Oh hey you finally got a good espeon?
The espeon met all of the required stats on the postinf
A bad colosseum in the game dedicated to colosseums
The important thing is that we get the spoon this time
I, personally, forbid it with the power I invested in me
seems were on a run. Back from halftime my buckeyes are up.
has pape dropped in price? my local is selling it for $55. Never seen it that low
they have jet force gemini for 15, that surprises me
Dude you could revive someone with that revive
You really needed to heal D:
They don't need your modern medicine
Oh. I'm being informed apparently they do
It's about the principle of the matter
Seeking specific performance, not monetary gains
im slowly replacing my shittily hacked together UI with a better one on my speedrun timer
i did some speedruns with it tho, it does work
also im like 5 minutes away from bopping a pc runner on the hl2 leaderboards lol
it being harder means i have to be more careful and more precise
Miror is timeless never gets old
and then if i ever run on PC again i can use strats i came up with for xbox to make it really easy lol
Wait did your quil die again
I saw it died a couple of times in pyrite and was like oh no
But at least sheet will not assume ty if you don't evolve
People have done first fight no ty lol
Hey at least it wasn't crit sixeTada
Oh I saw, Zeke told me lmao
Was like "That's why I am scared to use confusuon"
"BALTOY was burned!" "BALTOY was hurt by its burn!" "BALTOY fainted!"
"BALTOY was burned!" "BALTOY used Cosmic Power!" "BALTOY's SP DEF and DEF rose!" "BALTOY was hurt by its burn!" "BALTOY fainted!"
Thanks Swift. I was having trouble keeping up
The defenses might be wrong but it might as well be 1 message with how fast they pop up
Wynaut at least isn't too bad of a lead
Dude that Geodude just got geo'd
I moved all shifted info + that in there so you don't need to scroll up and down
(I hated scrolling up and down)
Great start for sure but its tied going into 4th.
"Oh fuck does Venus target my dumb fuck fire fish lemme just SCROLL ALL THE WAY UP TO FIND OUT then scroll ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN"
your brain is too big phantom
Also it's ok your not the first person to not know about using the miscinfo tab lmfao
I don't really have a better way to call it and already noted it down at the top about the change
Sorry, I didn't read what Swift said, can someone TTS?
So you want me to tts you say waynerHmm
Cheer100 shadow: Also it's ok your not the first person to not know about using the miscinfo tab lmfao I don't really have a better way to call it and already noted it down at the top about the change People just hate reading
I would have read it but I hate reading
he just went rrrrr he didnt get to am
think it had to be confusion ty kill shrew
Most of my notes now are the premium tts voices I'm so limited here >:(
I just got shadow and kkona so we get dying and screaming
I guess I can make shadow say foods
Cheer100 shadow: fettuccine alfredo (silence) cappuccino (silence) beef burritos (silence) creme brulee (silence) croissants (silence) Crème Fraîche Meringues (silence) cheese soufflé
YEP Shadow said all those completely correctly
i love how he says creme brulee
ok cool I didnt remember if this one was laughing or yelling
do you have these on some document you copy / paste from ?
this is one of my favorites lately
Cheer100 kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,,
it's a normal thing to type
I have this conversation almost every day
I forgot how long this one was oops
can't wait to see how the bot uses that
The bot hasn't pulled any of my tts to my knowledge yet
Why would people be trying to sleep when they can watch Colosseum?
it would use way more commas
all the kkonas use a billion , and ' to space it right
D: you just took the spoon away
Now how will Espeon eat ice cream?
Cheer169  eggman: you thought you could trick me with that fake emerald, didn't you? tails: so... how did you know it wasn't the real one? sonic: tails! eggman: because you just told me, fox boy!
I guess TTS Monster doesn't support eggman and tails voices sadge
They might just be premium ones
It's not too bad considering you heal right after this I guess
Venus is a planet, of course you lose to it
What do you think Rui does after this game?
I love this sequence. You find a key to use a key to steal a key
And you let two detainees escape
Instead of .. you know... Just finding the key
I love how she just gets on the TV to be like "Yo you didn't catch them yet :( Big sad okay bye"
My buckeyes are goin to the Natty baby!
We do like TM 17 :)
Gone are the days Espeon KO'd pokemon out of love for you
Just use the Pokemon go use moves until all of her pokemon faint. It works every time
Just curious is there a reason we do the full heal first?
And full health means no fainting, in some cases
That specific teddiursa is the teddiursa they made into a shadow in XD. New lore
Maybe if it sang better it wouldn't need to cry
It would be unoptimal to miss so he doesn't do it
no fire blast this run i suppose
You know. These villains are not very smart. If they installed mantraps in their elevators they'd have been far more successful at every venture
They should hire me as a consultant
D: Plusle? But Plusle is gonna get absolutely murdered
lol this is a fun exploit
Also, I like how in XD it's clear they renovated this lab and changed it to be more secure
But it's still the same structure
Also. That brings an interesting point. Who the hell is a construction contractor in this region?
whomever they are, they don't ask questions
"What's that? You want a giant pyramid laboratory base with a giant generator at the top that can be overvolted by pressing a button over and over?
Ohhh. I didn't even register the fact that you just took all the pokes out of your party
Like I give them a pass with Relagem tower. Since there's the casino cover business
And a giant colosseum which is tourism and entertainment
And like... Who built the deep colosseum and was like "Yes. Giant pit under a giant city in a ravine under the city where there's no sunlight. OSHA approved"
You know. I just had a cool idea for a game mechanic I want them to implement now
If you use a move that steals Keckleon's held item it should get an instant +10 boost to all stats
Drat the run had to end this way
That would have activated Blaze :)
Unfortunately it also can't use moves
Umbreon destined to be in the box forever
Ahh okay I see what you mean by the targeting now
When have I ever steered you wrong?
Raikou considered Quick Attack but didn't consider Strong Style
This now breaks my staying up time this yr.
We all need to stay up
Ok Ty it's all on you
I’m not streaming tonight I’m going to bed
damn come back and run o7
ima try n lurk snooze sleep so talk a lot ok mr strimmer?
Uhm I can't help but notice a high discrepancy
Who runs TP .. for fun?
What's up? Taking a break from math because something is wrong with my formula XD
That's like paying taxes for fun
It's better than me who is really tempted to try a 100% no hit run
So I'm gonna say I'm gonna lurk so I can work on my project but I probably won't actually work on it or actually lurk
for emerald I added type shuffle, so all fire poke would be rock for example
did you see how lopez attempts went?
cant wait to die to a ice trap and everyone o7 also KEKW
Paper Mario is where runners go to experience hell
yeah, that does rhyme well PrideLaugh
if it burns my ears, yeah ohheyi30Hehe
Fire does that too but it doesn't rhyme
extract the oil and take a bath in it
I played the Switch game when that came out
i played master duel like 3 days ago it was still shit KEKW
I stopped playing Pokemon TCG around the Unova sets
dont think i could get back into yugioh nowadays. looks too crazy compared to back then
I used to play a Serperior heal deck and then an elektross energy recovery deck
i am just so done with yugioh
YuGiOh isn't a game, it's an introductory competitive law class
It's all about who can summon Barrone the fastest and then win. Anything else isn't playing it's just goofing around
Yeah Yu-Gi-Oh right now is rather crazy with how the decks now are
Most decks is just half handtraps and then your engine of choice
I think we need to pull the Pokemon strategy. Do a one time ban of everything and then slowly reintroduce things so the game is reasonably paced again
Blue Eyes is set to get some new supports soon
I get it. They want tournaments to be quick, but two turn win or scoop isn't fun
But you don't get it! Their eyes were blue!!
idk what my fav deck is anymore
A link 1 and a few new tuners/synchro Ultimate Dragon and a XYZ
New Ultimate Dragon is flipped stats from ultimate dragon
Which allows Blue Eyes to run Crimson Dragon
Just got out the most difficult shower I've ever taken
D: that beast is so twilight
That targets something with a level on your field sends itself back to extra and then summons a dragon synchro from extra with the monster whose level you targeted
Yoooo let's go I love using the Crimson dragon for decks that never used the signer dragons ever
uh oh phantom is on that tp glitchless grind
And it counts as a synchro summon so it bypasses all the summon restrictions
And new Blue Eyes can summon both it's new synchro ultimate dragon and CD easily
Basically, you can get a free Quasar dragon which normally requires an accel synchro and has to be synchro'd but Crimson cheats it out as long as you can summon it and any other level 12
Which lets you put out another level 12 Dragón Synchro most often being either Cosmic Quasar or Stardust Sifr
It's not toxic because they used lead free paint
Dark Magician really needs that level of support
And because it returns to ED, you can just summon it again next turn assuming you haven't lost by then
Mostly just the metalmorph stuff that helps to bond both it and Flame Swordsman together
Dark Magician is just too easily interrupted with modern decks shitting out handtraps like Ash or Called by
Blue Eyes monster: "Once per turn, you can force your opponent to forfeit. This effect and it's activation cannot be negated". Red Eyes: "Once per duel; Increase this cards attack points by 1, then your opponent gains 10,000 life points"
Because handtraps are basically half the deck now
Ash, Droll, Infinite, Maxx C, etc.
Yeah Mulcharmy and Maxx C together is cancer
Because if you don't deck them out they will reload their deck
Because Mulcharmy will force your hand to return to max size while sending the rest of the cards back into the deck
At least Maxx C is limited to 2 in the OCG
I love when my opponent throws a maxx C right before I summon 3 trickstar lycrois
More or less Yu-Gi-Oh right now aims to prevent the other player from playing the game
Because they want tournaments to be quicker
And if you can FTK even bettee
Just take 6 prizes in a single attack
Could totally reach there...he just had to jump
me going to sleep   have fun and good lucky phantom
mark is going to give me our wii so ill be learning this run soon o7
i loved this game so much as a kid it was the first one i tried to play as fast as possible
time save for next run YEP
cant believe they made a whole game from that smash stage
I see a lot of gold
i will say i am learning more about the game
D: That was my favorite eldin bridge
@Zeliversal I hear you could get lucky in Hyrules version of the Ikea market, they make new ones regularly KappaPride
tippiLurk gl with the run tippiLove
these 2 bugs are quite literally positioned to be a pain in the neck
honestly? couldve just repositioned them - there's 2 wide fields
coulda put one by the owl statue as like a mental "ahaaaa!" once ya then get domrod
so as to encourage having seen them and such
like - ik HD cut some of them out, but cutting them out to me feels like the silliest of solutions when MQ OoT (even if in sections very awkwardly) showed slight repositionings as a solution
I never made it past the temple and the volcano
Forest temple / Death mountain ya mean ilsolaro? tippiTap
if I were to, from asthetic I'd give AG, GM and CitS in that order their slots in this, from gameplay tie-in to visuals it'd be AG, Snowpeak and CitS in that order
with Snowpeak taking the "this is hilariously dumn for a zelda game" spot
I get that and also the not inherently intuitive controls of certain things inside of it
but I do like how it behaves despite that
in repetition, 100% Snowpeak is the worst if you dont know jack about how to cheese some things
cus then you're on a very extended and exhausted railroad
not just the HP chest, that one I give a pass - I more mean the extended "I know this happens now, but round and round i go"
for all respective forced roundabouts you gotta take
like - it encourages thinking vastly out of the box to the point where you can accidentally break into the other spheres of "planned pathing"
these 2 bulblin up there are my biggest enemies btw
ever since I did the cheevos for this KEKW
She got her licenses from a inside a cereal box, give her a chance
aw man you skipped the cutscene where Link looks at Telma's tits twice oranLUL
silly question btw, phantom, derpy curiosity: what in videogames ya think takes up the most space? models, graphics, cutscene related things?
Also whatcha submitting for Speedtember this year? oranMonka
I would then be thinking of prerecorded cutscenes rather then ingame render - ingame render is code which is nothing for itself really
The longer the better tbh LOL
Oh this year slots will be 12 hour streams for 4-5 days, starting in the day and ending in the night.
But submissions are open till May so you got a lot of time
I would hazard a uninformed guess in times for glundo TP are in the 9 to 10hr range, yea? if you're zoomies?
oh huh, I thought its a wee bit more KEKW makes sense though
also makes me decently happy then given glundo is essentially zoomies casual hundo which I think I had like a 11hr file save at entrance to final fights like one time?
obv. thats not really anything to go by + not single sitting run and shit, but it rly does sound like glundo then is just "do that but very much so more planned and better"
hear me out: its not OoT water temple
the water dungeon is almost always the best dungeon in the game
except this one I think snowpeak is better
But I HAVE played this game
I hope you're well swift PrideLaugh
I need a guide every time for this one
@Jonxhas I am good hbu tippiSway
@Swiftalu for once more then just living, I actually feel not void KEKW
i need a guide whenever i do water, great bay, or lakebed, and any others i'm forgetting
AFTER YOU JUST SAID THAT IT WASN'T THAT BAD
GBT for me is sadly down to like 8 minutes now 😅
I played WAY too much MMRando
the most "ohhh" to me out of the 3 examples
I mean at least this isn't the sky temple shit
God that dungeon is ass too
top 3 dungeons in zelda series
That dungeon is the most frustrating one for me
1. snowpeak 2. temple of time 3. great bay temple
I love the design of it I just hate ball chain
GBT the temple is pretty cool, but GBT the experience is brought down by its bosses
I still like Snowpeak, you saw me putting it just behind AG for overall feels and vibes
its peak "haha lmao me silly" the dungeon
I do find it funny cause I recently replayed this game and it was such a breath of fresh air after skyward sword lmfao
WHY DID THEY MOVE BACKWARDS LOL
That's fair but I didn't mind that
you just reminded me of the pain when I was on 59/60 poes
I just waited and scrolled twitter or somethin
I literally SCOURED THE FUCKIN WORLD WAITING 10MIN EACH TIME FOR NIGHT
just do that during a run
temple of time and day/night? KEKW
literally like going to OGC in OoT
and I didnt think of it casually like ever that thats a thing which happens
hell, bulblin camp suffices for that too
"just go back there when ya need night time" never occured to me
I like spending 3 minutes going to arbiter's again instead of spending 4 minutes waiting for night
If you're phantom, then who's Ganon Sus
and fun fact that does NOT work on Wii 1.0
saving and quitting in Palace of Twilight also sets it to night time
@RubixTheSlime totally not me over here internally crying over memories of sitting there for over 4 real hours scouring hyrule for poes
Everyone here is the same person
It's the same for me as well
draconifs on my end is slightly lighter on the blue then mine
i can help the color problem
its the same overall range my non-trained eye would say, just a different shade of dark
That is copyright and theft and I will not stand for it
but can you sit for it?
there needs to be an enemy named bob
Yeah that's right I'm stealing colors too SirMad
@Draconif but there is, they are just called BOB-Omb
and they are in Mario games
one of the helemasaurs in lakebed named jake
but they sure as hell (in this one at least) love to be proactive
and that one cave where you deal with them loves to be painful KEKW
which honestly I dont recall if it has a heart piece or not, but I always went and did that one casually
fuck knows why if there isnt a heart piece there
not the worst enemy in zelda, the worst enemy is game controller from skyward sword
I think the freezard blocking the boss key in snowpeak should have a name
it kills me more than any other
eventually I will do glitchless again
in 2014 I did any% and a couple of all dungeons. in 2016 I did glitchless
and now for morpheel to take a swim at the ceiling
I think this wasnt even the worst
could have been one more random circle
imagine that cursed RNG where you get a 3minute cutscene for morpheel being unable to path to here KEKW
if you can manipulate RNG during the cutscene in any way, that makes me want to make a TAS of just Morpheel taking literal minutes
ya would truly wish that these 3rd party nonsense claims would not be okay ye
"who's ready for DMCA? this song will--" *cut to ad*
I suddenly feel bad for loving this song. dropBlind
you dont have to feel bad for that
time to see if a certain piece of bridge will again show us weird collision KEKW
i love those keese, or at least the way they taste
just give me the signal next run and i'll run ahead to take care of them
I mean - leathery texture has to be part of it
Link out here wanting to give up again up here KEKW
he nearly went under that bridge again!
"i forgor how my legs work"
I saw him think about sticking his head under it KEKW
and I BET the reason is silly simple
the bridges are as suggestive as the gates
the bridge isnt a single piece object model-wise
but each bridge segment is its own
as in "one bigger model, but separate pieces with lil gaps in the floor"
and then ya apply the wind jostling it about to the mix and you get "oh its not a platform during this frame"
either cus too high or too low or too weirdly angled during the cycle
ya should just model a piece of bridge like that more like say, a carpet or a cape really
you an apply textures to it to make it be seethrough where ya need it no prob
just - make it internally be more cape / carpet like
or maybe just like 3 total cuboids
more thinking one slim cuboid and then ya apply animation-cycle based deformations to it
which you can then line up with where you want the pieces of the wooden bridge (this instance) to be
actual cloth like physics I would assume could pose hassles in other places if you have that overall type of object elsewhere as like curtains as an example
"what if the player all of a sudden can walk up vertical pieces of cloth" and shit
*makes a game entirely out of cloth collisions and billboarded models*
You can time it pretty easily
Its like right before link jumps the gap
shame this is glitchless, this cutscene but human link is my favorite
there is but it takes 2 hours
i've seen it done before, idk where
and when would Low% get MS
low% gets master like like any% does
wolf link taming epona is a close second
Yeah that one is pretty hype
I'm excited for that when I run 100%
"human link pulls the master sword" only wins because you can fully see what's going on
actually, i think my favorite glitched cutscene of all is hitting the goron mask right as you return deku princess
I just love the theme of Snowpeak a lot
the effect is small and simple, but amusing. deku princess cranes her neck to look you in the face but the monkey just stares at your crotch
Exploring an abandoned military outpost is really cool
@RubixTheSlime belly button camera is strong
and funnier with goron then with zora I bet
You know I never thought about that, this is the only 3D Zelda like that too
i discovered it on accident and nearly died laughing
in Skyward sword your only bomb "drops" are from plucking bomb flowers
You get drops in Skyward Sword
musta forgotten those then, cus like - early in it feels so low in how often ya get them that my brain always just filled back up
and "later on" you really dont care much anymore cus you can have extra pouches if you want to
I do really like that feature in Skyward Sword though, plucking the bomb flowers and being able to store them later
or "shoot an arrow and be able to recover it if its in the wall"
how do you grow those things domestically, asking for a friend
which I dunno if skyward sword did that, but wanna say TP and Windwaker do both allow you that
Yo that happened to me the other day when my shield was on fire and I lost my shield due to it
Nah I didn't bother at that point
Since it technically wasn't really needed for anything
Its actually faster to roll up the stairs there
the stars aren't a slope so it doesn't kill your roll speed
Right before the key, you took the ramp
its also faster to do whatever TAS does
Yeah the Redead kill here actually surprised me when I saw Beest's strat for it
I knew I was a Tall Ass Stepbro
Don't worry Link, you can quickspin when you feel like it
I've found that rotating the stick slower than you think makes quickspinning more consistent
poe not be cringe challenge: impossible
invisible maze rooms not be cringe challenge: more impossible
link: "aight imma just put this spinner thing in my pocket"
not all the way in the corner though. just the general left wall
the spinner is def one of my fav tools
I've watched too much 100% I questioned why you ignored the poe
imagine if there was a random furry you could transform in front of
i for one would probably sleep better knowing the wolf that keeps running through town is actually just a human
i'd also be very jealous of the shapeshifting power
i want to be like yeto when i grow up
Yeto's basically the "eh whatever" person, lets you in his house and everything
who knew that bombs and jobs had so much in common
ball & chain makes block puzzles so much better
chillfos giving skyword sword game controller a run for its money
If you pb I will shove a turkey up my bunghole
I will not send proof you degenerate bastard
also who said anything about sending proof other then you Pichu? KEKW
did you hit the one spot where its a problem KEKW
Snowpeak heard you had a chill time so far
but the repairs are another 200 no? KEKW
Yeto and Yeta are into lock play
they keep a safety key in the chapel because you gotta unhorny to get to it
dont get trolled too hard by the game
does the golden cock taste like chicken, gold, or cock?
in other news, my medicine has worn off
I'm convinced most streamers are just torsos
must attend glubbers's run on GDQ
but also came to say i dressed up as link for halloween in 2015
if streamers are torsos to the viewers, what are viewers to the streamer
no way, i dressed up as link for a different even in 2016
would it force me to go live if you answered my knock one of these times
That'd be very funny if it did
i even sewed my own hat, and hennaed a triforce on my hand
i cant even chat so :(
i don't watch much gdq these days
Their chat is understandably sub only during the main events lol
aka only if i specifically plan it for someone i know
And that's been it so far lmao
i haven't seen any of this week lmao
I also really only watch it when its someone i know
i watched the no a button press SM64 run, that was cool
I watched the opening Pikmin run
I haven't watched gdq runs in a while
after going to one in 2019 it's just not the same
though maybe i'll watch back some things
i'd love to go some day, but money
I'll watch friends' runs but I won't go out of my way to watch it
or a game I really like
if mark and i didnt have to leave on thursday we were gonna be taking shots, so there was no watching runs
I always kill the lizalfos with bomb arrows on the first trip
makes the 2nd trip so much less annoying
you can do it pretty fast if you group them together
Seems the game was done in time for a stream. GLHF
why doesnt the statue roll when you roll. inaccurate movement, game literally unplayable
the statue also 1 shots the lizalfos
I think the statue should explode if link dies
where do i get a dominion rod that's bedroom compatible
also is there a submission rod
in this context it's a 1 shot. I think it does 10 hearts
the order is up, left, down right, up right, left, up left
but snowpeak is the coolest. peak gaming
AG can be a little dry sometimes
hey would you like a yellow rupee
that's TAS RNG manip levels of rupees
so that's where my order got held up at
i'll never order from Malo Express again
there's a guarnateed arrow drop in the alley by that one boko near the house
until you need rupee, then only arrow
ilia is supposed to be a major character yet restoring her memory is not mandatory
I think it's the other side
you do have to restore it
you do get the sky book though because you need it for the horse call
but that is in your inventory forever
just imagining how hated TP would be if you had to do this part without fast travel
it's much more enjoyable in glundo since you're doing stuff along the skybook
you even do cave of ordeals in the middle of it
Link: yo check out what i can do with my rod
we would need exactly 1 golden bug
what are the points of Ooccoos?
Did you pay your city taxes?
What is that little screen tho?
So which colosseum is your favorite?
i used to make Luke (my other brother) play this part for me because the hands made me anxious
Anyone here have a turkey they don't want?
i cant wait for my first run of this game to take 10hrs
Is this the best room in the game I see
@monado I'm gonna shove Patrick up your ass based on that comment
Look if I shove Mr krabs or SpongeBob it's just a guilty pleasure
I'll give you something to stare at Zeli, I promise I won't find it rude
Remind me to never learn glitchless if I get the itch
Glitchless is unironically a lot of fun
Can't do it if I don't run it
If I tell you its Pikmin I'd be lying to you
And I don't think you want that
Then I find it rude SirMad
I do have some good news for you Zeli
You can't fix this with an emote of cute Pikmin
what if I told you there's news of more Pikmin emotes being made
I'd say you tell me a lot of things and only some have been true
Most is a subset of some
Learning Palace isn't too bad tbf
If you learn stuff in Palace
You get it over with faster
I could also go drink some milk
It better have milk and not water
You could also play some Pikmin, but you won't
I'm gonna get my cereal (if you thought I was gonna say cum I'm judging you you degenerate pig Stare )
Holy shit, feels like you just had her
link open the door please can we not fight anymore
how the hell did that not hit
I swear to God and God knows, if you ask for proof about shoving a turkey up my ass I'll go up there and shove it up yours
what the Hell are y'all talking about in chat
Yeah well I didn't expect you'd actually be able to
Buff00n help me out of this I beg
They want Pic or didn't happen
GamesBot with the "Good luck" IMMEDIATELY after Phantom explains the bird going up someone's ass
Wouldn't be the first time a bot fucks me over
Or on this platform for that matter
I mean, you've threatened to fuck yourself over, so
Oh it's not even close to the shit I do say when I'm unhinged
i dreamt that i watched a documentary about a guy who had a fetish of shoving things up his colon
SwiftPichu_: Wouldn't be the first time a bot fucks
@stalkor if it was lasagna that was swiftpikachu_
chat, would YOU fuck a robot ?
Head is head, regardless of the source
we're on the same page, then
@buff00n yes but only in the communication port
do i get a spoon and eat chocolate icecream out of the container
i think its a Pennsylvania thing
I was attempting some Mario Party 9 solo mode for a sub 2:40 time
and errr, the run was absolutely apocalyptic
we're waiting to see if Swift has to stuff a turkey up their ass
I do not think I could’ve had a slower win on the last 3 boards
he really kicked that ball back at you
I genuinely wonder how mathematically improbable that run was
Get down from there Zelda monadoA
cant wait for the ER convo: “hi. whats the problem?” swift:”i stuffed a turkey” ER:”ok…then why are you here” Swift:”well….”
they must be cool ranch flavored
did you just say Cool Ranch is bad ?
I haven't even had cool ranch so no debate from me here
Yeah México doesn't have the same variety in snacks
No phantom tequila isn't a snack
But most of mexico's snacks is unironically insects
You're not fucking Ganondorf, Ganondorf is fucking you
I don't know the inside out of horseback dorf, most I know I hold up right KEKW
Too many swifts and swiftalu for me is the real swift
DARK LORD OBLITERATED BY BLUE TWINK
I'll send you a rotisserie Chicken
imagine being a red head and a twink.
I trust you'll figure out the rest
You cheap bitch at least give me a good turkey
it's $5 chicken, nice and juicy
You can watch glub when it's out from gdq
It was closer to 45, but yeah needed to squeeze the donos as usual
should have put on the iron boots
And why do I have a feeling ano has a time
Not as bad of a time, those used to he old hundo times
thank god. the fishing here is so non existent
Now if you turn over to oot, they have hylian loach rta
Yeah but this game is more serious than oot
They don't call extensions meme categories for nothing
I love staring at a rupee for like 13 hours
Yeah because ano is the only one I know who has done low transforms
low% you mean sit and stare at a rupie%
To be fair low% seems good for a subathon
Or other shit while it's going
Swiftike did a run a few years ago
doesnt low% have that 3 hour wait?
Ike did a low% run which was basically him losing at Mario kart
I've a feeling you'd like glundo more than this
i've already thought about doing glundo because it looks fun
i guess it would depend on whats faster
Low% in pape I feel there needs to be a warp or something
Did your bot just say yes but also no
so then what if you get bow.
I am, SO bloody tired, outta nowhere
I got someone doing yu gi oh if you want
did Link go to find a way home to his redhead gf ?
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your weekend
I will not shove anything up my ass
Yoy! phanto274Wave phanto274Smile  and phanto274GL trying for a phanto274Gold
I love this music so much musica23Mvgdance
Brings back a ton of memories
btw phantom what do you use for your on screen chat
I might give that a shot as well. not super happy with what I'm currently using for onscreen chat
do you just remember what stats you need for it to be a range?
or do you have a tool that tells you that?
that may be the last part of this run that is good
he's not slow, he's just living life at his own pace
that's why his hidden power is ice, because it doesn't move fast enough to heat up to any reasonable amount
and just like that I already have SGDQ week off
Oh I get it. Because the move is confusion
a modest quilava moseying his way through orre
wow a modest Quilava in this day and age? what a world
thansk for the hoothoot rand amish
I do what I can *tips hat*
Okay Quilava what are you doing
i mean i'd expect nothing lese with that speed IV
But you don't have FW so idk
terriermon should be on the bed peache114Angy
You know what, I take what I said back
Im good, I redeemed for someone to play prime 1 rando. I let them roll it and it was god awful LUL
Why do you catch the Meditite?
waow we have an espeon and quilava tracker so i don't even have to ask
The umbreon remains a mystery tho
Can’t crit it it’s in the ball EZ
I missed an if in there but I’m sure it makes sense
How many x specials do you typically use in a run?
"I'll take your entire stock" intensities
Memir B and his Ludicolo squad
They be dancing in the rain so casually.
duking was told about leg day once, but what are legs if not lower arms, so he worked out his arms more
When your arms hang that low they’re legs
mark literally just told me I wasn’t allowed to take this game when I took the Wii today
Ay, you got my name right first try!
Oh so he talks about me does he lmao
That Espeon’s defense was looking a bit too high
@Sanaerys_ i talk about you on stream when i talk to you does that count
I need to go finish setting up my splits for tp glitchless
@TheGlubbers I don't know, I was just being stupid- I mean funny
@TheGlubbers ty ty, it's the depression /jk
So Rash is guaranteed no matter what IV you are
that hitmontop is angry cause he wishes that when he looked up he saw sky
I’ll be lurking. Lai made dinner, and I’m about to go into a food coma
She made fried chicken and potatoes
im leaving to meet variety for dinner in lunder 30 min
going to uvil at 5pm is gonna suck KEKW
I gotta speedrun the moment I get home. Gotta setup GDQ OBS so I can do comms for tgh the 16th lmao
I love Typhlosion! No worries, Phantom. This Typh won'tlet you down. <3
I get home at 6pm, and my appointment is for 8:45pm LMAO
that's still super easy tho ice
like comms obs is trivially fast you could get home at 8:40 and be fine KEKW
I also gotta make sure Windows 11 didn’t fuck me in the ass while I was gone
Don't look at the two missed crits and the nature.
it's funny i see the arena and immediately know "mt battle" cause maddy doing attempts at it in XD lol
Bot has been on fire lately
@lordofduh Hey thanks! I appreciate it! <3
I forgot this trainer has multiple Trapinches?!?
If you pb I'll shove my cigarette up my ass and draw a stache on my ass
Thank you! It was last Friday. PartyHat
That's why I'm confidently saying stupid shit
I'll worry once you're around venus
If you pb, I’ll also shove a cigarette up Pichus ass and draw another mustache
Ice I'm gonna draw a fucking penis in your ass
I've said turkey, finger, pencil, pen, I think cat at some point
Anything is possible with a little commitment
Phantom you’re missing out on this dinner
I think I’ve moaned like 5 times eating this chicken and potatoes
OK so Lai is the man swifNotes
After dinner like this, Lai can be whatever she wants
why's my cat so damn touch-starved
Oh hey there's the cat I shoved up my ass
Did you not dig the houndour?
If you have a slimmer thing of respect towards me I hope you read nothing KEKW
I hated this fucking trainer for so long
I won't address pikaclones as the goat
That is the fastest fight I have ever seen
Just cause it takes 2 turns and it took 1
I wonder if hundo ever uses umbreon
want to hear my favorite dumb orre-related factoid
@swiftpichu_ probably not bu no snags does
I'm just big plusle fan lmao
if you purify the roselia from XD and transfer it to another game you can give a seel a kiss from a roselia
Being alive in a Colo run is a blessing
fave guy is beaten on pace?
cause that's the only way for roselia to learn sweet kiss
That strat is slow but is such a good backup for stuff like this
We love plusle in this house
tippiLurk phanto274Lurk rhacodLurk while having dinner
I see my personal nightmare so ty for pointing
Love this game hope runs going good natsunamiRave2
All part of the plusle experience
I've liked minun more than plusle
Fun fact no matter what iv/nat combo that plusle is it will always outspeed, because those geodudes have 19 speed lol
What about the old man who used pikachu he was pretty rad lol
Give the old folks a breaks
I'm waiting for phantom to get the Pikachu win
Plot armor pikachu is always clippable
Hell yeah, losing to Venus. that’s the spirit
You gotta pb for pichus sake
There’s a cigarette on the line
Ice I swear to God I'm gonna stick my finger so deep it's gonna look like I have you as my puppet
You'd need more than a finger if you're promising that, Pichu
Just know that I’m drinking 2 gallons of milk the day before
I'm afraid a whole fist is just kink
And I am very lactose intolerant
It's fine I'll eat taco bell
what are y'all threatening each other with in chat
I really hope you PB so you submit this run with this chat
I think Ryz's notes have backup for if catty dies, but my notes should have it too
Swift let phantom's run die, please KEKW
Wait are you doing fast banette?
psychic blaze kicked in there Pog
Or it might be for lab death idr, but they weren't when I last used them
That's the spirit! Keep the run alive!
I even have a bunch of safety stuff in play as those notes are meant for safety
Yea you might want my notes then
If you hate being safe I also have a version that's got no safety stuff
Do what all of us do, just play Pokemon Unite
Pokemon Lets go and unite are so dope
Ice, that's a MARGAINLY worse idea
Of course Buff, but hear me out
Open some packs in Pocket phanto274Smile
I like watching a friend be toxic in Unite, but I don't do team games
Rider Nelis, the streets are curious about what you be riding?
this thing has been Fire Blasting too well Susge
Back to the lab again isolar2Catjam
big dumb idiots don’t know you have protect
Oh you are doing lab death
Maybe I should write notes, I like using Zeke notes but they have 0 hand holding (Which is fine for me tbh)
I did not cause I assumed you'd go for maku catch no lab death
Ok maybe I do consider writing notes then
done with dinner and we dont do safe
I just like how I write notes better (I am biased)
and that's still the safer pape run
I will shrimply write lab death note
I will shrimply make it speed guides live compatible 🤌
Yea tho I assume it doesn't translate the exact same as google sheets where I used ~pretty colors~
Oh the double protect I like that one
Might have found out another thing I may need to edit/check with the damage formula woo hoo!
It's that I realized it's type1x type2 and not (type1 x type2)
love how they used the 64 models here
Anyways yea so in the formula rather than being in parathensis it's just multiplied with everything else which can matter if your number ends up being a decimal
Beat Venus at a hefty cost of time
It would be off by 1-2 at most
There's a heal machine down when you walk towards venus yea
I have no idea wat Rhydon is about to do
But you're probably right it probably does toxic, just like crobat protects
It all comes down to this
20 levels under wil do that
This run is in shambles now.
I can do damage formula stuff I got you
Don't trust showdown I've learned lol
I had a disagreement with showdown on a calc yesterday and I was right
Oh you know what there was a heracross fight that had 0 iv set
I think it might be this one
There should be stats on the side too
Oh fuck yes I don't have to lube up the cig
Odd I'm getting the same stats for 0 iv neutral heracross
you can't just ask that of a streamer
You be nerds, I'll watch football
Also make sure it's set to Advance generation
I'm watching rams vs vikings bitch
If not then fate doesn't want you
also what are we nerding about, I'll take that any day over american football aka Spend More Time Between Plays Than Actual Action
Or hear me out, you can burn rng while doing laundry
The short of it is you got a bulky heracross but also yea the sheet misguided hard
That is the only one I know of yes
I did copy the data over it was pointed out before long ago so I’ll fix it
Hope the RNG is with us this time
Most optimal run: Always hit fire blast, don't get KO'd. EZ
I am the devil's advocate yes
had to pop out for a bit, how did the run die? Make it to Realgam Coliseum?
Pray for good RNG idk lol
Damn that’s wild it kept trucking
I saw Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare tonight
All we are missing is the Water/Ghost starter
Since there's no starter with that combination yet
Man, even speedrunning Colloseum is difficult
I watched a video of someone getting every shadow shiny with RNG manips and I thought, “Speedrun maniping doesn’t look too bad right now”
Trying to think of my favorite Pokémon from every region
Either Spheal or Sceptile for 3
phanto274GG got a decent run off the ground at least
GL on your runs Phantom phanto274GL
phantom is always good and awsm orange a great member.
I shared it in #suggestions today
also icebound said everdrive pape is possible, it will just take time
im just glad to know it can be done
pape rando discord is doing a pape only AP async, we have 8 people lol
I learned today with dk64r there is a tracker that can display the song playing if its a dev branch seed
peache114Yawn  guess who just crawled out of bed
im living  in shame axl leave me be
RNG on your side tonight with that pull
I’m going to attempt it again tonight lol
I need to look at Glubs video again cuz it wasn’t clicking
Yeah I just need to stand in the same spot then figure out the visual cue from there
satellite u sacrifice a panel of ur or opponents
and it gattling guns 2 boxes ahead
During your time did you work on any projects that got leaked
I was watching Kit and Krysta talk about their experience so was curious
the soundtrack is a banger NODDERS
school comp goes way too hard
how much damg does it do? 15?
youll save time if you draw it on iceman
ive seen dalus do it a few times
lmao im not really listening more lurking bcuz im working on  vods and all i hear is "when you go shopping with a girl and she wont shut up"lmao
do you run faster when running against the walls?
why is it called power plant when it's not plant power
ALL UR BASE R BELONG TO US
Darn it was a great one
Doing AP with pape, how do i turn on auto tracker?
gotcha ill just do it manually then no worries
if you pb I'll shove my UI goku funko up my ass
Looks like I'll be in vegas again in the summer lol
Evo is doing official side-games with full medals and shit and kof was announced first
I'm planning it out with mn friends rn
Also top 8 is back thank god
battle network chads who up for some late night gaming
Don't worry woman also walk away from me
Maybe the game thinks you do
Glad you enjoyed the vomit formula in sheets sixeTada
I should probably consider getting a job doing excel sheets lmfao
I love making stuff like that so yes I would
Hopefully no terrible game bugs to prevent a phanto274Gold
Ayo, gl hf on the run(s)!
Haven't got any yet, but good to know
Done with duties time to enjoy a stream
Capcom's favorite BN character is Mr. Match LUL
Isn't there, like, some kind of super niche competitive scene for some of the BN games?
is that based on the actual charracter or the just the design?
BN6 has an online scene, they found a way to play online thanks to the GBA wireless adapter
hello escape, nice to see you this encounter
ermm... i meant to say "BN3 Resetter" KEKW
but yeah i used to watch symes
Ive been around, hell ive been following erothaur and kilios for over 10 years
Yo what's up man (of mega)?
an RNG manip in a battle network is precise?!? no way i don't believe that at all
If you pb I will shove mirby up my ass
KEKW i come back to that message
We're a veeeery long way from having a beef
spare a chat member a subspace emissary run in the future?
BN is the best game man. Never gets old.
Don't threaten me with a good time
I'm an x/zero fan and I hate BN
Motherfucker do you not remember my first BN game was network transmission?
I'm not an X fan, but I am a MMZ fan
I'm sorry I take it back
It is cool, but it's extremely fucking jank
twas ok, tho i died all my runs lmao
hes playing jp version so no lmao
@peachedpocky I know, but let me dream
Alright, imma head out though. Goodluck with the MegaMan Battle Network 532 run calami29Boingus3
I ask myself that question everyday, for 23 years.
Or even worse, a degen psychic
think you meant to spell psycho
If I was a psycho I wouldn't be here
One thing is talking shit and another doing shit
Yes that’s right it was all my luck
Why not start with the first game though lol
Start with 2 and play 1 later, or just skip 1?
Why is that dude passed out LMAO
he was just laying on the road
I have to run my laundry is done lol. Good luck with the rest phanto274Smile
Spaghetti I havent eaten in 2 months
Yeah but I just got back and needed to express myself
Probably sit in vc later tonight or tomorrow so we can talk about this run
i always giggle when you kill one of them as they move cause the smear sprite
i did my first timed segemt of tp
yeah i got to faron twilight at 31:46
Great 1st hr but alas din time gonna phanto274Lurk tippiLurk rhacodLurk
you should play a non-rng game like colosseum :)
just get the right frame 1st try
also i just saw that message you sent do all friends :)
surely they got 7 hours to spare
i found it funny you got 2 escapes in battle 2
like it really wanted you to get out
"even we know this encounter is trash, go on, get out of here"
i was actually gonna suggest myth KEKW
you played tales of graces f at all?
the remastered is out today been having fun re playing it
Hey Phantom, did you know 0.01 CAD equals 0.069 USD? isnt that so nice?
i couldve just said 7 cents yeah but this is funnier
I accidentally clicked on the stream and had my phone in my lap
We all hate BN1, welcome to the club
it have 1 of the best combat system people have said they don't like the story but i like the story
and suddenly heard voices talking about the 0.069 American cents, and axelhad JUST finished messaging me abt jt
so I thought I was hearing shit
al I know is vesperia is one of the better ones, never played it tho... this is the xbox 360 exclusive right?
vesperia combat is good but i think the game sucks
@Axl_SR ps3 in jp only also then ps4 and pc switch too i think
Xillia 1 is what got me into tales
I like graces f a lot too
or just get the ps5 version of graces
I have graces f ps3 physical
funny thing is you get the grade shop right away and its max out you can start with anything on if you want
I heard what digital foundry said
Ttyd remake is bad for speedruns too. But i still feel it's a good remake otherwise
i got returns just so I can play it on arcade stick like I did with tropical freeze
just a fun silly way to revisit
@iceblue My new audio technia headphones are limited edition ice blue LUL
Hideki Kamiya saying Switch 2 leakers need to be destroyed is so real
are we gonna find fast guage in the bed comp again?
ice, its the same as bn2 style skip if you're aware of that one too
I just got here to open the folder cloae the folder open the folder open the folder
can't you not jack out in power plant?
did you see how jugoombas bn5 runs went today?
All I caught was reset on knightman fight cause no drilarm1
and what do those get you
there is a free backup in scilab comp
then you do the Chip Gate ASE instead Kappa
the best way for ice to learn this is to run it himself KEKW
I don't know how it works, only that the result is you flip the bits for the complete flags to unlock gold duo
I still don't have them all in this game
we gonna see the TalkToDesk manip?
lemme guess, you only get $2.50 of it still
Ice, did you know Ms. Mari has a twin sister? So if you left her kidnapped no one would ever know LUL
so chips are more likely to appear in their original spot
Every 64 in game steps there is an encounter check, the first few hundred steps the chance is 0%, then every other encounter check it increases 3% > 6% > 9% until around 45% or 49%, then its just a matter of how many coin flips you win.
I find 43 funnier than 69 LUL
Smog made an alphabet soup emote LUL
if only Escape J+K+L was a PA
you escape but also get a reward
you escape and then turn off encounters until you jack out
not true, you go to school to use the subway Keepo
oh hell fuckin yeah ice, you already know
these fish guys have hype animations
If you pb I'll shove this fish so deep up my ass I'll float
oy that the nerd i was just chatting with in discord :P
it's okay he had his music
also i find it funny that the anime makes the kid an entire unique character and part of the group
why is it called water comp when we're not compensated for it
elec man scenario music goes crazy hard
that or the battle theme might be my favorite songs in this game
the game also cuts the encounter rate
they coded in to turn you at corners, so they clearly thought of it
it was L, you could've picked it
i tuned out after you beat up a scotsman in the oven sorry
i could read if you weren't skipping all the cutscenes
you also can't charge at all without charge 2
i still want to cosplay her at some point
just need to lose weight lol
FireMan in the dub got renamed TorchMan too lol
What is Ices knowledge of this and who is in the lead?
ice's knowledge of this run is "wow the sequel's run is better"
ice don't do that to yourself, not even at my low this morning would i be willing to torture myself that much
in the anime masa had a secret identity as leader of a crimefighting trio (with sal and miyu). his name? COMMANDER BEEF
hold on i have live footage of ice right now
the funniest part is it's perfectly in time with the BGM
i gift a sub to myself
i wanted to even out my bits lmho
Pride1 one gay bit to even mine out
v0oid has his effects all set to 69 bits so i was uneven lol
Twitch presents real american heroes. Today we salute you Mr Battle Network Speedrunner Guy. Without you we would be forced to do the unthinkable... playing BN1 ourselves. But you can finish it in under 2 hours. On with your god awful RNG you battle bad boss RNG, not drawing Escape chips, and failing polar bear skip. And why do you do it? No really, why would you play BN1? Regardless, we tip our hat Cheer100
there is a glitch to this fight, not sure how it works but protoman takes damage everytime he steps lol
is that just hitting him with spark
oh, you need clues to find WWW Area in the undernet, this leads to to Higsby memo, teacher memo, and pa memo
i like to think that those stops are still there but lan never needs to go there so he doesn't
but it's also funny to just imagine the trans were moved entirely to new lines
yeah, M-Cannon can take out the life virus aura. Good Idea
lie down. try not to cry. cry a lot.
wait, the WWW Door chip is just something you can get off an enemy?
maddy said "What?!? Guts being useful for something?!?!? BLASPHEMY"
you should head into internet 10+ for chips Kappa
invis is one of the best chip in the series
now you can redo the trader
you can even save scum it
pretty sure you can buy D Barriers at most drug stores
YO IS THIS MY FAVORITE SPORT FOOTBOMB?!?
this is the run of all time
are you comparing to sum of worst now lol
that was rough, i see why he's the final boss
Endgame and just in time about to popesTreat tippiEAT TreatCorn
GGs on the 36 minute pb
Hey Phantom! Hope you are doing well today
Too famous for your own good lol
i mean lets be honest here
when you click the RANDOMIZE button that's all it takes to ask for that
starting without boots is really fun to watch
What would be amazing is early boots
take it from me, someone who had ocarina on adult fishing in the ZOOTR she just did, and had required golden gauntlets cause she forgot to turn off trials and found out they were behind talon cucco game where the weird egg was in hyrule castle fairy fountain
although that seed also had the hilarity of having medallions set to anywhere and yet having shadow medallion be FULLY VANILLA
lordofduh called the early Kooper too
I look away for 5 seconds. I didn't even notice they got Kooper
hello I hope you are well
when do you do hotfix? I’m sure have said but I haven’t been around much lately been pretty busy
I didn’t realize when puzzles are randomized the colored boxes in the toy box are too. 😂 I have to write it down because it’s so long
Yes back in time and seems pape bonus content
there's no ice potato on me
the most precious coin in all starborn valley
I got 2 quarters in my car door
guess you need to leave traps on
my twin sister thinks it’s entertaining
I like traps. lots of instant gratification turned to rage quickly
that’s the worst it’s happened to me so many times
when is gdq hotfix? gotta make sure I tune in for support :)
I'd also tell you to fuck off
I'll join vc and you can listen to me snore and fart
yeah ill be there for support for sure friend
and gets the quake badge lol
ask for quake and you shall receive
When you get a chance after stream go post in my discord AP channel
thanks for the pie. I mean bomb
love the fuecocco plush and the plush next to him i think its an octorok
is there ever a point to d down pound
So. I can't help but point out a confusing element
Why do you need to test the rando settings before hotfix when you just hotfix them at hotfix?
Just hotfix a good end time 4Head
im thinking goombario might be here
there's still a fair amount of checks out there to get anyway
just got done yapping about all masks on hotfix which was fun
what kind of estimate are you aiming for
shame shas had to call in a substitute host but glad you had fun
it was, i played axl's reqiest game
you are cool, you are rad, and you make fun content raid
Love the skin, can you believe smash ultimate took away fire mario
i told them to say that you are cool and make good content, but thanks axl for just spelling that out
You're gonna be on GDQ? That's dope af!
hes been there a few times, he did an event a few months ago w tp rando and glubbers
right right pax, i cant differentiate events
that race was great, I took a screen cap. One of you was on final and the other was on Bowser??? witth he caption "this is such a close race" LUL
I remember you doing pokepark, based game
GaySex GaySex2 Looking why is this a emote
its always really cool to have a dev on the couch
are you doing the dumb laki trick?
speaking of Tubba's Castle key @Axl_SR
oh right @lordofduh the stream is done so ill hop in rando VC channel
the guys are waiting on my AP items LUL
im gonna lurk and grab more iced tea
oh joy where was the goomba
you don't need that many repel gels? bold call Mr 5 HP Kappa
life shrooms don't grow on trees, but apparently on bushes :o
he didn't intend to, but ended up skinny dipping
so for christmas i got a pokemon cookbook and there's a recipe for shuckle berry juice
i just ordered a milkshake from cold stone and basically just did that recipe as the milkshake lol
the recipe calls for vanilla yogurt with banana, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries with pomegranate juice. couldn't get the last bit but i just got the rest (with vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt)
yeah it's a basic smoothie mix lol. it is also tasty indeed
also i did submit a small logic update over github
easy fix, train station bushes only show in logic with bombette
I noticed during my AP this week lol
im go mode now, icebound is waiting on my koot stuff but im rushing for final now lol
WHY CAN I BLOCK CRYSTAL BITS ON BIZHAWK BUT NOT ON HARDWARE!?!?
still no tubba bubba castle key?
what are the chances of that?
don't think it's part of the rando algo to troll the runner
i have broke logic in the archi im doing so much that im beating my game in about 15mins
i dont have my light arrows
I just got a 7 cap on hallway starting at 8 dmg
got phase 1 to 69 LUL
um no cant say i have
well shit that a lot of damage
nah, I said no to GDQ lol
Brother we all know that's wishful thinking
phanto274GL on finding the ideal settings
So what was added to try and get it to the ideal length
ahhh god content hello how are doing
ist thiis new setting blitz or just a rando
what do you have on is i can ask
so basically what you were doing before but without the beta stuff you added?
your last run on gtq was have startet with suchie glich
An 🍎 a day keeps the Juniors away
what do you think mirrow mod on gtq ?
just mirror your x axis too and it's the exact same as normal :P
on the first chapter of the run woud be funny in gta is mario cant do nothing my opinient littel bit enoing but funny
i just pry of a good seed
I found you're stuff on YT the other day for the Nightmare random I just finished that a few hours ago
General Guy fused with Argorok to make a flying tank
That's I'm shoving a seed up my ass to see if I a tree can grow up
All you need in life is bitches
So how about that airline food
why do i have never think aboud that just just laki
the blocks on beach are not rando?
we have out of logig boots
hmm, so i haven't been getting emails saying you've started streaming. will unfollowing and refollowing fix that?
nop that what we dont whant
yep thats all turned on, just haven't been getting notfied at all
but i got axl's notification so i dunno
i ahve persenaly erverthing mutet dc or anithing but i guss for the gtq run i mayby wanna aktivate then
geez that top bar color is something else. gl hf o7
i go to beat lurk of phone gn
It's just for Koopa Bros actually
i mean gerneral guy was posebil but a littel bit rng
Because they can be literally unkillable
What's Rowf set to? All 5 sets?
what when are bots on mout rugget
For Chan it's Boots, Goombario, Sushie, or Watt. I suppose we could add Laki, but I think currently it's kind of like throwing a bone in regards to battle logic
Kind of brutal if you ask me
That's why I wanted to add at least Watt to GG logic, but everyone was like "let's not be too hasty here"
Right. But I think the KBF boss is the only one that's in any way likely to be that early, right?
Did you include the bombette skip for the toybox wall pre GG?
Haven't had time to look over the PR besides taking a glance
tho I noticed the bombette puzzle skip change is incorrect. Not sure if a fix before after sunday is a good idea because it's a weird edge case
Missed the start where you probably mentioned this, did you add longer BC?
Aight, curious what the time is going to be
I mean she's been in the box without refrigeration for over one hour
I dip my balls in the Burger King soda dispenser. if that offends you then you can leave this country, snowflake.
y'all were supposed to copy and paste that
my brain was so confused by this music lol
I dip my balls in the Burger King soda dispenser. if that offends you then you can leave this country, snowflake.
burger king is already gross enough
potentially, but i have to die by my slander of BK
i've had it one singular time
and i will never eat there again
the last time i had BK it was just the most digusting burger i've had
so even though i used to enjoy it i just can't anymore
i was linked to a online tool that lets you spin the world map in like all the different types of projections and i turned africa into a potato
yeah i don't think i've ever been to burger king without a catastrophic event following it
are you not gonna deliver that mail?
parakarry is going to lose his job
My moms Eagles are going to the champ game. Now its the ravens turn. GLHF on the rando madness.
iirc the koopa tower is technically still bowser, but the koopas separated are their own enemies
you found the chef of bowser's castle
if you leave now you might just starve them out
I saw a group of ants today. I saw a fucking group of ants today. And these ants were just doing their fucking thing. Ants. Ants? This lowly form of creation, ants? Ants? Do you know how ants do their thing? Do you know what it is to be an ant and do your thing? You fucking work. All day. All night. 24 hours a motherfucking day. Ants. All they know is work, that's what they exist for. The queen fucking ant, queen bee, whatever, she needs a fucking lair. Well it's time to get to work ant boys! Le
phanto274Nom ghunzoNom rhacodNom NomNom time so will be tippiLurk phanto274Lurk rhacodLurk then.
for the record that was hilarious
also i am back from finally doing a long-delayed self-care
I saw a group of ants today. I saw a fucking group of ants today. And these ants were just doing their fucking thing. Ants. Ants? This lowly form of creation, ants? Ants?

I haven't been here, what kind of settings are these?
i've always loved that this glitch makes you go "oh no junior troopa's frozen in ice! anyways"
the legendary scarf of true power
so today, because of retroachievements, i learned there's a one piece tactical RPG on original gameboy
Oh this blooper is last, huh
but still, of all genres on all systems
Go mode! (Assuming you can clear Bowser's Castle)
Should be a fairly quick endgame then
Checking the panel but not the block smh
I guess power badges were cheap?
we just don't need your go mode item in the middle of the fucking desert again
also these settings were terrible they led you to getting goombario
oh good I can actually chat now
My twitch hasn't been letting me chat for 2 hours lol
2 sets of shoes in Toad town
It's because Watt bled onto the hud
Hammer or bombette would open this seed up
Funny option would be feesh for something under a panel
What the fuck is that following you
the random BP needed for badges, I'm guessing it's a range like 0-3 more/less than vanilla and not completely random, right?
sounds like what you're saying is that randos are so random
I was just making a cringe joke
it was good, we did a lil weekly race together
with drak, levias and axl. 7 chapter, dungeon/boss rando
how's the settings for this one?
This one fuzzy will be it's new name
Bow was half off on a different shop
the idea of Bow realizing she can be bought for cheap LUL
That upgrade reminding you of a shiny new pair of shoes
what a good trick to join the stream to lmao
runs of what? nah i'm kinda of out of the loop ngl
i never could do this trick period
hitting 1s and then a 10
yo phantom! I won the race
also everdrive has arrived in my state. Did you X7 come with usb cable?
and someone else already got the SRC page so i can actually just enjoy learning to run the game instead pf stressing routing it
What's the estimate gunna be when you do the run?
whelp my Ravens 🐦‍⬛ ended 🆙 losing but enjoyed a snow ❄️y bike 🚲 ride out. how goes the finds so far? Oh a 🆕 seed.
love the closing of the eyes just then
Just to look fancy or use as a head wrap
you took the star piece from the quiz guy but not the from the tree
Bucket and scarf in the desert
will we find the goomba lord
i really hope you have to do this for the gdq seed
If only the dusty hammer could be used as a one use hammer
One use as in it'll break after and you have to go rebuy it
so far an upgrade melody and a ruins key ouch
yes on thursday so just grinding away!
i used to have wr but now i'm 4th. 2nd and 3rd have mid to low 1:13's and wr is a high 1:12
i want to get a mid 1:12 and then asses to see if I wanna do the 1:11 grind which would be about 1.5 mins from sob
yo have fun i'm gonna get my dinner that's been waiting monkaS
Maybe the hammer you're looking for is on snowman's gift...
He was here last time too
Just one position to the right
The million dollar question this seed "Does Merlow have a phanto274Ban ?"
Nah it's fine, train is here
Sadge only if  farore's wind setting was pubilc
this is so fun to watch :)
hammer behind anti guy would be funny
getting boo's portrait can't compare to this
it's not a fish, it's a mammal Kappa
rogueport news hear how does it feel to be a mario without a hammer?
At this rate it's more and more likely that Merlow had it
100+ checks surely a hammer will be one
hmm purple fire pink camo cool
i am sooo tired have fun papey sparkleYawn sparkleYawn
YES i am a mmbn enjoyer!!!!!
not enjoying MMBN makes you a bum
yeah that event we gotta be a little more less ... kinky on main LUL
i don't think helix wants us to talk about that LMFAO
@Iceblue I'm not hearing you CAN'T be freaky on main, tho
If we wanna be invited back
How much to fight Amazee Dayzee
Don't you mean vanilla Crystal King?
sorry ive been lurking and saw you got up to this boss lol
This seed has one hell of a twist when it came to the hammers
Guess where the last hammer is
Spear Guy could have lived but instead chose the afterlife by Stone hammer
only 3 screens away, bro could’ve done something
Here take this shooting star and go rescue your child yourself
he’s a yoshi, couldn’t he have eaten the m bush or something
all that for a sfx badge lol
also this seems like a fun seed
Guess where the final hammer is?
For all those who just joined us
I just guessed on those lol
I've got the stream on 5% volume yet Raven STILL hears my audio
those 1 coins are just the bee's knees huh
time to glitch into blueberry patch
I can do a few glitches but not all of them some are very hard to do
Rosie actually has something of value today
my birthday is 2 days away
you can just barely see the outline of the walk way in the dark but I can see it.
"didnt see this guy" in pitch black lol
but that is really cool you can do that without using watt
How to easily beat a Paper Mario boss: Shredder Strats
mario can walk on water it’s a miracle!
It's only been 7.5 hours and the average working day is 8-12 YEP
Just get a ✂️ and it's auto-win vs all of PapeMario
Then again Paper Mario defeated a pair of scissors
Paper Mario is the paper that beats scissors
@jc________________ then that means rock beats paper
I can’t wait to see that
ive been lurking for a while
i was doing a rando with 110 power stars but i was missing 10
goombas and koopas being the same color makes that worse
I haven’t done power stars yet. I figured when I got better that would be the time to try it.
Just use aim bot and then you can't miss
part of my concern is that the spoiler log seemed to suggest bowsers castle had power stars but I couldn't get there without all 120
um I didn’t know that’s how you did that. I thought you stood on the middle and just let bombette fall but that makes way more sense
i remember needing the last pair of boots in a jail cell in order to have the height to hit the ? blocks in the sewer
This one is a real stinker
The worst item in the game
“Where’s the key?” right fucking there I guess
that's where the key was? was it your run where the tubba blubba key was vanilla some days ago?
French vanilla in the worst way
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Today will be Chinese dim sum for me for dinner
Just had my bi-annual teeth cleaning
It's going to be 7 bp
Your pathing shorts have been really helpful btw
When I left you yesterday no hammer and still no hammer
Doesn't this combination also get you to ch5?
i just got back from running an errand. Found a USB micro, hoping thats the right one for the X7
i beat the pot centipede and got you a bubbleman chip. i'm sorry :P
did you just bomb the block and get a badge
oh i was ages behind lmfao
i was wondering if bombing blocks works in vanilla lmao
Goombario came packaged with an upgrade
just never thought to try that as a kid lmfao
Lemme know if you want jcog and me to watch out for backtracks this bad during the seed vetting
I only watched the first hour of the second run from yesterday. But I peeked the finish time, and oof
Okay, so we're looking for something not sub 3:30, but also something not completely terrible...
Super early general guy with nothing
We might need backtracking though to get anywhere near 4hrs
Early to mid game BC is the way to go probably
oh. Yeah that's awful in almost any settings
Anywho, gotta bounce, gl on the rest. Also pls send me the spoiler logs for the past 2 or 3 seeds if you still have em
Hammer does the same as Jump x1 so Jump was always better
Again berserkers aren't known for brain capacity and instead watch weapon go smash
Now we don't have to use the awkward way into 7
Doesn't help that in this case you couldn't get rid of the Tuff Puffs easily with partner
i mean.. games done quick, its in the name
Nice nice. Will definitely try to catch the hotfix. I'm glad PMR is gonna get some attention
dungeon and boss rando for pm is seems super interesting
mario: heals all the time enemy: heals at all (hes cheating)
Oh I just noticed the different bosses on the tracker, that's cool
Just finished the meat sauce and linguini and lookin pretty solid on ur finds
yeah i got it for about that much when i snagged it, friend showed me a sale that knocked it down that much lol
If it was a Watt star though
Just learned paradox pokemon in the anime just make sounds and dont actual say their names. Truly the unga bunga of pokemon anime language. Cheer100
guzzlord just screams, so its basically Goku LUL
you have mods, put there asses to work
Im telling Rigby I want your hotfix settings to be season 4 LUL
i heard something about a mod? need something
I never laughed so hard at a single emote use
id imagine youd have a better time find clean japanese audio than english
yeah I was gonna say I'm sure someone's ripped the game audio at some point
maybe not for the modern ones but certainly for the older ones.
of right, pokemon cries! My dumbass is thinking the anime cause thats what I mentioned first
Probably your favorite mons and mons you use for speedruns
cant you just rip it from the fan made pokedex apps? The ones ive used have cries
Hence why the Espeon and Quilava cries
oh pokepark would be a good starting point'
there i finally found a funny one
progressive undernet rank in ariel's grotto
what are you doing with that ariel
Vanilla bowsers castle 3 times in a row
Looks like we need to make sure that doesn't happen for your run
Enjoy this music because it's stopping now
it wasn't even C O N T E N T bad
And now back to the vanilla speedrun of Paper Mario
like a bad seed can be redeemable if it's at least entertaining in how bad it is, this was not that lol
your splits analyzer seems to be more accurate about my resets
No wonder the child was imprisoned in the castle
this game is so good and fair
holy shit 5fp power bounce lmao
honestly yeah but seeing it drain 20fp in 4 turns feels wrong lol
you sure you have enough repel gels
dylanjGG phanto274GG rhacodGG popesPOGGERS tippiWin marcoWin
great end to a ravid seed
i think being idk 70 mins under is a problem
just in time gotta go to cheer on my buckeyes in the title game
Fuck ME, it's cold as HELL
hopefully not more than 4 either
this 1 is a 407 Kappa
i oneshot woodman with a fully charged atomic fire and he left 50 rupees for you in the pile of ashes that used to be him
streamer's too cool to homeward shroom
Still fuckin worthless of a character
man pretending hes not wearing boots just so he can jump on his friend
we can *see* the boots mario
someone whisper devs, get them on the barefoot mario start sprite
If we all did 5 dollars
37 people in chat, < 3 dollars each
the fact that your "dollars" is 10k bits LOL
"hi everyone, i brought a bomb!"
You're gonna shove nuts in bloopers mouth
Have you ever considered how blooper feels?
What was he doing with those
I was wondering where I left those
Sorry I was trying to dry them
and we got to see you throw nuts at blooper
You skipped like 5 on mountain
What if you put on slow go
I can contribute 883 bits towards the cause
what did that penguin do to you
why do you keep blowing him up
is not even ONE wall in this game save?
been trying out the Going Commando AP and good lord doing endgame planets with no armor is brutal cause rn everything is vanilla damage. phanto274Cry
hey - better that then random planet difficulty making early planets a nightmare
cus I mean - R&C games all have had new game + options, so like... KEKW
i wonder if you can NG+ the AP lmao
I bet you could, just that it would not be really helpful
like - unless you wanna do nanotech level sanity that is
cus I renember up your arsenal (thats the 3rd, yea? I always forget the names and go 3 cus over here it was 1, 2, 3 and then the title which I didnt memo from there) did have another 100 nanotech levels behind that
or hell - hear me out, something which could reasonably be added from NG+ stuff: higher bolt multiplier unlocks and weapon level based checks
and then Deadlocked was the 4th which was called Gladiator in EU iirc
only had 3 as a kid, thought the series was interesting, but cus I didnt have the money to even think buying into the PS eco, it always stayed an afterthought
but yeah lotsa stuff is locked behing NG+ in UYA
going commando also does have a couple more weapon level upgrades behind NG+, no?
i forget cause i never played GC much, ik UYA does and also the RYNO is locked behind it iirc.
If you pb I'll fist Jon
@SwiftPichu_ fuck you KEKW not open for business PrideLaugh
@SwiftPichu_ I KNOW that now swifSmug
That's what I get for being degen, jon is into butt stuffing
@SwiftPichu_ that I did not say KEKW
I just said that to your degen hypthetical, I aint open for business for you KEKW
Unironically me being me has indeed backfired on me
A guy already tried to flirt with me KEKW
I was already prepared for it to backfire on me anyways
As I also knew I was gonna be banned somewhere eventually
huff'n puff chose to be of the frost kind today is all
whaaat you dont want to buy the coin? BUT IT WAS FOR ONE COIN! KEKW
Oh yeah its party city tonite! Lookin pretty solid on items on the 2nd go around
I was hoping for charmy and the "hey you found a KEYY!" one tbh KEKW
so the story of this seed: mario has soggy feet
What item is behind star pieces?
can you toss Goombario in the trash as well
that was a lot of life shrooms
ya know... I shouldnt be surprised...
but somehow seeing new kinds of "fuck walls" moves in a videogame get me despite that tippiGiggle
cmon red luigi, get up there
the setups that take this long are evil
@buff00n only because the game said so this seed PrideLaugh
Just threaten to send him to Minish Cap
i am back from the gym
So it's hard to randomize Bowser's castle location huh
Since this is the fourth time that it's in the same place
how many things do ya need in bowsers to progress?
I did see parakarry, laki, bow - didnt play this in forever, so I dont know
Think all the partners minus Watt
ahh - ya still got a good ensemble of partners required for bowsers castle though I wanna guess
glitch logic, fair either way me brain thinkin "what if the dungeon randomization goes and is silly"
I swear, I hate this fucking keyboard man
again eating what I am typing out - had it eat entire words already....
guess rando's gonn rndo w castle placement then
"hey Peaches gues what! Twilight Princess is playable in AP" "Axl! You cant just come into my stream make me drop everything and not not help me test it!!" KEKW
it became playable a few days ago, needs more time in the oven
so..... why cant you beat it......?
fowl top chest had my super boots and it didnt send, had to manually send it
also you cant really change settings either
makes me renember how sunshines AP was there for a bit, then cus of a variety of issues between 🐬 and delfino plaza state nonsense were rough and the person behind it got busy IRL no one picked that up from there >.>
being rough - my brain forgot the sentence I was typing out mid typing it seems c.c
im not sure, github i see WritingHusky at the top of the page
the bottom mentions help from lunarsoap
meanwhile me out here specifically not playing MM in AP because of that...
so the map part of your trackerr will be dead due to new logic?
@Axl_SR it should work as long as phantom doesnt also update the pack to use the new logic
and then once thats done, it again will work *shrugs*
WritingHusky...is it a bunch of awoos
but emotracker doesnt auto hook to any rando out there to pull the logic from there straight up
as it is now I can do it just fine without a map, I just like the convence of being able to pin all the hints
I mean - that you'll still be able to do regardless, unless its a new location tippiThink
how deep is the ER rabbit hole opening up, if you heard any of that
super silly question, but: ooccoo nest or some such for the per dungeon ooccoos? swifDerp
I know OoT has C buttons in the pool. You cant use the button to play the ocarina until you find it
do you use simple 64 or retro?
oh yeah there is that to lol
thank you for letting me know good luck with your gdq run
We had that happen in the last seed
That is the seed that was bad
stupid in a good way or a bad way
And Bowser's Castle being vanilla 4 times in a row
The Espeon and Quilava reset simulator
To the point where their cries are now in your memories
And no 5th Bowser's Castle is vanilla seed
Swift, have I told you that I work with rotisserie chickens ?
Good, shove one up your ass
Goombario start? This seed's gonna be ASS
What happy meal, sushi and dressing in the same place
Whelp time to pay for a feesh upgrade
Damn, hard times for squirtin'. Sheesh.
taking a break from my rando to eat I’m hungry
If it consoles you a bit, i managed to fix the partner menu cursor for the next release. Rain's fix had an off-by-one
I hate when they summon another one.
All this from a WeLoveGoombario start
Just one more to Ultra Hammer phanto274Ban iceblueBan
Yeah I've been thinking this one would've been perfect
The right kind of stupid for entertainment
Can we add 3 more of those sections
Just the right amount of silly and hopefully not sub 3:40
It was a hammer but not the right kind of hammer
I mean. We can probably bridge a bit of time after beating Bowser by talking about the rando itself. Maybe show off the doopliss easter egg
Lurking in the background listening while working out. GL!
kooper is so jacked now just like luquiid after his workout
man my brain is smooth today. i'm sitting here going "why isn't phan jumping?" ...... you don't have the boot /facepalm
calling it now, boots are on mountain pass (if you haven't been there yet)
@lordofduh is that for sure or your guess?
the boots are in jr troopas play ground
We even have the stinky pass
No way!! Bow's room without having boots, I've never seen this actually required ever, I wonder if it actually is
What would you do if that check was a progression item that you couldn't get to?
Errr i guess you must have thrown it
Lmfao someone just posted the entire Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie on twitter
This was just posted 8 hours ago. So I guess it was reuploaded
I guess I can pop some popcorn and save 93 dollars instead of going to the movies
Oh wait I forgot the drink
not gonna lie, ff15 was disappointing imo. it started strong, then kinda went downhill for me
i'm going to be brb, giving baby a bath, if boots are acquired, i'll ask about it :D
i think they are on mountain pass still
I feel like ultra hammer would be good and bad since while you could beat volcano it also opens panels
yesterday was rough my hamster decided to die on me. 🙄
Not much we can do with the cycle of life, hopefully they lived a good life
but I did get flowers and chocolate
@rgamer0 he lived 2 1/2 years and they are suppose to live about 1 1/2-2 years
okay I’m going to have you on my phone with headphones while I finish my seed
Okay maybe this jumpless time is a bit much
caaaan we get ultra boots here too
Desert with 2 boots to match with Jade Jungle's phanto274Ban iceblueBan
what happens if multiple boots are on the screen at the same time, would they just both show up as regular then switch once you picked up one of em?
I left for a few minutes where were the boots?
2 of them to be precise
Hopefully they're not filled with sand being out there
Turtle in a cloud frozen over
This seed seems to be too fast
Because now chapters will start to fall left and right
Probably a sub 3 hour finish is my guess
It feels like Bowser's Castle dips will determine how long seeds will go on for
What are we even missing for go mode, Just the chapter 6 items?
As annoying as it is isn't ruins technically beatable at this point?
their parents sure don't cause they don't spend a single second looking for them.
where were the 1st pair of boots
I take it traps were disabled after that first seed you did with these settings
those weren't in the desert argickAngry
Didn't you call UB in TB?
Toy Box being profit as usual
Gotta make sure to ask for the right water
2 levels of BP for 3 levels of FP
Welp, who knows, maybe water will just be here
Water can now just about be anywhere
So how baby was this seed
"Vanilla Ruins" sounds like a SMW level
At least you don't need to do the annoying laki teleport
Probably need progression to be placed in Bowser's Castle
So now we just need chapter 8 keys
Nope on that, we're in go
Would letters or koot do the trick for time?
6hp is especially odd since he has 10hp normally
It's probably again just put some progression into Bowser's Castle and that solves the length issue
What's the minimum requirement just to put the early parts of Bowser's Castle into logic
Sad I'm gonna miss the ending but I gotta go, cya
So they should know what a basic requirement is for the showcase
deja vu from few runs ago
I really wish I could preload FF7 on PC
gotta keep dem hackers at bay for a whole two days
why did you walk past the star points earlier?
or, no nvm it was runaway pay badge
oh ffs, I really need to play this game instead of watching streams of it FailFish
Oh hey power and mega rush
we know how much you love this place Kappa
and you're all outta jammin' jellies
yeah but you can't go back to that during 4 mole fight
I take it this seed has jokes
I'm sure you're sick of me by now, but shouldn't Mamar have Tutankoopa cause it was vanilla?
I'm GUESSING you like fire types
Fire's maybe my second favorite behind Dark
I see the espe and umbre
These guys SUCK at aiming their cannons
Oh the bosses are randomized too?
i got the a whole room full.
yo Phantom, how goes the rando today?
For 15 bucks phanto274Ban iceblueBan can be yours my friend
You could add the peach / kammy koopa fight back in to pad for time
you went live at the perfect time KEKW
Gg on hotfix. That was a really fun run
i seen a lot of it but missed the ending got to watch the vod when it on yt
i'm in pengel mode right now
someone stole the SRC page out from under me
so i have to do it now
i know right, how dare they not realize i was routing it secretly and just do a run themselves
the clip of the run i had found is on there as WR though lmao so they used a portion of a run to get the SRC page
and also are running into the same troubles i was with finding any other footage
but i think my route is faster than what this person is doing
right now i need to just focus on getting fights in as few tries as possible
but they buy a couple unnecessary things in their route
It's so short even having a surgery is faster
I mean you're an hour in
bro had a lot on his mind
Where do you lost time? And don't you fucking dare say all throughout the run
So glitchless debatable and glitchless sucks dungeons
quick with tp? never herd such a thing so long
phanto274Wave gl hf! Good thing this is a short and quick speedrun
I had that thought in my head xD
I'm thinking like... it can't be only that
I mean you got hyrule castle
He was gonna to head there
how did your gdq thing go?
Dude would've found someone if this never happened
anything else planned for this year?
Every time I hop in, I see an even better split 1 phanto274Gold
I wish we could skip the monster arriving cutscene
I got a hi from Mirby... I'm happy now
i did something i never thought i'd do before lol
i spent $260 on two games lol
highest tier version of Civ 7 for myself and maddy
civ's always a good time, this will likely be worth it
its a pretty big series of games
All I can think is civilization army and idk why
first video game series to win a grammy even
since civ 4's theme baba yetu won
that was big for VGM in general, mainstream acceptance and all
and now we're in a world where meta knight's theme has ALSO won a grammy with the 8-bit big band cover
civ7 comes out on the 11th
there's a forgotten land mod that replaces meta knight's sword with a grammy because of that lmfao
Did I miss you jumping into the mist?
Then yeah I missed it lolz
Does the route you're doing differ very much from the WR route?
I had a dream I owed Scott the Woz $500
that right there's a sound i'm gonna get used to quickly
I remember letting out a very loud "oh, HELL NAW" then I woke up shortly afterwards
since i'm doing ape escape for ice's next async lmao
link is on strike for being made to go too fast
Idk how you missed that...looked like a good distance
do u like the doggo sections or no cause ik some dont
even doggo on strike by bonkin?
telling   link is  on strike todat
all the way back to where u came from
ads ended as u got here
Had to go for a long while
I always have just a jingle in head when I see you going against the river flow
You have a resting bitch face too? Huh..
I honestly don't know why they call it that
Oh yeah awsm ur movings and apparently im grooving just got 3 rando digimon packs outta nowhere and got a secret rare TigerVespamon.
Because of your size? I thought you were like... 5'7 or so
There's no way you're shorter lolz
i know how tall they are
Omg there's only one person as tall as you
i just started wii u version yesterday its my first playthrough
i can already tell you're farther than me
what do you mean this bridge has rails
Rain has a rbf too and is like...6'
Tall men just look angry... idk why
im at death mountain and i already have max rupees and im like noooo
knocked him off the bridge pog
She's hot and her music is soothing
my favorite character so far is the old goron that has smoke coming out his body
i kind of wonder what this game would have been like if link stayed a wolf the whole time but i know people would have rioted
Well you wouldn't be able to get most of the stuff done if he was
iron boots -> ball and chain
he could throw a boomerang with his mouth
i guess it would be legend of midna at that point
@TomaThePolliwog That game would just be Okami lol.
midna would do a lot of heavy lifting
Caught some of the gdq run good job
oh true. i forgot about okami
i have an okami pin of amaterasu
im thinking about getting a midna plushie but im not sure theres many options
I'd definitely like a wild link plushie... have our dog wonder what's going on
cmon pokemon company. you made a life size lucario
im surprised at how good the gamecube version looks for being the gamecube version
im surprised this area makes you look up. its so hard to look up normally
I'm being totally normal about a ship from the Sonic movies
Sonic is greatness that Shadow performance and narrative use is timeless
My baby like cat has climbed onto me
Indeed hehe, and i'm doing good
Not awwe lolz it use to be awww
mister yuji naka is uh. well. rip mr yuji naka
ty it really means a lot
i gotta write that down to say during my stream
it was an analog glitch youll get it next time no problems
I only got that right once...
Oh thank God I can breathe properly
He was laying on my chest up to my face
Oh no I don't lolz it was just that
I was gonna say you have allergies yet you have a cat as fluffy as chucky lolz
I didn't think people could adjust to pet allergies...I figured they would try and stay away from the one they are
Should have a timer just for the climb for shits and giggles
how long left of run me need sleepys
fine ill stay up to 4am then  hmph just to watch u
3-4 depending on bonks and "link >:("
or untill i pass out like i usualy do i ususaly have u on till me paass out
there was once where i passed out and idk if u raided or twitch bugged    i  got woke up by someone i dont know getting over excited
time for worst dungeon in my opinion   if u ignore irno boot parts in eldin
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
@darkapplequeen I feel somewhat the same because of how tedious it is
Can't pet the doggo though... link had the eyes of a fierce beast
Also he's not potty trained xD
Punch the rat... punch punch the rat.  Kick the rat... kick kick the rat. Now kill the rat... kill kill the rat xD
Sorry I have an overly active brain atm
it was nice  (heh) while it lasted
Yeah isn't there a bomb chest in the stalfos room?
i was able to get my sound from ps5 and pc to play in the same headset its so nice
no more ear buds for twitch FeelsOkayMan
i think the stalfos bombs are faster for any% when you do reverse spinner room
@blacktiger51 you get to rub the ears
it took me a bit to remember what you meant at first because i forgot that going through the spinner room backwards isnt intended lmao
what categories are you planning on learning next?
Baby boy stuck his face towards the window when we smoked... now I have a clingy cat who's high
That happens when I try to do the poe skip. I'm literally doing it... but can't get him to climb into the pole
But isn't that the faster way?
done in time to see my fave weaponry
well my first two people i asked didn't give an answer
phantom, how do i get laid, im looking for a refresher
is the answer just use eeveelutions
...this question is like 5 layers deep and i think you're only privvy to like 2
ACTION waddles into a lot of ice
Is your Twilight Princess or Princess Twilight?
I did not deserve it. Supernova abused their powers. And me. More importantly me.
This is exactly the concern about shared bans when it comes out LUL
yo phantom glhf twilight princess swifWave
is there a slash commend to remove the Suspicious User thing for if i need to do it again at some point
ahh i had to go into mod dashboard and wait for them to type again
Can never have too many arrows
finished my first banjo seed today
first seed took 12 hours split betweeen 3 days but I really enjoyed it
I know ive mentioned to you that eggs can be progressive. Well theres actually like 7 different progressive chains for upgrades. Im a big fan of that
that does not seem OSHA approved
Yo Phantom, how goes the TP?
Well at least it helps you get less rusty between now and next week lol
Nice to still be aheadge at least, shows there's lots of room for improvement with some consistency
@lordofduh btw I made a thread in PMR for uploading Yamls
True, merhigh is one of my favourite
Y'know that was supposed to be a resub alert
I forgot those things are in this game
No I just forgot no disrespect to the manchicken fandom
Amishman19 just sent an AI TTS message to the stream!
I should have just chatted but I had to try it that way
Twilight princess... but instead of it saying "the sequel" it says "the manchickening"
have fun with that half of a penny
Was really hoping I could find a helmasaur emote but no dice Sadge Just helmaroc
So can I hate manchickens now?
It's in case you mess up by some chance?
This room looks ass everytime I see you and Monado do it
wait it got moved to average?
maaaan I can't get my furry action Sadge
Alright Pichu, what are you anteing up today for a PB
i think some question are better left unanswered YEP
Listen, I know not to ask a question if a don't want to know the answer KEKW
wow 😮 what a close twilight
we had to count every thing we have in the store and scan it all
Pog just pulled a crown rare mewtwo
Which one sorry? couldn't quite hear and I can check
10 is a little high no?
That just means more free PB's EZ
chat's not on display, is that intended
we'll see what April's like. I'm gonna have someone file for me, and ideally, she can get that money I allegedly owe to something more reasonable
was playing fire emblem fates while waiting
i'd watch you play some old school pokemon TCG that was on the GB thats on the switch
i enjoy watching how fast they destroy that game with the blastoise rain dance
doesn't hurt to try to submit it
then i say we all go there and take a dump right in the walkway
do you know why they always deny you?
start speedrunning those NSFW games lmao
NSFGDQ, coming soon to a porn site near you.
well what about the randomizer races they have, do you think you could get on one of those
I wish I was good at randomizers or races cause I'd do them more lol.
ahh didn't know that.. well damn, can't win
have there been APs done at GDQ?
sadness ads i wont get my answer
i thought they all had man in name  so out of all who fav
I could never speedrun a game this rng heavy lmao
my favorite Man is Flame Hyenard but he isn't in this game and also isn't a Man.
my friend was playing this game for the first time this week
and bro *would not* believe me that he couldn't S buster lvl a single random enemy
i told him to skip to 3, or at least 2
but he wanted to do it in order
Oh okay I just thought of a terrible pun and I feel bad
he does not like the number of random battles
If you go watch a Broadway show, does that make you the ... Phantom of the Opera?
@Zeliversal no, because broadway doesn't have operas
any game pre-2006ish has way too much random encounters tbh.
the joke doesnt even make sense
Phantom of the Opera is a musical.
I'm aware, but he can't be the phantom of the opera if he isn't at an opera and is instead at a musical
ah okay lol just makin sure.
I've actually seen phantom of the opera on broadway lol
but i get why people don't
@AudioBlood bn in general, or BN1, specifically ?
I always find randos to be more interesting than speedrunning tbh, but I think this is one of the more interesting speedruns to watch personally.
@buff00n bn in general, this is definitely not a strong point in the series
but then theres me    who waited  a hour and half for u   even tho no idea what playing
some reason i was watching u 4 times
was funny when hearing u say cool 4 times in row
@AudioBlood Was trying to tell someone to start with BN3 instead of BN1, but they refused to listen to me
@buff00n why wont they listen to us
yeah I mean it was like a decade between actual mainline MM games right? Just a billion spinoffs.
Yes made it for the start. How is everyone doing?
@AudioBlood 3 = 6 > 5 > 2 > 4 > 1
3 has the better story, but 6 gameplay is phenomenal
I think I just got tired of 6 eventually, it lasted a bit too long
only BN game I've played is One Step From Eden, I enjoyed it a lot, maybe I should try BN.
to me its 2/3 1st place tie. i love 4 and 5 story line. as for starforce the gemini twin constellations in teh anime and game were bada$$ kinda like starscream in transformers or dinobot
how do u know the numbers  is there any way to know or just guess
so far cause not reallt watched this before number man section isnt nice
I love SF's stories but I am NOT a fan of the Card system and your area being 3x1
Even though Bass broke bank in my heart, shademan and the dark chips with duo made things so much more interesting I dark beated both red and blue and
hiya glhf with whatever this is swifLurk
yea those cycles don't seem convenient
take care hopefully future runs won't be as brutal
get the ass RNG out your system, that's the strat
damn I just finished eating lunch lol
made a breakfast sammich, bowl of oats and a cup of yogurt
heading to work, gl on the runs
good luck with the runs today
Peaches said she won the Switch 2 viewing raffle
I’m gonna need a nap before work today.
hey just wanted to say your pm rando vods have been keeping me busy at work nice to be able to catch you live keep up the awesome content
No like where gift/bit lb is
Go to my chat and look
back room is cleaned for the new washer and dryer tomorrow. now I’ll nap
Me I have the flu type A so rest is in my near future
Only good thing is I caught it early
that is caught the signs early
the game over jingle is choice
If I ever wind up streaming speedruns I wanna use the Total Distortion game over for mine :D
If you pb I will stuff a duck live on stream
Really? Says the one not claiming to be a degenerate
i know the other swift is here too
Swift is more wholesome, I'm just a dick
LUL too bad I can't post videos in here cause I'd post a very appropriate response to that from an old TV show called Red Dwarf.
You know I get why I'm timed out constantly now
Motherfucker you did it frame 1 you got the sword
I'm sorry. Do what to the stove?
I mean the stove is hot so it makes sense???
Cmon give me your A game
I always go to bed IN SHAMBLES.
the game is clearly telling you to escape the fight LUL
im not familiar with mmbn tbh
good luck with ur run !
woah twilight princess is so cool
why is fireman so big omg
i always imagined him as a tiny guy
its ok no more random encounters rest of the game 1 in a million odds trust
when do you get the run chip
yeah, and regardless of getting a pb the practice is nice for an event
ive never ran at an event before- it sounds exciting
i like ur lines on the overworld
But what if I wanna do it do it
makes sense, i noticed a couple times you walked towards a diagonal instead of walking up right then right
sometimes i pause on an autoscroller because losing time on an aurtoscroller is funny
its crazy how hard you can get trolled in this game
im curious though, do you have to use sword for him?
i assume that you have to or its so fast u basically have to
i have to go i wish you luck!
Nothing will ever beat the triple quake 3 you had in that marathon
Yeah they're heading to the water works facility
Ah ok cuz it says last day of attempts something
U going back to paper mario
You gotta join the next multi. We need more yamls
I would love to see Phantom do a multi
But didn't join this one haha
There are some games that are just really rough for multiworlds
I really like PMR in multi though
Chip trader bouta give you 5
Phantom I need a favor that will be both little work on your end but significant for me
I need you to be a witness when I sue Mondo for skipping the 297
You just have to say *He said he would do at a 297" and point at him innocently
So in good news and bad news. I got a lot of work done on my project today
It was just more... Sideways than forward
I'm working on a bot for a site's API
Dex has no clue how to use guts
strimmer don't you think it is silly that you have to play this game in another language? Kappa
if only the mods would make it english only
like repel in pokemon of sorts
do u get to go shopping still tho
is that what the kids are callin it these days
Jack in to power up and Execute
Got to get to an event its been fun.
this was probably the least fun fight casually for me by a big margin tbh
tho it's been awhile so idk if there's been worse that i played lol
Ever thing you will get Tera Man?
And each is like 1000 Mega Mans
But you let me stay anyway :)
If you want I can double up and sue Monado for killing your runs
Pog You will be entitled to financial compensation
FUCK YEAH LETSGO SAD TIME I FUCKING LOVE SAD TIME
i wish someone would jack into my oven
everyone's got their own shit going on tbh
just an oven looking for a squirter
thankys for stream again phantom i gonna try sleep i gonna leave u on in baackgorund
hey if it's not too much to ask could you check the poptracker discord when you get a chance after stream ends?
That's a thing in this game????
Glad to see Lan finally backing up his net navi
i knew you could do it chip tarder
Oh Phan...they got me the boot and after a month I should be fine
Which means finally my first stream will happen in March and I'm so happy!
How have your battle network runs been going?
Hope you get to play if they do
Rolling into that just broke one I saw that xD
After that I'd wanna redo too. It's always the ones by the shed itself
Hey at least you can do goats again
its faster to turnaround, then quickly roll while turning around again at the beginning there btw
gl i now have windows 11 out of basically force so i'm annoyed
it was inevitable i just chose to embrace it now not later
yep so i'm looking into addons to fix shit like windows explorer
yeah my immediate gripes are the explorer, why tf is everything rounded windows, and why is the taskbar so tall
oh and the whole centering my applications thing, i like left justified
Like I tell everyone... well as I can be lolz
ya i heard of the setting so im digging
mid when are you locking in
Later when I’m not crashing to ook lol
i hate the sound settings change
twitter but not run by a dipshit
without as many haters but you can also nuke them into oblivion wiht the block button
mai can't believe you just herded 20 goats apparently
idk windows doesn't let me click on the clock and see the fucking calendar anymore apparently
why is that an extra button press
i don't have a need for a virtual desktop in my current situation
instead i just have my main pc and my work laptop is on ubuntu
like i don't do any work shit on my main pc so i keep all those apps on my work laptop
i'd considered doing that to like, restore a work session with slack/work email/github but if it sucks on w11 i'll just not
because i do *some* work from my main pc but only ever like, slack or a quick logistical thing
flying enemies in a video game fucking you over? that never happens.
oh my fucking windows isn't activated because it was a shared product key with my family years ago
and now it's associated with the account not the device. fuckers.
okay now i have an activated fucking copy of windows
so i can actually change advanced audio properties on my fucking devices
@TheGlubbers for some reason i imagined your funny phantom zant clip except you fighting windows and just talking to it
i think my favorite part of that statement, doopsie, is that i have to ask "which funny phantom zant clip" because the exact same thing has happened twice
the go to the middle ill suck your dick clip
bizhawk is fuzzy and make me drop frames like done other and I just started streaming lol
the main difference is the clip ending with "nice" in the first one and "i can't believe that worked twice" in the second one
you should have enter forest temple not ending blow lmfao
this is like when i watch oot hundo and the split is "forest temple" and they're in fucking water temple
theres a segment that gets some gold skulltulas and stuff in water but ends by fwobing to forest and killing phantom ganon then doing a wrong warp again
but it confuses the shit out of me because it's the forest temple split and they're not in forest temple KEKW
i have possibly also called it cursed to him then
two hacks i was waiting on retroachievements for both got theirs finished today so that's nice lol. that solves the "don't know what to play" issue i've been having
the fuckin volume mixer isn't its own window anymore it's a god damn widget
Yeah I seen that it’s annoying asf
i use the volume mixer to mute my cap card's audio since it plays directly to desktop
Free ride into the pond NODDERS
you pay that tileworm with either cash, grass, or ass
Nah ook would be out for blood if it happens again
i've run this game for half a decade nearly
and i've crashed on ook exactly one time
did you try looking at his hands
karg crashing is way easier i've definitely done that at least 5 times
imagine if that was the bit frame
can't wait for you to choke PB by one second
im concerned that i'd just win
i don't think clearing a 6h time is gonna be hard for me even if i'm reading a route KEKW
oh can you juggle it to the other rock
"this is probably my worst forest temple ever" game: aight bet
phantom come on. this is twilight princess. you can only lose time to goht in majora's mask :P
you lost more than that laughing about the stupid void after rang
oh right the glitchless route has this hype part
And talk to the postman KEKW
this is why AD is better mid
there's only one postman skip and it's at the end
Olaf spent this entire morning parked on top of my chest, demanding affection
i love that you can put the postman outfit on link in hyrule warriors
he's currently on my lap, still demanding attention
hyrule warriors 100% speedrun sub goal pauseBedge
it was on the twilight princess adventure map
I feel like I’ve heard of Hyrule warriors but never watched gameplay
you singlehandedly take out hundreds of foes
should i put the money for sgdq away now
bad sides: agdq was this month
yeah i do technically just have it, just makes me feel bad to put that much aside after spending that much
"technically" meaning "i have it and am putting an arbitrary conditional on something that's just there"
eh i'll do it next month
you ever consider how much stuff you mess up trying to get these bugs in kakariko
people returning to their homes to see furniture knocked over and stuff
i forgot you blew that house up
really good sure, but you need 17 more for it to really be nice
17 more for it to be 1nice
ew RA Roulette started this week and one of the achievements is have goombario join the party
thought i'd look and that achievement for paper mario itself has an 84% unlock rate. that means 16% of people remembered goombario was in the game and stopped playing :P
well that's a new one to me
i've seen clips there but not a sidehop
this really is a run of all time
usually its people getting hit by a goron and clipping
why am i seeing so many people posting "paid rent" and being upset
do people really pay rent on the due date
i can understand waiting for paychecks
I have mine set on a schedule 2 days in advance cuz I get so anxious about missing it lol
my rent's due on the first, i pay on the 20th
credit cards i play the balancing game to maximize credit score more
Some people actually request to set it around the time of when they're paid
yeah that's why i pay on the 20th anni
that's when i used to get paid
current job i get paid on the 15th but still
yeah 15th and last day is current job
other jobs i've had have been the 5th and the 20th
5th and 20th is just consistent dates but functionally identical to 15th and last day
It's a lot better separating bills and necessities rather than paying all at once
i can see it for ease of bookkeeping
my student loan and rent are the 19th and 20th respectively
everything else is between the 1st and the 5th
I have not yet paid off my student loans
oh yeah twitch is like the 12th
it goes in a fund i don't look at often. that's why my sgdq is already able to be paid for
The college fees in the US are stupid expensive NOPERS
and i'm still riding the cushion i got from... not streaming for 3 years but people staying subbed
@midnaliin yeah I wouldn't really have that large of amount in student loans if my household was doing a bit better
But I cared for my family so
Yeah for sure. I just find it a bit unfair the US charges so much for college. it’s not as bad in Canada (yet)
i'd like mine to be paid off
That slug is the worst KEKW
I uh had like adoption certificate which the government paid for college
I just realized that’s the actual entrance for Lanayru twilight lol
Lake Hylia?! that’s so far KEKW
Wait for the karg to be closer to the ground before you do the first one. it makes the regrab free
All I heard was “I’m surprised you know how to do it” so I’m watching Adge offended KEKW
Okay what’s this about you’re surprised I know stuff lol
I do because I don’t do karg drowning
True I need to do all the crashes now
Is that where you clawshot argorok weird?
I’ve seen it but haven’t done it lol
it's so dead at work right now i'm literally just relaxing watching the stream with my feet on my desk lol
it's like how matt murdock is a really good lawyer. it doesn't answer the question of how he does what he does but it's true :P
That's why horses get scared when you yell
man catches a brick thrown from behind him while blind with his bare hand and his only explanation on how is "i'm a really good lawyer"
one of my favorite jokes from no way home
I say throw a bomb arrow at him instead xD
Yeah escort is by far the worst part of TP
@buff00n sorry I wasn’t fully paying attention wdym?
it was just doing some test asyncs Rigby made.
Ohh I see. yeah they are all horrible KEKW
I don’t know I’m not super fast but mazarus said to give them a try and see what I think
they want feedback also for season 4. the fastest one for me so far is with the 40 power stars and 4 chapters. 😂
I play for fun really. I don’t have a set time I stream some days because of work.
woo 60k more points til VIP lets go
i do try to catch everytime your on and lurk or have it as background noise when taking care of the spawns
I'll be unemployed I'm guesstimating for a few months
Probably start a job after SGDQ
What do you do Phantom? if you don’t mind me asking
me every time in lost woods
i agree with phantom, it was pretty rough
it's a good thing it's all a numbers game WICKED
Late response but I think AMS skips MDH right?
can't wait to be on my TP arc this year fr
stupid dog you made me look bad
Eyo, gl on the run phanto274Wave
Yea I saw that. Had my mind all over plando though
I can prolly play around with your code a bit tomorrow. Think I'm basically done with plando
The second one is much not exciting
More omg the autocorrect fucked me
wow, you use ladders. i only escalate with pure rope
I never organized an AGDQ 2024 photo album 😔
I’m like “going to the buffet” and it was a roasting pig
what do you mean you cain't skip What
can't skip sure but can i hop
" it'll hopefully sort itself out "
Yeah investigating that is just putting yourself at risk tbf
Omg the Pac-Man ghost is hype PauseChamp
i've been subbed to someone for almost 100 months but she never added badges past 2 years so i get it lol
You need to make the 5 year badge for the OG people NODDERS
U should def do DSS no matter how much i love the death animation
gonna have u in background like usual ye
<3  helps me too with deppresion from hospitl
Hope you feel better @darkapplequeen midnal1Fluffycatlove
just the 1 run today ye  ?
thats only proby with tp    cause so long u can only do 1 a stream
Yeah this category is literally an all day event KEKW
why did the word doggo get  not sent
did it say "this message could not be sent"
cause if so that isn't a block that's just twitch being dumb
I took a nap earlier so I wouldn't be too tired to drink tonight but I'm too tired to drink tonight Sadge
gimme soup gimme cheese gimme all I desire
that's how the song goes right
If you pb I will eat kooper's shell with my very own 2 cheeks
Gimme fuel gimme fire gimme that which I desire
Enter Sandman, bring me a dream, may he be the cutest that I've ever seenn
Motherfucker doesn't even say fire clearly
Gimme fue gimme fi gimme that which I desi is what I hear KEKW
Guess the chilfos said go fuck yourself for me
and u keep going to same rooms again and again
should have said hi as wolfy
I got a golden one you can grab
for me it was frame 3 going into frame 4
just curious can u bonk link with statue  ?
now for link to become birb ans go to sky?
@theglubbers go fuck yourself you Pringle ass bitch
You're ahead so obviously it doesn't suck Kappa
ur very mean to dogs today first the ice dogos now that dog
You should figure out where to stand after you kill the dogs, if you stand where the statue spawns link just grabs it immediately and that animation never plays
Its one of the really dark spots on the ground
Hi, I'm looking at my clock but don't see get good o'clock
How can I tell where in the thumbnail to look?
Saw ya in the live feed Uncle Phantom from Nintendo.
Ordon Shield detected, be good to my son burtooReallyBro
Burn it, and I'll burn you...in Minecraft venomi44Clueless
Every time I say Penny, I have to fight with auto correct because my last name is "Penney" burtooReallyBro
And now, I go take a Canadian shower, with Canadian water, in canadia land. captai2848GREGdance
It means I must disappear like my father, have a good stream venomi44Stonege
How much for you to stick an arrow up your ass
Bomb arrow so you can go out with a big bang
To be fair, could've been worse
Could've been an even slower 7
will be a few minutes, still need to refill everything
You can't get rid of me that easily
I forget, are there any cutscenes long enough that you can escape to the bathroom for? Or do they all require mashing?
Yeah lol. Entering Hyrule Castle is just about at the end of the run anyways though. Not really worth the rushing to and from the throne
Your little ghost dude/dudette(not sure if they're also gender neutral) flopping the Wolf Ears?
also today ur not allowed to be mean to the dogs again
doing a multi, all i have left is artisan cave at battle froniter and BK. While there i found a varia suit LUL
Those children look like the spawn of chucky.
Good luck on the run. SeemsGood
I can finally set my clock
Wait this is a one beast warp?
I always thought this was the first one somehow
But you know what I love more?
No way they dig?? Guess that means you've gotta quit...
why is this game unstable there
cus it needs the object for the cutscene loose and on the floor?
meanwhile the boomerang: "OH LOOK A SPECK OF DUST BEHIND YOU, LOOK OUT!"
can’t say I do or don’t because I’ve never played this
like - they did well in making it big
the postman has his own rules, no? 🙃
pretty sure if he's related to the running man, then something cant be right w him
basically: the running man has the race thing from gerudo valley to kokiri forest bridge
and you just can not beat him
even if you were to teleport there on not started timer, he'd still win
Ok Phantom, just an FYI, I entered you into a race. My code has been running for 5 and a half hours and is got to 50% a few minutes ago. I think you finish the run before it finishes
hey! got your PRs merged, and plando and everything else wrangled onto dev as well. I'm tired now, so ill bounce right away, gl hf
Just play on pace and you probably win
Because you were too busy thinking about Midna and Zelda and the fate of the world and that jerk named Zant
Its okay we've all got Midna on the brain
My chat is not even the worst
I am a civil adult who can have a PG13 conversation
I am absolutely not Glubber's chat LUL
There's a reason I spend no more than 90 seconds as a time in there
Just order a masher on Amazon
I saw one at the store the other day
(vaguely gestures at Zelda Speedrunning community always being mature rated)
Holy balls it’s -23 outside my car barely started and I had it plugged into the block heater all day KEKW
I’m lucky it started cuz I have to go offsite for laundry
Well -23 C is -10 F. So still pretty cold
They have laundry but we had a fire last month and they still haven’t opened it back up
Cuz I think the fire was caused from the dryer lmao
... ok did you want the warm or the cold?
I want warm but not from fire please KEKW
Okay this is true. Open fire in the building was not optimal warmth though
Or even better. Put the fire in a box. Put the box next to tubes of air. Blow the air towards the people.
All heat is created equal but some heat is created more equal than others
Is this dude more or less annoying than Bo KEKW
Oh okay so less RNG involved that’s nice
Just step to the side and he'll almost always go for a grab
Walking upside down is a glitch NOPERS
But it's okay. He only promised to do LESS glitches. Not NO glitches
Anything 87-93 is allowed. Everything else is banned
Hey that bonk saved you from catching fire
This is the first ever run
Very excited to watch the first ever TP run
So what do you think you will call his fast timed gameplay run?
I didn't mean first ever xD
How many parts do you think you’ll break it up into?
Maybe instead of a Let's Play it's an "I Play, Skillfully"
With 20 minute ad breaks and a bonus feature episode
let's play twilight princess part 50: faron twilight!
And don't forget the sponsor segment spots m
where would the raid shadow legends ad go
Should be an emote that’s how I feel
How would that be an emote xD
god i hate seeing those commercials for raid
We would never advertise bug killer here
But you know who we will advertise?
NINTENDO SWITCH 2. (In partnership with nobody)
Do they give you 75 meals as the deal?
@orangeisborange is your name saying orange is boring?
Yeah that's why I was like... How many weeks
Like I'd probably order 1-2 but not like 4
and then the next best part: running to castle town
Is it faster to jump from south castle town?
the spirits block off south castle town
it's not possible to get there in twilight without cheats
interestingly the poe actually exists there right now
er not south castle town itself, the field but yeah
the poe in south castle town field
I use it everywhere it's so funny to see
You bonk on everything. There's an animation
Rain sent me the funniest shit
You guys know the thong song?
"Your aunt mows your tuna" in French sounds like it
okay I gotta clip that KEKW
God the new mobile clip editing sucks so bad
It’s just very hard to change the bounds on either end
It kept selecting the playback time instead of the edge so yeah
Yeah that is a nice touch
I didn’t know you were Kesha Zeli
well you can be singing like Kesha then
I’m telling Derrick you said that about him Madge
You can do it this time
I wonder if you ride fast enough around gorge to just open the gates and go in and it'll happen
That lady is the one who came up with this idea sir
I think I'm losing it, I read the category as "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Bitchless (Any% NTS-U)
Wait orange I never got an answer lolz
Is it the orange is the new black but shortened by any chance?
Damn... thought that was a good guess
Nah he rolled into the goron... they're like rocks
it's ok, X is now reserved for claw
Mr Phantom, water you doing to that temple?
can I send you a video on a foolproof bomb arrow strat
I guess there's no reason to not do that strat
doesn't it make more sense to do it after starting the flow since you want to be moving towards where that clawshot target is anyway?
does it actually shorten the cs? I'm not sure
Give me a month or so and I'll time it for ya
I was doing a speedrun of an early access game that I am the only one running lmao
it's fun though. got a new PB
That was funnier in my head I'm gonna say
Yeah but he only has one
I've been telling him to have multiple like me and he just won't
Something something having a life smh
People just don't wanna work these days. Pssh only one job
i hate to say it but this temple was the worst in terms of understanding what i was doing
i was like what do you mean the stiars are a slip n slide
blew my mind i was like NOW what do i do
@tomathepolliwog did you try going up the slip and slide stairs the first time?
stop calling me out like that
I hate practicing palace but I must do it
Eel can't see... you finished him in the eye
of course i went up with the iron boots how else was i going to get my miiverse stamp
Oh I forgot it was on the actual wii too omg
it was on gc wii and wii u
wii u replaces a lot of the rupees with miiverse stamps
No wonder they won't put it on the switch
wooo DMCA strikes here we go!!!
lol its just like the lost woods
Just get a strike according to the D-M-C-A
pretty much copyright strike of this music
phantom is "unauthorized" to use it unless he pays a licensing fee basically
DMCA is an act that defines the copyright of digital works. It's what essentially makes digital piracy illegal. It also makes tampering with digital protections illegal.
3 frames of input delay on rolls YES
is the HD version mirrored or nah?
you should play the wii version, that'd really fuck with you lmao
How did they not hear you bark
idk if its on every TP but i noticed on tphd sometimes out of certain actions links direction isn't accurate
I just tried to time mirror with an h
like if you finish climbing a ladder sometimes it takes link a minute to snap to the correct direction its a good couple seconds
Rain: hey baby...why do seagulls fly over the sea?
Because if they flew over the bay they'd be baygulls
Wait if I made that joke I'd be banned?? XD
I’m playing yugioh and people are actually insane how long they take to play KEKW
its because in yugioh not reading a card can cost you the game
Do you play the blue eyes deck df lol
Does that also apply to magic the gathering players?
That’s what I’m playing rn I have the runick deck
but I do have a blue eyes from starter deck kaiba
wow that was a fast turnaround on midna
It's not a game. It's a conflict resolution method
all it took was a quick glance at zelda and she was like aw yeah i feel better
I played it when I was a kid, I grew up watching the first anime and gx
Literally all conflicts can be solved via a duel
actually dpad is really hard to hit accurately on GC
are they gonna dub season 4
it loves to bias left or right
I had to watch it in japanese
the dubs are corny in a funny way
the first anime is especially funny
D: You're not feeling the flow!
that the 1 with xyz monsters right
We should all have an anime night
Ok but that's because 5Ds was hype
i wish the final season of 5ds was dub Sadge
The duels were just... Chef's kiss. Like Vrains was nice for the complex strategies but I hated how characters just got tanked
I really like the final season of GX
pretty sure 4kids lost the right for 5ds
but that is probably because I didn't watch it until I was an adult and it was new
But 5Ds really felt like every character gave their will in every duel
midna taught me something about myself after 9 years of forgetting to finish this game
you should throw in an abridged quote
Is the game developed and published for a game console?
my solution involved one belly bump
oh sorry. i forgot to explain my other story
i can't believe he solved it without making them belly bump
midna to me is very playful and i think i see that in myself. but to everyone else im legitimately skull kid
I love dancing with ladders NODDERS
You'd think Link would have learned how to climb ladders faster by this point
they should have just given link cucco wings in this game
just look at the detailing on the wood
@AnniLyn2 tipsy with some epic tp gameplay
the z-button on GC controllers is ass
The gc controllers today you mean... original gc controllers had a good z button
The z button gets sticky man...
I guess if you had original for so long it's kinda meh to tell
As you said some of the old ones were good some were bad
Gotta say though... the analog was easy to fuck up xD
Because most of the characters have ranged attacks?
ngl i was a bit scared there
the biggest thing is dashing iirc. Cause in Melee dashing is dependent on frame perfectly going from deadzone to full on the stick which is very controller dependent and super finicky.
Idk we can do dashing pretty fine without modding it
Figured if you practice something enough you'd get use to it
if your sticks are shit, you can practice only "so much"
Oh no it was hard at first...like luigis slide
I mean people used to play unmodded but I think it's been about a decade since UCF became the standard I think
That shit was hard to do for a bit til after a while of practice
coulda put those on ebay for casual gaming, hooly
or were the sticks that thrashed
see I hoard gamecube controllers because I like collecting them
I have like 7 working ones
@darkness3827 ooohh okay now i...forgot about time passing
yeah if you don't do it frame perfect you get 7 frames of turn around animation. Which is absolutely massive in competitive.
not denying that, just thinkin that "oh yea uhh throwin'em away" sounds a wee bit "huh" 😅
yeah in UCF the window is upped to a massive 2 frames iirc so it's actually doable.
inner fixerupper of mine be like "whaaaa"
fixing the stick box in that thing sounds like a nightmare tbh
how would that be the board - stick box, I get w it being potentiometer sticks PrideLaugh
I get like tweaking your controller itself instead
yea so the potentiometers - the exact pieces of shit I have been havin issues with for xbOne controllers for the last like 4 years 🤣
I heard there hasn't been a melee tourney in a while
not since december or so, they just released a new top 100 ranking
so there'll probably be tournaments again soon
you got halleffect which has physical magnets for neutral and axis recognition and ya got potentiometer which is resistor based
@Midnaliin bc in a couple thousand units of a product sold, x2 for the amount of sticks, potentiometer sticks are cheaper to mass produce
@jonxhas there was a tourney in December?? I missed it omg
so everyone (nintendo, xbox, playstation) use them
it just enforces there being more controller sales to some extent
Will you enter in next melee tourney?
whereas you COULD do hall effect sticks higher costs in production but also overall more durable, precise sticks
EXCEPT when those deadzones dont help cus your stick goes down BAD in drift
like - my current one has a 70% tilt on right stick upwards
that just sounds like the deadzone in MM
whats worse is that its only there when I dont press the stick in into held button
but who holds down the stick that harshly for hours on end
so I am assuming my stick doesnt necessarily have drift, but the box of the stick itself broke somewhere or partially got pulled upwards on that axis or something
I might be one of those people
either way nothing I could fix now
as for what my preferred fix would be? getting halleffect sticks to replace'em
cus from gamecube onwards, hall effect stick boxes exist
its just that nintendo, sony, xbox dont care about puttin those in
but I'll let myself be surprised by teardown videos tippiGiggle
i feel like they don't care enough they are sitting on money
cost of prod per howevermany units they consider -> lots of moolah in the thousands or millions of product
I assume thats why they increased the rubber thingy atop the stick as per how their video looked
to prevent a wee bit more dust from getting in
I'm still trying to send my joycons to them but I keep forgetting
fun bit: its a couple cents roughly per stick to do, not literal USD amounts per stick
so it rly is only noticeable once you get into the tens of thousands of sales
but where ya can shave costs as a company'n such
its probably the handling costs that are more expensive and shipping
cmon tp, this isnt OoT logic
guess which console's controllers had hall effect sticks throughout
but still failed cus the stick casing was properly shit
they used such a cheap ass fuckin plastic that over the course of you casually playing a lot of games on it, you'd get those grey ish crumbs fallin out of the case here'n there or see it in the stick
and bc they back then didnt have the stick casing figured out well, they went to what everyone else wa using
Mario party 2 was fun as shit and Dr mario was so competitive with my grandma and me
yeah i don't get it either. happens on wii u also
Idk you hit him twice and paused and did the normal hits you usually do
either way, me rambling over small things 😅
sometimes link decides to normal attack and have insane delay instead of doing the crouch strike
Oh right I missed the rest of yesterday
sandman? okay now I am thinkin of clayface
By the way my code estimate is still 3 hours. So...
"love" my parents btw - since yesterday, the heater in my room's been icecold
room at 19C right near my PC 🙃
2 to 3 colder if ya take a step away
i hope the humidity is low
It ends up hot af in the room with the computer on and door closed
uhhhm... avg humidity for indoors living areas I'd say
Oohh that's how you do that
I've found spinning the stick slower really helps with it
Gotta find that good in between
wait hol on - this just the input display or is your L button gettin pressed while you're spinning by you or nah
Omg I forgot how much I love this games soundtrack
You know I just realized I could have made this run like 16x faster...
8x or 16x. Depending on how I do the math
oh hey, just peeked at weather outside, no shot am I just imagining it being cold - outside its freezing temps SMILERS
every part with midna is a good part
If it's still snowing in Florida then you're not imagining it
just on a whack ass sleep schedule over here KEKW
Not why I said it xD
the entire time ive been in florida its only snowed twice
thats like 25 years for me
No it's fine...I dont even know if it's still snowing there...is it snowing where you are?
you comin towards what time rn?
yeah Germany is like 6 hours ahead of me and I'm EST so yeah 3 AM
Yeah dark that's usually how I do it
east coast +6 is how ya get germany, +5 for british
its definitely not your usual time to wake up at local midnight , that much I can guarantee KEKW
like - my sleep schedule's fucked
I say stay up til night... shower... and then try to go to sleep
oh come to think, phantom I might have a couple questions for dms (not necessary to answer like today but rather a curiosity "soon") if thats okay
Insomnia kicking in early this year
k will send away then PrideFlower
the snowboarding song is so good
oh! can I ask for that to be a weekend thing maybe?
I know its stupid to ask, but would like to be able to watch it, and starting end of this week, I assume to be hyper busy weekday
Hell yeah Morph love that game
would lean big into fridays done, fall into bed, wake up hyper early on weekend to watch
ofc only if it specifically lines up, cus the pallet cleanser thought goes big
I think I want that ice cream now...
wait does she not have painted toes on gamecube
i guess it will be confirmable later
i only remember because i was like oh hatsune miku toes
Trying to hide the foot fetish
@TomaThePolliwog I'd be surprised if there were model graphics differences
feet are often very divisive. not many people are indifferent
You got a fetish...be happy about it
THANKS FOR ASKIN WHT I WAS ABOUT TO TYPE
Its been a thing for a while
But its a really expensive bit emote
Can't let people have that for free
but hear me out, imaaaagine t3 would get it
allofasudden everyone subs in t3 KEKW
What if I ask very nicely Monado, can I get it for free?
i loved how silly he is when he takes items
It's true. I'm a t1 but I act like a t3
Besides. Emotes don't matter ever since he retired
Monado retired? Props to you Mona
this guy was extremely hard for me
I can't even remember the last time he was live
I never understood how to get to his tail
vanilla? there's clawshot targets on the ceiling
except he doesnt like throwing the ball and chain much without you doing a passingby
but it's a very tight hallway
Well yeah I found that out after watching you
Yeah the clawshot targets are supposed to hint you to clawshot the ceiling
yeah i completely missed them the first time
Oh Phantom, question, when your Monado RSU's vest would you want to sell?
Because I did the clawshots before but he'd never throw it
ya need to pass by him rather closely
He said it's a perk but they take 30 years to vest
So I just packed soup and got hit
So we got 29.9 years to go
speaking of fun vanilla, that chest in the main hall with the swinging platforms :D
doing some wind waker all dungeons
@Darkness3827 the chest you either love or hate KEKW
had a good run so not too bad
funnily enough, I do like that chest
nice. gonna lurk and make dinner. GL!
lmfao imagine if you could phantom KEKW
awww it doesnt say load in english
I never paid attention to that
ive never understood what this room is for
in mansion chapels for rich ppl
because theres no projector and no like. theres no room for a chapel guy to talk
its just a bunch of benches
maybe yeto and yeta took the thing you're thinkin somewhere else
but getting damaged is fast strat
Man too bad we can't find out the meaning of love
the second best moment in gaming history
the first best moment is when you catch the heart piece at the fishing hole
No phone that was one too many
so Midna won't let you just let you ignore the containers in vanilla? lame :( I always wondered about it but never bothered to actually try lol.
its like how OoT any Piece of heart in the open, freestanding is applicable to boomerang. therefore in rando, you can do the same there
Well there's your problem. You got it set to M for Mini, when it should be set to R for Rando...  You know... I rando, you rando, he she me... Rando? Rando, randoing, randology the study of rando? It's first grade Phantom!
i fr thought it just walked off the dge
good thing that chicken always comes back to the platform you're on cus generous resets, yea?
tbf Link also warped in there so Skull Kid just usin the same technique.
i hate this game for freezing the camera as he runs off
I rly wish this skull kid were to reveal where that grin came from PrideLaugh
cus... its not like we cant ASSUME which skull kid this is specifically
my guess is this is THE skullkid, having chosen paint to reflect what happened in MM, with the puppets summoned being a set of 4 and bigger then him based on the purpose of "yea I had 4 friends, they're with me in spirit for forever"
Would you like me to file an injunction?
now hear me out: if this type of jump attack was in MonHun and you could cut tails behind you with it, I'd take it KEKW
but capcom got their hitboxes mostly figured out by now in that game. just scaling them by percentages tends to be fucky
you should just start speedrunning the rando but with everything vanilla.
@Nintendo You are hereby ordered by the court of Phantom's chat to stop messing with his run, under penalty of contempt, punishable by a fine of $0 or 0 hours of community service
I wonder how much time that'd actually save in the run.
Link just got fuckin clotheslined there.
@Darkness3827 in MM, OoT? a lot cus of all the cutscne skips. depends on how liberal those things happened in this PrideLaugh
I was talkin bout this game.
tagbarrel anywhere vanillamizer DK64 goes HARD on timesaves, that I know
@Darkness3827 I know, just was thinkin of what could be potential areas where TP vanillamizer could be faster
cus any place you got rando niceties attached throughout -> timesave potential
fast boots would help a lot I'm sure.
faster text options if its faster in rando to vanilla
Just remember. No matter how bad it gets, it's still faster than my computer running millions of calculations
I guess big timesave for this place would be that you could just save reset to the lobby after getting DomRod
cus vanillamizer glitchless could "just do that" as well
i did the poe in one of those first rooms early by perfectly throwing a tiny statue from like 40 feet away
it was my single pro gamer moment in my 40 hours of playing so far
thats a great strat to memo
even if in rando not applicable
sudden heart attack that lizalfos KEKW
I dunno, there is a floor transition on those stairs yea?
maybe the upper room unloaded enough of its collision so that he'd fall through the ground?
Insert it’s so over were so back graph
isnt there an emote about dark and non dark mode which has that text on it
but only one of'em gets seen based on whether dark or light mode is enabled browser side
aonuma got me on this one with the funny music
I renember jcog had one like that on either 7tv or bttv hol on
Killing him with the bow should be counted as a glitch cause clearly it was unintended :P
THIS GAME HAS RETROACH-- oh no.
what do you mean i have to play it twice
@TomaThePolliwog completed the set over here
you CAN do it on one savefile
but you'd HAVE to do a 3heart run first, then a completionist cleanup through all dungeons again
well. i guess i will just have to be happy with my miiverse stamps
so honestly just do a hundo and then do a 3heart 1 bottle run
for minish cap I know the only thing ya didnt do is damageless vati
windwaker is my fault to an extent as I had NPCs mapped wrong in my head
so you didnt do the goat wrestle, ya didnt watch bees attack someone other then link
and then from looks a bunch of "do this miniboss this way"
or "do cave of ordeals twice"
I just did it at the eldin bridge warp grotto
and after 20 minutes of it not working well, I went and said "fuck it" and chose to clean out that pool a bit
thats how i feel with a lot of retroachievements
there's more then that one grotto where you can get stalfish and bombfish, but bombfish hitboxes are stupid
its not even that hard to make "casual" achievements
so just - take rang, take out some stalfish, as the bombfish come back out
but its always "pro speedrun 1000%" achievements with like nearly impossible glitches
its definitely among the more annoying ones
like the super mario sunshine one where you go a hoverless petey pirhana
you have to like angle manip one of those pondskaters and its just
to be fair, mario games leaning into "light" speedrun tricks is fair ish imo
it is not a light trick
cus you dont HAVE to do the pondskater thing necessarily
you can do y turn spinjumps up atop as well
anyway, I don't want my achievements to be miracles
that one definitely is up there on that edge
but given what speedrunners would say is or is not "light" and all, just wanna say that thats not "among the worst offenders" imo
15 power bounces in TTYD sit there being a grindfest though
or, Sunshine still: the pianta village trickjump stuff
to me light = something you could theoretically do on accident just messing around.
like is there an achievement for playing with a dog using a bone
fair darkness. I assume the "light" in retrocheevos respect goes more towards "easy to learn entry tricks in speedrunning" for what I have seen in platformer related things
@Zeliversal dont encourage "do 15 power bounces while having unsimplifier equipped twice" 🤣
You know. It's kind of funny you say that when that's how I explained to Jacq the bug in my code earlier LUL
that would make it be like what, 10 frame perfects?
personally for me, i would like achievements that encourage me to see all of a games dialogue. stuff that i wouldn't normally see
also the "light tricks" bit being a reason why I will NEVER do LTTP cheevos
cus they START with "oh yea who's your uncle"
Basically, like I explained it to him. My code was trying to perform a frame perfect trick. The game was running at 30 fps, but the monitor only ran at 15 fps, but somehow it still PB'ed
and then turn into "do ganons tower swordless"
thanks for the alert on that blue rupee, game.
also doing dungeons in reverse order essentially
like an achievement for wearing the zora mask in OOT and talking to ruto after you rescue her, she has unique dialogue there where shes like "oh, are you ready to marry me now?"
@TomaThePolliwog you'd like MM's cheevos then
Do maybe if you're lucky you'll PB too Yep
I think the worst offender you got in there is getting the hug and doing the delivery for the mask in one session
but it also got those "oh look at this dialog" bits here'n there cus like - you only have 4 dungeons to 3hearts through
yeah we need a retro-speedrunner-cheevos :D make it all be some ultra garbage shit that's requires like weeks of practice shit.
"do a 120 star run within 2hours
stage ILs I can see ppl grind out
SM64 beat the game with 1 A press :P
like - that shit I can easily see grinded out compared to that
and nobody with these times is going to use an emulator to do it, they probably play on real hardware
so like who is that for
even if its still HARSH time wise
@TomaThePolliwog for those who want to brag
if only it was trackable beat the game blindfolded would be funny af.
beat the game blindfolded is just a forced AR code away tbh
like... there have been a total of 4 hardcore unlocks on that sub2h 120star run
6 total if including softcore which allows for savestate loads
out of over nearly 35k players
its got some INSANE point values
is it not just easier to take off bomb arrows rather than leave it on and disable it every time?
but yea like - the specific stage ILS I could see being grinded out more easily then full single segment runs
one I HATED - forgetting if it was Master Quest MM or Masked Quest
but one of them needed you to do ranch defense (so aliens and milk cart) for all 3 things in a single session
now shadow, recite the bible in japanese or you're the faker
so you had to song of time cycle each time, buy a new keg each time
I don't need to know if your rod is glowinf
I think in the end I had spent like 3 hours just for a single hug after tons of gold rupees
whats worse imo? sometimes single session does mean you are allowed to reset
though doable if you were to nerf marios damage into tankio and went to rawk
i didn't know you were supposed to step on those the first time and i like went to three of them without doing anything
for me it was "yea just do it alongside going through like ch5 and 6
as both overall were at the point where you have access to all stylish commands
hey - better then being stuck in power bounce hell
for those I sat in the sewers on the spike goombas
with D up P down all the way to doing no damage
literally just farming my audience in the game to nothing
i had a camera when poe hunting where an enemy was in front and it was just showing like a skeletons ass
CantSkip City in the Sky true
wasnt that an animated emote before?
btw phantom: kudos on being on 40 series nvidia now
50 series by looks is SOOO fuckin overpriced
the music in this area really annoys me
also the horsepower it got via RAM on it even if that by all means is not near the top
like - you're not doing 4k video editing
i understood this whole area except for where you have to descend from the giant fan, i spent like an hour trying to figure it out before i googled
cus last I know, DLSS type shit doesnt help raw compute power for rendering outside of gaming
either way - at this point, I rly would not be surprised if nvidia might have to re-evaluate if they wanna go pure datacenter or not
cus sure, for LLM stuff it seems like their GPUS are somewhat worth, and so far that train of thought hasnt stopped
even with recent events which were honestly hilarious
didnt know that was an interaction
You don't need to practice it
I think someone stole your talent
Can you think of anyone who would want to slow you down?
Ok. Next chat message is from the person who stole it and will be treated as a confession:
The previous chat message is from the person who stole it and will be treated as a confession:
Cheer100 Shadow: I stole your talent so I could find out where are those damn chaos emeralds
too prideful to even change his name
I recommend it in 90% of cases where practicing helps
That plant wall was so slow it could have been a ladder
I'm shook how slow Link moves on that
No wonder you want to get as high up on that as possible
i love this game for the theming but i think oot/mm is more polished in terms of core gameplay freedom
like you can't even hookshot to chests in this game
whats the zora armor for then?
Damn you can get a huge gold here
if when ya get hit by argorok, ya got trolled
I mean this run you'll probably get a good sized one
what do you mean this isn't metroid
Damn I hate when my peahats get wet and fly away
Yeah I thubj you just die if you get hit with this many hearts lmao
You’re still going? damn this category is long KEKW
@Monado how I knew that before "mobile moment" was "sausage fingers" in a direct german to english translation KEKW
for "oh yea ya just fat fingered"
just dont get bbqd and glod from what I get
Still a better run than yesterday
midna can you stop sounding so sad PLEASE my heart
WHYYY does this game have the restrctions of frickin SM64 KEKW
"oh you cant exit course, you're not in idle!"
Hmm. I have a dilemma. Do I spend like 4 hours to set up automation for something that I'll do once and take me 30 minutes?
what are you doing zeliversal 🤣
this isnt about pokeclicker or something LIKE that is it KEKW
@jonxhas Setting a server, or templating a server image
if ya set up automation once, even if you might not need to set up this specific instance again
could always be something you can set up again at some other time
I'm setting up a git server
But yeah eventually I'll want a server for the bot
But then I won't finish tonight :(
my productivity in coding has absolutely dropped the past 6 months but ive got zero idea why
but zeli - think of future timesave on helping others
It’s slower but I find it easier KEKW
its like my focus is just gone
Sounds like a skill issue to me
or helping yourself in different projets
I could help Zeli this week by streaming Pikmin
Guess you don't want Pikmin then
Actually Mondo could you do it Tuesday?
@Jonxhas You're damn right I have, already played it FeelsOkayMan
I've actually followed the project for like 4 years lol
@Monado same - fuck my right stick though, controlling pikmin with drift on c stick is SHIT KEKW
I literally warned Monado there would be dire consequences if he didn't stream Pikmin last Wednesday, so I can only assume he retired as a way to repent
I did cheevos for 1, 2 and 251 with that KEKW
ya kinda get accustomed to it, but it rly is a double dance of "when will my pikmin just run off into shit"
But @monado I'm flying tomorrow so I'd be most grateful if you waited until Tuesday. Enough to even forgive you for last week and unretire you monadoSmile
You don't dictate when I'm retired
You aren't the CEO of Twitch or Amazon
No. They just report to me. Even if they don't know it
then again - I think playing the dark souls series with a xb360 controller which had both sticks able to just stick in all 360 degrees cus of how fucked it was worse then the drift on my c / right stick there KEKW
had grbo luck on good controllers so far
We already established Zeli is Kesha
Okay then by that logic they report to me since you're an employee under me
It's rough. The satellite internet on my yachts mini yacht is like 1% slower than my main yacht's :(
My head cannon is that Zeli is a tax collector
yea uhhh phantom I dunno how that ends up happening - but its not 0 so it works KEKW
I'm not your employee @monado Not since you retired
I couldn't find the consistency for this clawshot target so I just jump to that wall
Why can't I be a tax preparer :( It's so much more fun to be helpful to friends than punishing to random people
I'm certain there is too but it was annoying lmao
is there anything more going on past flat grey on that wall even?
I demand a reclassification and then I will return to being your employee
Would you like a 10% pay increase
@Monado KappaPride is that 10% of 0 or off of something KEKW
Not you Phantom, not everything is about you
Only if you let me be a friendly tax preparer and not a mean collector l
@Jonxhas Shhh, don't let him know
Phantom, you have to be a valuable employee if you want a raise
@Zeliversal You can be whatever your heart desires
I am full service for Monado. I can prepare taxes, fix bots, make alerts, provide entertainment, serve on the benefits advisory board, etc.
All while getting paid in exposure
Yeah those RSU's are more worthless than toilet paper
But they're worth something to me
Cheer100 I've got your raise right here (kaching)(bong)(yahoo)
Is it because you have my signature
Yo one of my old PBs did something similare
Someone’s sub 3 run did that KEKW
Ok. I think I have an idea that will make everyone happy
I just hate the TP doors alltogether
something about them which is stupid
I like to stand to the left of the lock it’s a bit easier
It's very satisfying seeing your sum of best fall every time I check in
oh shit I didn’t realize how little you’ve practiced this is damn good then
bane of my feels for MM and OoT at this rate KEKW
I think the one cycle strat is pretty heavy RNG as well
My muscle memory was waiting for the bomb refill then I realized lmao
okay that one gets noted down
didnt know you could do that
Ball and chain strat is so cool on this fight
final zant phase is a paintrain imo
i used ball and chain when he spins
if that works consistently, I feel sooo dumb from doing the TP cheevo set
yeah he kind of pinballs around. but it keeps you from taking damage
Do you think you’ll revisit paper Mario 64 at all PauseChamp
is it the one where midna waggles her arms around
and then link holds her in the rain
i got stuck in hyrule castle so im interested to see how im supposed to clear some of the rooms
No bonk into squidna? reset run NOPERS
where at if you recall toma?
its a room with 2 unlit torches
and a stairway that doesn't go up all the way
because its like im missing a torch
yea so right after the darknut
"my gremlin wife is ragdolling herself into the walls and pillars, should I be concerned/
"No, this is healthy behavior for gremlins. Just hold her firmly after she returns to normal."
maybe that gremlin wife just wanted to become a wall gremlin
"I'M IN YOUR WAAAALLS" and all that KEKW
I'm in your SHADOW, in this case
eyyy where you can skip these you're allowed to!
was wondering if that was on that edge case area'n all that
I wonder why barrier skip would be allowed tbh
"game: its for your magic armor so you can use the ganondorf amiibo"
except wii and gc didnt know amiibo would exist KEKW
in the frikkin friends we made along the way
I fat fingered that early oops
wanna stress that there's only 3 which actually did things here
one of them rly just exists
Facts bro could’ve at least did the skyhook quest for us
@Midnaliin better: he coulda also had a bow
but didnt consider coming with more then a book to a fight
to be fair he made two mistakes during the campaign
he allocated all his points into the wrong skills
He just lowkey doesn’t care about Link only the book lore
all in intellect, nothing in perception agility or dexterity yea
What if Ganondorf is up there?
It’s okay Zeli it’s just Zelda
Oh shit we counting Zeggs? 1,
Zelda has strep its okay she’ll be fine
whats best cycle case, excluding type of cycle?
imagine accidentally reversing your stereo and having to do zant + ganon
gotta love Ganon going for stroll
he had enough imprisonment, wants some walkies
he did summon it after all, makes sense
bet he stole that horse from phantom ganon
actually didn't he steal that blade from the dead sage
it was the one that was pierced in him
almost as if this game has a wee bit more exec, less rng influence?
we get what. u and i have two different ideas
like - obviously there's not none
@TomaThePolliwog the afterlife came quick for zant I bet
you should raid toma but tomorrow when hes actually not on break from tp
I bet 99% of your viewers would like them
you should raid yourself this is true
He's about to start a run too
idk i feel like imp midna had better thighs
ads AngyTwink oh wait i have turbo
@TomaThePolliwog Phantom, can I ban this person
Bedge time, have a great night everyone and ty for the stream!
hmm should i add that here
Great job on the solid PB. Hope u have a great rest of day/night.
Hey I mean...we all go through hell
ohh its not a pikacha. my god
oh that was a file name i got here after they said it KEKW
Cause that's all Chaud is good for
last 2 times i joined mid run you were cussing out link cuz he was being a little douchebag
where's the dog i was promised dog
they made this whole mechanic blowing grass and then you get an item for it right?
i guess i can wait 10 minutes or so
we can wait 10 mins as a treat
i've never seen someone flex by holding a fishing pole like that
L target is better in this game than it is in echoes of wisdom
i want this run to die
when will ice do a tp run?
You got called out on ice
I knew that was gonna happen lolz
nah i just have 0 interest in learning 3d zelda games. hence why i bailed on oot so fast
i can imagine oot being ridiculous to learn with the zillion glitches
i should sub 4 that category when i take a break from MM
Morph just come learn zelda 2
i've still not played zelda 2 tbh, never got around to it
i almost had a low 3:58 in my pb but died to ganon lol
set yourself a real goal @morpheus080! sub 3:35
yeah i took damage on a roll frame that didn't give me knockback
link was a bad boy? tippiLurk
gl on the run or runs
so i didn't know i was low health until it was too late and died
also thank for the answers, might help me figure out things a bit
if okay, I will keep ya posted?
@stalkor i do not play 3d zelda to grind glitchless like that so that's not likely for me OMEGALUL
those 3 in that order to what happened all fit KEKW
i finally rerecorded my pullstring lines for that redeem on my stream and moved that all the way over to twitch's alerts last night
are we sure that wasn't the same VO as Shadow?
ooo ooo im also now at 40k/50k to give u a rando
i saw the text in red and was worried for a second lmao
question tho phantom what rando would u wana do if u had to pick
how much for pokemon ranger i havent seen that game in so long lmao
why is gold wolf banned for setting for tp
bcuz also includes all the howling stones
either way ur probs gonna get a minish seed :P
i only know pokemon ranger for the ds, and all i remember  is drawing ALOT of circles
like everyone else i forget that feature
ass so big it can crash the game
Now we know. Phan likes ass
GDQ is finally using their bsky account
Hey all. Success has been had. Chili did not burn kitchen down and is donezo
How has gamin and chat been?
@AnniLyn2 splendid the winner was carrots and garlic
congrats on... *checks notes* not burning down your kitchen?
im so used to lja flying in this place the rotations (wood) give me panics.
can't go sideways on a ladder
Nobody likes that joke lolz my second time making it
oh hey the beeping doesnt continue during the cutscene!
actually thought it would just continue through that
I always thought it to be a thing cus of the Bosskey and hyrule castle wind spinner "puzzle"
so the Z on the ground or the ligtning to follor respectively - had huge issues w it not activating unless seen every time, but could be that it needs the rang throw to be targeting them
and a red I think - some such - nothin of big value in vanilla
either way: am talkin from big "feels like it" vibes to it cus I dunno if its actually like that or not
yea - dunno, it rly shouldnt be but then again its nintendo
and if I learned anything from OoT and MM, its that there's at times STUPID silly things happening cus of draw distance
dog on strike from u being mean other day
fave cutscene in the game bc its right
You can skip that door opening cutscene
I went through Beasts PB and manually entered his WR splits for a comparison a few days ago
They aren't the same as mine either, which is why I needed to do it manually lol
That's a good way to let you know I'm in danger
the moment I start liking mcdeez is when I give up my tastebuds
I worked at McDonald's in highschool so I just don't enjoy it anymore
over here mcdeez is shit to the point where no matter what you want from them, they all taste like freshly unpacked plastic
They're also too expensive for the good quality
I mean I've had worse than McDonalds, but yeah it's not great...
whats the worst thing you made in the mcd @monado ?
Oh I didn't make the food, I was a cashier
compared to mcdeez, round here at least, BK is more where you'd want do be
But I was around it enough
in n out fries are literal cardboard though
honestly im a slut for any and all french fries
Fries are kinda outta my radar diet its all mashed potatoes and homefries for me.
the only thing i've been enjoying at wendy's is their mushroom bacon cheeseburger
five guys fries. yum but also a whole sack of potatoes
I honestly cant say I could rly enjoy any fast food fries unless they're made in belgium as stupid as that might sound
Oh fuuuuck you're so real for that stalkor
something they do where it "just" tastes like slightly salted tato sticks - aka what you'd expect the taste to be
Five Guys prices barely went up either, everything else did so it's more worth your money now lol
I think my favorite fast food burger is Braums
its stupid what you get for a medium fries. it feeds 4 kids for a week
One of my friends worked at Five Guys and while it's expensive, everything is made to order and it's fresh beef they get delivered every day, not frozen crap
I think Braums is mostly just in the southern midwest though
So it is definitely higher tier fast food
no way you walked into his ass
I swear, twitch needs to figure out why the fuck ads playing desyncs audio and video
wtf they just uninstalled your bridge
but have seen it on both
@Jonxhas I would tell u my adblocker but lawyers are everywhere.
oh firefox has it worse yea. i switched to chrome. has better adblock
does it once manifest v3 comes into play?
adblock on chrome is essentially ded then KEKW
my ublock still work on youtube
"kinda" - as long as manifest v2 related addons work still
I forgot what the dates are but its similar stupid to saying win10 shall not have security updates
will be iffy til I see it actually not being an issue there then
that yea - which in itself also is an issue but different thing
either way: the fact the audio video desync has been going on for literal years on twitch now and still hsant been adressed is utter garbo
like - yea, you got amazon breathin down your neck, but that sounds like the type of videoplayer desync issue which SHOULD be easy to figure out
I should be able to see that via browser console, no?
avarie1Notes ghunzoNOTED phanto274Notes thepri67Notes tippiNotes reads well
what were the terms you said it could be again?
afaik twitch does encoding type things on server side, at least thats what I heard last
oh nvm you can easily find that whole thin out KEKW
its listing mp4 files under advanced stats for the strm
so settings -> advanced -> show stats where ya can also see latency and whatnot
hell - they could enforce a "post ad reload"
rather then trying so hard to let it just continue in the background while something else is overlaying
cus desync or flatout muting of the stream cus an ad played is rly not a good user experience
lemme guess - they were hoping to get a 10yr senior
I aint ever gonna have an understanding towards the decision to only search for masters upwards senioss
like - as if everyone comes out of highschool with a masters in exactly what you want, having breathed the field of expertise since kindergarden
showing the eagerness to learn should be prime positive
especially given that UI handling last I recall is heaps easier
compared to writing a videoplayer WITH dynamic UI elements
like - correct me if I am lookin at this silly like, but "just UI" is silly
and lookin at the BotW UI system they used in TotK and Echoes? that thing's got some GLARING issues
never had a digital TCG lock up on my so much
well... fingers crossed it isnt gonna look like that for me - given the details I outlined in dms and all
also I DESPISE the avatars man I would prefer nothing KEKW
cus like - imagine just having the money to get all the hardware needed to mess with in private
or better yet just give us 8bit trainers like the games or something
not these grubhub commercial ass avatars
like in OoT to the fire side of things KEKW
where it DOES NOT tell you that
that is such a troll nintendo fuck you KEKW
dinner time gl on rest of run
why is zora armor more optimal over green tunic?
ah so its just the menuing timesave
so an entire open and close menu which otherwise would be attached
god am I happy rn to have the old thermo layer of my old jacket still
freezing temps outside and the heater by what I can gauge is turned off
like - not my room but entirew building
Mario paint was good and then I did like 3hrs of MM practice butter15Smile
is sub 6 considered good for this run
That's why my goal is sub 5:50 lol
I'm honestly surprised more people haven't ran TP Glitchless, I know its quite long but something like TTYD had tons of people running Any% back in the day when it was like 6 hours long
I gotta run to the store before it becomes too late so I'mma go do that
Hope the run is good in the meantime though <3
I wonder how Wii leaderboards are for glitchless
Which version do you think is more fun to run, wii or gc?
i thought we saved this dude in MM why he still trying to kill us Madge
but is he tryin to kill us or test us
OOOOR is it just another silly skullkid scheme
look a dark, orange ornamented crystal!
interesting that the roundabout walk is quicker then swimming to me
gotta have the hero in green, cant have that be blue which is silly
gonna try for some more sleep
its too cold and I cant always keep awake in local morning
need to actually shift that somehow
as much as its shit w current "warmth"
Yo Phantom gl on the run today!
I wanna pet the Link wolf
Just the best thousand yr doorer
haven't seen a glitch run in a bit only did some gltiched speedrun of the wiiu version
it's kinda funny how the glitches are almost identical despite them trying to patch it
those two glitches save so much on sd compared to hd
just helps it get started faster
ghunzoLove thepri67Love rhacodLove AmbessaLove tippiLove laserg8Heart phanto274Heart
he dodge the tip of your sword this time
You can actually just aim the camera up after getting the rod and hit it through the floor
still faster than waiting for night
why must you make midna say "what is it, daddy?"
Why are there so many ass shots of midna in this game
Is that the bridge of elden
it's the smashy stage from the game you can trip and slip in
Of all places in TP why a random bridge
Something not right abt midna saying "What is it daddy"
that's a hell of a sentence to come into
"Who are you.......Daddy? You sure thats right?"
Daddy do not show her your rod
I am not looking down there
Phantom thanks I am playing "casually" and not have done in many years. Was looking for the last howling stone and I forgot there was one in Kak
There were a few dungeons I got lost LOL cause I have not done casually in a very long time
time for my least favorite dungeon, appearance really cool; gameplay... uhggg
the first time playing it got lost on one of the sides for hours
I remember some runners doing that without boots
Sorry about all the typos, my keyboard is starting to fail

I get to make her play minish cap now LUL
i will GLADLY take minish cap over ever touching another rhythm heaven game
btw phantom, Banjo 4.2 just dropped
Signposts can now contain AP Hints. Signposts can also be Checks... Signsanity!!
You mean getting to the boss key reverse order?
which i didnt even know was possible
I could never get that consistent though
but i bugged out the menus
and couldnt select anything, including exit menu
If I ever run glitchless TP again I will look more into it
i was 20 minutes ahead of PB
oh, if you turn everything on its now at 1018 checks
Ya, the rang LJA is pretty free
You in about 3 minutes LOL
How vulgar / none PC are we allowed to be in your filename redeems?
Just vulgar and funny, like Daddy LMAO
i am not a bot. i am just like you, the other chatters. haha
how's the run been, been away for a bit
“Can you enter Zant quickly” ayo
dont you hate it when youre fighting for your life and you get ten dollars
uhm actually nerdCheck that's a BIG key
i was looking for an emote to make that exact message arie OMEGALUL
you jumped off a cliff and walked in through a different door
you get even more free time save after sword of light
i think he just says "you"
phanto274Pacepal Phantom on pace? LETS GO!
Barrier was not there I do not think, Kargarok hit you
that fight always makes me laugh. like hes finally sick of getting his ass beat he just goes "enough"
hmm i wonder who you will raid tonight Kappa
I think City and Palace, do a couple of ILs and you will pb and sub 6 in no time.
I think you are doing quite well
thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Oh phantom did you change your Oengus password
Yeah I log in with twitch myself
Let Phantom5800 know you want to drop in and collaborate!
The new boba fruit teas are really good
There's a blueberry lemonade one now
blueberry lemonade is just fuckin good
If you get a chance to try the Cherry Blossom one
I am loving this tp grind
yeah not really hard to make lemonade
Idk all of their Boba Fruit teas are incredibly good
how much did you order last time holy shit
They saw the filename and were like "gotta dip"
"Your package was shipped on 2/5!" why the fuck are you using past tense, it's the fourth
Damn if this was echoes of wisdom you would of lost like 12 seconds to rupee cutscenes
sweet christ i'm gonna be ahead of you and monado within a literal minute, neither of you do that
did you know if you herd 21/20 goats you get fucked in the ass by a dommy mommy
@TheGlubbers damn i gotta start tp speedruns soon then
Yo morph gl getting fucked in the ass
Yo ty glubbers for the gl in getting fucked in the ass
This cutscene is longer than Echoes of Wisdom any% U
its almost like you could do a roll by performing 2 180s and save minor time demNerd
Mr Phantom why did you reduce your height for any%
This is what Lan does when he's not virus busting
Just beats the shit out of training dummies
no but i do know how to do a quickspin
quickspins cant be preformed by a human
nono feli you see, i was named explicitly in that song so i can
You don't wanna grab the cock?
just like i love golden rods
fuck yeah those pipes are so tight GaySex
Well guess I'm getting a head start
fair enough i don't care about this job
Yo stravos! Things are good here, just a little sick
I would unironically do a race this week if you wanted
I don't even own this game
I'm sure you got your legal copy on hand
I don't even have a modded console to get this game legally
Your PC probably has a modded console on it
The day I ever play on emulator
dont know what ur on about
I am WAY too sensitive to input lag
Pretty sure you can midna jump from the ground there too
@Monado it's the reverse with that one, you don't midna jump from the ground, you can make the jump without midna jumps
yeah the midna jump up to the house at first?
however i do bother doing 2 180 degree turns into a quick roll input
Nah Phantom fell off the platform after scaring the guy into the water and I'm pretty sure if you fall you can active midna from the ground
That's what I was referring to
he uses splits as route docs
have you seen him run super metroid 100%
you can autosplit for TP, it's just kinda complicated to set up
i imagine you'd just autosplit for item pickup textboxes no
that's what marco does, textboxes seem consistent
yeah item pickup textboxes is what people have done in the past
This is why I use a split pedal
i run TP and EoW. the answer to that is just yes.
I'm just gonna speed it through
is there a chance of reset else i can redeem another banger
Ask morph if he's ok with it
cant you push the monkey to speed it up?
Yeah that's why generally you don't wanna do it, it's just time loss if it's too far
Your new line better be "LETS REV IT UP!'
I was gonna say what did the hero's shade ever do, bad comparison
Beats me, my brain is weird
apperently i got a giftsub popesSmash
That fucking subathon is taking longer than I thought it would
Did you activate polymerization to fuse that shadow?
Or is it more contact fusion?
Contact fusion isn't even a thing, it's anime bullshit
Yeah but it's special summon not contact fusion
Contact fusion is a widely recognized fan term for "Open state special summon fusion monster"
At least in season 4 they fixed that
The one fucking season that only aired in Japan
the final ep of 5ds is so good
The censored ones are worth it
Because what's better than revving it up?
Something I never got is why yusei is just that stale all throughout the series
He never goes through something like yugi or jaden
I mean. He only had to deal with the trama of knowing his dad exploded himself and then the guy who adopted Jack and his brother forced it to happen
I watched it, meh, felt like rewritten digital monsters
Yeah zeli but he didn't fucking die at some point
Did you not watch the show?
If you're counting at the end that shit doesn't count
I need to remember where it was
When he falls into the Ener D reactor with Roman after their duel and he sees his dad's spirit
Right before they all duel double signer rex
It's also been like 8 years
It is heavily stated he was sent to the netherworld. But his dad's spirit helps him not get caught by the dread
I've never watched any yugioh so I have no clue what any of those words mean.
Wouldn't surprise considering rex wanted to kill everyone
And then he came back to life as to not abandon his card game motorcycle
I'm still mad 4 kids didn't air when Jack had his dragon upgraded
It has a massive jump between episodes in 4kids
It's not as visible because I think time line reset or some shit? I don't recall
Mr Phantom would you consider getting taller?
Ok. Well thank you for your consideration in considering it
@theglubbers come here fucker I'm gonna make you an NBA baller
Oh you said milk, I heard smoke
But to be fair the chief does look like he'd smoke Marlboro
Or slap my tits and call me Cindy that works
What’s the WR for this category?
Reminds me of old hundo days
I thought DF was in there somewhere.
It used to be like a 10 min and then 20 min difference
Hey Phantom, IIRC at one time he was first.
Tbh I've never cared for glitchless for the same contradiction in tech for what could and couldn't be considered a glitch
i fell off so many times the fairy revived me on the bridge and i still game overed
its probably not 100% but im only one stamp and cave of shadows away from full completion
yeah when i think of 100 now i think of like randomizer 100
when i did mine we slapped each other at the same time, if you mash fast enough you can still push him i think
Fire in a wooden shield, doesn't burn
wow BNLC has already sold 1.6 million. that's big
i was shocked at how short hyrule castle is but i guess part of it is also like earlier carrying midna
Yo gl on the run Phantom!
Yeah hyrule is included for MDH
But also lakebed is long as shit
Mr Phantom. What are you doing outside of Temple of the Ocean King and Tower of Spirits?
Guess who suggested it and then they timed it
Swift is less than this guy
Zeli go shove your comment up your ass
You can write it on a piece of paper and then all in
I don't have a piece of paper
that was the coolest switch tech ive ever seen
Don't tell me there's a pot push here too
I did not even know pot jump was a think LOL
Every single zelda I've seen or tried to run has a strat including a pot I swear
Would it be worth it to just kill the bublins?
if theres more than two enemies on screen, targeting is impossible
i feel like targeting in this game is worse than oot
I feel it better than oot, oot and mm are trash at targeting
it needs to really take into account where the camera is facing
but also, during the ganon fight its useful for it to not do that
ganon is the only time you ever need to target behind
I used to run the JP glitchless too, once I started getting better the game became so frustrating.
Did you know you do not need to shoot the rope?
Ya, dont worry about 3 seconds until you need to worry about it
Either way, it is good to see you getting better all the time.
ya, in glitchless categories it is all about consistent movement.
I hate oot glitchless because it's all ess turns
I get it's comsistent but without the adapter it's just trash
Zeldamon: Gale Boomerang of Darkness TP
Yeah it's pretty much oot to blame for allowing adapters
I mean if it's mini I'm not surprised
But still Jesus allowing the adapter
Is there a deadzone / ESS limit for the adapters?
Well they had to add no changing values mid run
Because yes some changed their  values
Well unbuffered and I'm guessing keeping the speed
I wonder if they see normal bokos or the twilight one
@swiftpichu_ Yeah I’m with you on that lol
I am almost done with my 3 heart randomizer seed. Not 3 hearts by choice, though. This seed was… Something, alright.
I chose the setting that purges everything ‘unnecessary’ from every dungeon check. And somehow I still had to do nearly every single check to get the butter sword.
I didn’t think hearts were ‘unnecessary’.
@zeliversal if you share with me
I will share a singular dollar with you in 20 years
i just realized i don't think i ever paused the game as wolf link
Can anyone here glaze my waffles?
your friend wants someone to glaze your waffles?
why is your friend so caring
Oh right you guys don't know me, hi, I'm a fucking pig
shouldn't your friend just glaze your waffles then?'
if they care so much about it
The same way Epona can hear the ocarina in OoT/MM
horses can hear from about 2.78 miles away
rabbits are a little less at 2 miles
rabbits have a wider hearing range than horses
its weird because you'd think rabbits can hear farther away because their ears are like satellite dishes
I wasnt watching, but dont you just hit A once and pull bow and its line up perfect?
Is the main difference is you can S&Q in Glitchless, but not JP?
Or are there specific tricks for each category
AHH even the spinner one in Snowpeak?
Ill have to stay tuned :)
I think it would be cool to see a glitchless run that combines the fast stuff allowed between both categories
When I was running we had to do a bomb boost
yeah that 100% a glitch KEKW
I dont think bomb boost are a glitch, but if you want to run a category you play by that ruleset.
THat makes sense, except for the last one before the last darknut by the final bosses
The first 2 I dont think are glitches, you are going around them not actually skipping them
it was more curious, just too lazy to look it up even though it takes longer to ask you and chat questions instead :) Interraction
Never owned a wii u, and I dont care for remakes.
Unless its a remake with new good content
I could get it for CEMU I suppose
in hd though overall you might get less rupees because of stamps
@TomaThePolliwog Its funny you mention that, because I feel like due to TP forcing you to put rupees back if you can't hold them in SD will cause you to lose more
OH Lakebed without the boost to toad,
this should be good to see too
Cause nobody will be coming back to a dungeon just for a rupee chest
I actually like a lot of what lakebed does in glitchless
Skips enough and feels good to do right
Definitely worth the little time to set up
This is normal, the backup if you miss the damage boost from the reverse side.
or if a person sucks at the bomb boost off of the chest they always do it this way
its 7th red flash, and you get 2 frames
For me, worst part about glitchless runs is not bonking
Knowing when to roll and when to not
especially when rolling toward doors "can I roll 1 more time"
TBH I am most interested in snowpeak, becuase most of this is the same if you do not do the chest bomb boost
Watching you makes me wants to start practicing again
So you gotta go through the turning room?
Spike room is both, but the elevator turning we dont see.
i missed a heart container here and had to go back and i wanted to die
Back in the day, we timed it to actually swim through again then S&Q
yeah piece. it was in a side tunnel where water flows you have to use iron boots
Depending where you place the stairs
It was not by much though, <1 second
Well Adam tested it, and I trusthim
Ya, I have been liking watching you this last week and our interraction
nice rhone welcome to our ghostly pack
the only way they could have made this game better for me is if they had a vaati fight in like a mirror room
and if they changed the ending
Thinking of filename for next run Kappa
because whenever you get these artifacts theres always a lot of like wind swirling around
So far except for Save and Quit, the run is really similar
since JP I think allows damage boost for Dom Rod
hardest part of no save and quit having the aeroflos kill u through the fence gate to get the klaw
@RhoneRanger2001 no u cant it kills run if u do it glitchless
Same. Like yesterday for double claw you sucked at it, but for key in castle you did it perfect.
@stavros12c34anenoglou True, that is why I said do it right LOL
Mr Phantom. I have a max revive for your Midna. I shipped it directly to Zelda for easy pickup
I hope you find this acceptable
DUDE I did that yesterday, that exact thing I was so mat
yep Zeli, i walked away cause I was that angry
These puppets have always freaked me out, for 30 + years, no necks and their heads just spin
Not sure if you knew, but if you shoot the watchtower dude first, they will not send the rest after you
you can skip this too if you hit him before the CS
To be honest, we had no SnQ when I ran, so it was usually night
ok, excited to see Arbiters now without the tricks.
I just know if you kill the watch tower dude first, he cant warn the others
Its not too precise, if you struggle can always switch to wolf
So the main changes are after the 4 poes?
Because so far its the same
There is an arrow drop in Arbiters I always get
but that might be only in JP
BTW DS Skip I believe is allowed, becasue it is an enemy LJA right?
dont need to move the elevator at all
Ya, in JP never saw these rooms
This room JP does, but in revers order
So not huge difference, but because of no BK early makes it somewhat easier
You should watch what I do here
I'll do 3 stabs, step back slightly, then repeat
Even if some slashes don't connect/do damage it still keeps him stunned
Time slashes so you do not do the 4th mega hit, and you can do it
that might help me if I go back to this
I assume if you get there on the first cycle?
Ya, I just hate that area so much
SO arbiters is a little different but not much, stallord is the same
Snowpeak I am curious to see
Its fine, but can you at least show me snowpeak differences if you decide to reset?
I think you'll still be ahead, or barely not
ya, I dont care to much about ToT, that is about the same
I want to see Snowpeack and how ENG glitchless does it
Phantom your streams have been keeping me sane so thank you ukyotpPray
Is where those things move random?
My car didn’t start this morning -36
I had to walk in then my coworker drove me home KEKW
How is speedrunning tp anyways? Been considering learning a category in it at some point
Dilly, find a game you raelly like
It’s only a 15 minute walk tbf lol
Like Paper Mario is an ez game and WR is free Kappa
@RhoneRanger2001 There are a lot of those lmao, on the rope between tp, majora and oot
I mean, if you like OOT
but then just play the game casually a few times and get to know the game first.
Well Majora all fairy rewards is most enticing, cause I just really like fairies
Okay, so do it casually first
until you are able to get all the fairy rewards
Then learn the simple things, like superslides, weirdshots and boosts
Just do what you want, but it is mandatory to know where things are.
So first just play a few times with my current knowledge then?
make sure you know where the fairies are at
Taking notes on the cave movement
Then start learning tricks on or 2 at a time
At least that is my advise, you need to know where they are before you know and understand how to get them faster.
Yeah mainly to do that and avoid the keese
Okay, so Phantom, you said snowhead is quite different than jp?
SIMPLE tip, to save .5 seconds, if there are double doors go to the Right door to open
Ya like that see? saves link from sliding over
Phantom, in JP glitchless we get no soup ingredients
So ya, this is way different
JP uses spinner boost to the other side, then fire this cannon
Back when I ran we did not do LFC, we did Iron Boots bomb boost
Which I am not sure, but I think may be faster?
Phantom are we racing AD this weekend phanto274Mash
Ya, snowpeak is very different from what I remember. But it is very cool to see.
My only run was 5:12 so far lol
I lost more time to dangoro and not picking up the dominion rod than I did to any major tricks KEKW
so its a 4 person battle next month?
Bro was looking like “whatcha doin on the ladder”
Ya, this is quite a bit different, but still quite fun, unless you die to Blizetta..
If you want to stop, I understand
this run has been sad for many reasons but that one was the saddest
But its cool to see how different it is
i can only wish better luck next time
I assume City and Palace  and Castle are about the same?
THat is only a jump off the side during Argorok
Ithought you meant during the fight
heard the run's takin a bit of a nosedive, still hope you're well PrideFlower runs cookin some decent bits here'n there
I’m heading to Bedge good luck with the Glodders chicken
here's fingers crossed for a "normal" armogohma given RNG then
and not a perfect RNG one KEKW
cus that would suck BALLS for future runs
you got a double via the JA again
the hitbox of MS seems to be MASSIVE behind link
literally hit like half a link behind him
cus lining up 3 of them is harsh yea
that one helmasaur helmet too close monkaW
There should be pots in here
lrighty then solid go at it today
They hit.  Got hit with 2 as I waddled in then a group of 8 haha
Hey Phan...can I have a favor?
always room for a thats never happened before moment
Probably just...words of encouragement to continue?
I mean if I cut off my foot then yeah it should pass
Hey that was the goat that responds late to whoops
That i could make about link being wet lumbeaRhmm
you should already be fighting ganon at this point come on
Wrong warp from ordon to the final battle.
don't tell that to UNDERTALE fans
Guess Goats on the menu boys
The poor goats. They just didn't feel like inning today
You kind of just wait for them to be in a line and foward b attack without targeting
Hallo! Good luck on the run!
I get a DM on my etsy
“can you please make me a new one”
@Allegrenix i visited etsy today and came acroos egyptian god slimes where its the ra and slifer version. Majorly epic.
So I go, maybe they’ve bought from me before and are wanting a replacement
Nope, they’ve never bought from me
“What do you mean, make you a new one? A new one what?”
Next day I get a reply
Just try and guess what they said
And no cheating and looking at my bluesky where I posted the conversation
today back in 2001 paper mario was release didn't need another reminding that i am old Deadge
I mean I’m fine with making new characters
In fact I like that more
I like kok please give me kok
damn not even a hi 1st Sadge
I'm gonna go have an enema
Fuck off I had a shiny in quote form
Fuck it really was a shiny
Wouldn't that be your standard boko?
These are just in their goth phase
I did prove it is possible though
Are the moves he does here random, or is there a way to predict if he'll slap or not?
And thank you for the expo of why iron boots splits suck ass
But hey you still got your dignity
So is tp considered one of the harder runs, because it's longer, or are the tricks also harder to perform?
I see, what I'm struggling with in majora right now is consistently performing easier tricks that require quick button presses like bomb hovering. Anything similar in this game?
Slapping a goron nipple mst be paintful, considering you're basically slapping a rock
Hello mister Link. I am a Midna hanging onto your shadow. Every time you roll, my grip loosens. I am about to fall off. Please stop. Thank You.
who up mountin' they horse from behind modCheck
i need to figure out what to get for dinner
I still have never done a complete run of any Zelda game lol
I’ve tried alttp, wind waker, oot, and mm lol
phantom, found a game for you to run multiworld in
and every time I went “eh I don’t like it” lol
"thats okay" so youre fine with it? cool beans!
so would you wait for beta then?
last night I did a banjo seed with the new update. win con 6 out of 8 bosses. I hade to hint my chain for the 6th boss and it took my 7.5 hours. Im still new tho and want to learn the game.
when i watch people run those settings in multi world it takes them around 3 hours
probably one of the worst parts of this game ngl
i hate pretty much all of the twilight sections except for the very first time you wake up as a wolf and i think this is the worst one
And thats why in the HD version they made it less ass
magic hand comes out to poke the bug to death lol
Yo Phantom, GL with the speedrun
Mario the red Link I think
@Luey_Gaming_Guy oh from four swords i gotchu
I bet that's caused some heated discussion in the uma musume community
wait that is a great comment
don't worry i have already taped my eyes shut
I'll come back to you on that when I reach that part on my current playthrough
Gotta say though, replaying all the Zelda games I remember from my childhood reminds me just how simple the puzzles I struggled with as a kid actually were
Even the bug hunting sections aren't as bad as I remember
cheer100 You almost got you access it automatically? Since I was practicing stuff for casual play of that long ago and it becomes a magic meter, right?
outing is done and nice solid start. Cooking and Lurking
gotta go clean this eel’s teeth
Is Jerry a name the community gave him, or just something you came up with?
Well I bet that tektite that interrupted your trick is named Marvin
no, I can't remember ever having trouble with the tektites
No no. How do you classify this as gaming?
This is all just a figment of Midna's mind control
We arent expressing free will. We are just doing the run as she wants us to
And by we. I mean you.
And by you. I mean her
Midna's the best companion for a reason
MIDNA is pressing buttons and wolf link is running
@Zeliversal But how is Midna pressing buttons, when this is the section where she's dying
She's dying because Link was too slow
And the run was too slow
She's panting because she's pressing buttons faster
Time to add the 7tv emote
Besides, who needs emotes from a retired streamer
Well, I seemed to have lost track of time and unfortunately still need to sleep tonight. Good luck with the rest of the run!
Also appreciate you answering the questions I had today
I don't know how to tell you this @amishman19
You look at emotes, not listen to them
Listen, I hear with my ears
I can’t believe I typo’d when I was trying to use eyes
I half believe my autocorrect changed it when I looked away
I think you need to just admit you're wrong
Listen Zeli, I’ll admit I’m wrong when my eyes start listening
I feel like TP has one of the best stories to enjoy casually, what is your opinion on it?
is that a quality of life boar? is there a slider for that?
omg it is a QOL boar phanto274ColonD
Ok we're gonna review this again
It's okay. Everyone makes mistakes. Just study.
That enemy is such a gentleman, just kindly waiting for you to pull the chain
I meant to ask earlier, the guy who turned into gold, do you ever see him again in 100%?
@monado it’s been yeah, you’re right
heyo, how goes Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess?
We were playing that Remake of Silent hill 2
It's been a lot of fun~
that's gonna be great if you can do it- Good luck!
cooking be done and i missed BonyBoy
did you practice before this run Susge
Oh fuck yeah Morph too? LETSGO
Thank you again for the help earlier Phantom, which json I’m I exporting to remove the horizontal bit from? I feel like I haven’t found the right one yet
that’s no big deal, I’ll poke around and ask again later when you’re not in the middle of a run if I can’t find it phanto274Smile
Did he clank on your shield somehow
Best dungeon time Lets rock this phantom
is this the slash over the fence room?
Okay no I was getting my rooms mixed up
Are you on PB pace PauseChamp
I don’t think I’ve seen a 100% run, I’ll have to tune in when you do it phanto274Smile
im not arachnophobic but this is the worst fight in the game because the gimmick is dumb
the dragon isnt that fun either. as a casual fight its just hectic and if you fall you lose 2 minutes to getting back up there
oh right the nice carriage lady
That’s the only reason I remember her phanto274Smile
Mr Phantom you're making the people cry because they're so happy to have a puppy running around time
i've been playing ff7 rebirth between practice/runs and honestly the overworld bloat is wild to me
i like the rest of the game a lot at least
i do appreciate how much unique dialogue there is
but god damn is there a fuck ton
ff7 the best character and world building ever
not a lot cuz im not huge on card games
but i can see the appeal from the forced parts i had to play
oh is there a storyline behind it
i got my ass beat by wize the robot on the way to costa del sol which was pretty funny
i was his first victory OMEGALUL
i'll prob mess with it more then, didn't know it ran deep
i just thought it was another triple triad/blitzball/etc.
I just finished a semi-casual playthrough of TP to re-learn the game
Ya, got lost a couple times like I mentioned last night.
i just finished going through costa del sol with the hojo fight at the end
iirc should be golden saucer iirc, been a while
gl on the last bit of the run PrideFlower
funky kinda how the wooden shield is just the shield to to through the run with PrideFlower like - yea, hylian shield doesnt add shit, still looks silly
I thought there was a chest somewhere, maybe in Castle that has a chest with Hylian shield?
all the reasons you could have for it end at bomb arrows as well
in castle town a goron shop I think, for like 200
but dont recall if wooden or hylian
plus you could never lose hylian even if you wanted post getting it
so who would ever buy the metal plate there
Goodness i love this fight so much!
I think this is the worst room in the game to do well
Ya, and the fans go SO slow, so if you miss the shot there is 30-45 seconds
basically: double clawshot is a fun idea. it being hugely tied to forced waiting is kinda sad
yus MAN you could do cool things with this concept both for traversal and for combat
turn them into whip style 2hand grabbies
but all the big, fun ideas to that end sadly seem to have mellowed out towards the ball & chain in the end, given spinner AND double clawshot are in that "they are cool, BUT - "area
Damn it, I forgot to give my peahats rain umbrellas again Madge
if ya could clawshot into rocks for climbing instead of targets only, that woulda been grand
we LOVE animations blocking pause menu interactions 🙃
still no understanding why that specifically was brought into this game after we did not need it in mario either
the zant heads usually drop some no?
yeah i remember all the pots being empty
if only the forbidden scripts of rando would have reached all pots already 😅
past just what ppl have manually dug out I mean
kinda hilarious come to think how little the requirements would be if the PoT warp would be open items wise
like - clawshot, wolf for the items mostly
and then zant having the boatload of requirements for the fight
"I cant fight zant for heart container, I still need <pick between boomerang, iron boots, zora armor, ball&chain and swords"
hilarious come to think how little puzzle related use the bow has in this game
i blame miyamoto for having like four different spider enemies in this game
I ran my dishwasher at 8 and it’s still not done. getting close to quiet hours I didn’t realize how long a dishwasher runs KEKW
skullwalltulas, big and medium skulltulas are the 3 I can think of for spiders
theres also the crablike ones in the water temple
It’s not crazy loud but I’m worried people will complain lol
usually a dishwasher program goes for like 2 hours, also if its that loud how did ya stack your stuff PrideLaugh
nah dishwasher no one should complain
if you were to wash your clothes and it goes into the last 10 minutes, maybe
otherwise you'd have to be worried about a fridge
Okay that’s true I’m probably overthinking it KEKW
and WHO would complain about you preserving your food
like - what would make a difference is if you were manually doin the dishes super loudly and even THAT to my understanding if you're not doing it for longer then say, 5m imo should be fine
think "whoops, a glass or similar fell, need to clean the newly created hazard"
have seen it too much when I did retrocheevos for this game
always the same mask he comes out of here?
Okay as I was talking about it the dishwasher shut off… that thing is sentient
@Midnaliin usual dishwasher programs I know of are 90m to (if intensive) 2h
though the manual of your dishwasher will have more info on which programs take how long
dishwashers are only useful if they can use clippy boots can I get a poggers chat
I'm just trying to copy your bot
ive always wondered how the mailman knows wolf link is link
the HyruleanPostalService needs to know where their inhabitants are at, with all the stuff going on
what surprises me more is tha the Mailman is capable of traversing twili like no other being
or maybe she has a tumor
OOOR its just cus small body humanoid characters are harder ish to make proper heads for given babies usually have kinda weird proportions there
I feel really unhinged right now so I'm just being very careful at the moment PrideUnicorn
and no, I'm not high LMAO
although an edible sounds good atm
I see someone has the good pride emotes PrideUwu
I do think I have them all, there were 25 ye?
PrideShrug PrideFloat PridePog PrideCute PrideLaugh PrideUwu PrideRhino PrideLGBTea PrideToucan PrideDragon PrideUnicorn PrideWave PridePenguin PrideFlower PrideLion PrideHeartR PrideHeartL PrideRise PrideStrong PrideLove PrideHeyyy PrideKoala PrideCrown PrideWorld PridePaint
those are all the ones you coulda earned back in like 2020?
PrideShrug PrideFloat PridePog PrideCute PrideLaugh PrideUwu PrideRhino PrideHeyyy PrideLGBTea PrideToucan PrideDragon PrideUnicorn PrideWave PridePenguin PrideFlower PrideLion PrideHeartL PrideHeartR PrideStrong PrideLove PrideKoala PrideWorld PridePaint PrideCrown PrideRise
yea it was 2020 or 2019 or some such
one of the last times an event like that was done to my knowledge
also hyperscape based emotes which I know came after
then hindsight 2020 got a set
which that last one I dont know if it was also distributed in the same way as pride emotes
but nothing like that been happening since around 2020 rly
lots boilin down towards more "watch this NOW to get emote"
and then the weird streamtogether event thing they did last year christmas roundabout which.... yea.... no.....
I legit don't remember that PrideLaugh
@OhHeyItJaye tldr: look at this one and you will understand quickly why there's been goingons about that last one I mentioned: CatintheChat
how cool would it have been if they had a separate four player adventure mode where you play as the telma friends storming hyrule castle
this split is now hell KEKW
so close to sub 6 SoB
I randomly got recommended a video from the VGBootCamp channel so I decided to take a look out of curiosity and most of their vods now don't even crack 500 views
I have never seen an esports org cook themselves harder
that makes sense then why I dont have any clue who or what that is lmao
never was big in watching esports type shit
when i played the horse segment zelda couldn't aim for shit
its all eponas fault in the end
zelda just sits straight angle atop of epona
so you gotta tail dorf flat, otherwise ya get trolled
that zelda split could also still improve if you get quicker dives out of her, ye?
i still don't understand how everyone gets revived
but thats like maybe 2s or somesuch?
I go get a snack for 2 minutes LMAO
I love the way link runs in Zora armor
Not tagging along with buff00n but maybe in July
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Awsm finish out! Great job on the PB! Hope u have a wonderful rest of day/night
if it’s anything like storm, he’s gonna get buffed and be broken
I saw splash make a girl crash out and take drugs in a video game
wtf's Splash doing to women ?
This town ain't big enough for TWO png tubers
to be revealed soon or whenever zach is not asleep to watch the test stream
I tried the DKC Returns Demo
they started me with 74 lives
Raven streams the day they announce Wario Land 4? Crazy
They're adding Suicune to Pokémon Unite
Hd randomizer At 9am let's go chroma149MRFAIRY
Are you in the HD randomizer discord?
So I assume mashing swift sail is faster than regular swift sail
On version 1.1.0 we have many many QoL improvements, for example, quite swift sail
Also it's theoretically possible to get an unbeatable seed when playing with charts due to a bug
Also Also, we have a weekly community race seed if you Wanna join
It's super casual, also it's async so everyone can play at their own time
Got a whole audience with that chest
Just run up a wall like a goat you do you link
So how does supersonic grapple hook go zoom mode work
Don't worry I don't math either
why are people saying Mai looks like a man in SF6, what do I have to do to look like her
I think I need to kill Andy Bogard
@Phantom5800 I've been saying for years now that Geese Howard looks like a woman
Molgera what do you think of this matter
your triforce piece is in botw? good luck
I see you're playing wind waker btw, you should try the wind waker rando
botw and totk in archipelago with koroks on
Randomizer but one of the items is in a completely different game
And tell him to give us Luka back please we haven't won a game in 3 weeks
these great fairies suck, they have 4 arms and no tits
at least the TP great fairies bottle their tears for you
What's stopping me from growing wings and flying for 12 seconds
person that raided morph said they died in City in their TPHD run so I went to look. They didn't clawshot high enough and Argorok hit them with fire
they just didn't get high enough on the pillar and needed 3 clawshots before peahat could be targeted
I don't know what emote to use
That's something pallos would say to me
maybe if you had an ess adapter like sd
botw and totk actually ban having notches on your controller
he's playing ttyd and is about to talk to flurrie
the great tree's hole is block and flurrie needs to blow it open
pope just pressed the everything button for the new people
beest's wooden statue split icon has TOS plastered over the tip
i have been so hyper fixated on super mario sluggers bc matt is a part of a draft league with his friends where the cpus control everything
matt and I watched a game that went into the 12th inning and ended in a tie
the actual league games are played tn so we'll see if the same thing happens for real though
tbh one of the teams that was a part of that game is currently 0-3 so they probably want a big blowout to have a chance
you can't do that puzzle with grapple or bow right?
we're milking hylians in this stream?
matt got me with the if you read this you're gay last night and i just saw it now
this feels so wrong without the toad mod
@Phantom5800 i'm gonna pretend like i never saw that
yo plant ty for the gl
yo morp ty for the gl
the devs deserve some bouncing on it for that tbh
okay im finished eating now, my shitposting powers are unleashed again
i love that ice arrows are actually good in this game
forbidden tingle statue is a crazy name
what's wrong with a sticky tingle statue
the thought of someone beating it off to tingle is terrifying
finally immortalized and it only took talking about a sticky tingle statue
I don't even remember saying that
i love the atmosphere of this fight but otherwise it sucks
this one cycle looks so hard
Are you on 1.1 yet rickyLUL
it's just crasher wake at that point
i don't want to move either
TIL light arrows can stun you too
i won't say hi to the other site
6 more days for daybreak 2 HYPERCLAP
YEP everything getting drop for that game
what if you had to find the boat
grandma just gives you a boat
Now this is a Glitchless Any% closing in on sub 6 The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess stream I can get behind phanto274Smile
Remember when this song was our ... 😳
the paper that leads to the cheese rock
todays not your day for goats
damn they have really big foreheads
phantom im at 43k out of 50k  so soooonnnn
soooon u get a dumb minish rando seed
If you happen to fall off the platform there you use midna from the ground to jump onto the water wheel into the house
aww carnt annoy monado today then
@Archimedesbones Oh great, bean man is here
@Monado p4 righht now no balls
What if Zelda... was a girl?!
What if Zelda... stopped putting bad items into games, like the top in this one, or the telescope in Wind Waker?
idk what you code in, but for the past 2 years ive been using go and i just discovered vlang and every page of documentation I read I'm mindblown
thats fair. my brain isn't big enough for c/c++
Your brain is bigger than mine. I can’t even make a livesplit properly KEKW
so sub 6 is definitely possible
Yeah lol I still dont fully understand it but they are separated now
Wait you do? I didn’t know that lol
Monkey is just a scaredy cat
Gotta call spider man for that spider
Didn't know you could jump from there with the spider walking
you need a monkey clap sound effect redeem wheres hes just upside down
Quick spins are good again so far
you can multitarget above the door to make the door rise
i think most things in this game you can only target once. but the door is an exception afaik
I guess the boss you can too
Link is throwing for content :(
i did it on wii u but idk if its on gc
i was trying to time that appropriately lol
How runs going ? Gl for runs
Nice to see another Zelda game besides OoT and MM
Are people not playing LttP anymore?
have you ever tried the uh. what was it. the fangame that turns LttP into a procedural roguelike
i still want to beat four swords on gamecube
I still wanna try out the oracle games
My dishwasher didn’t clean my dishes NOPERS
@AnniLyn2 love both the oracle games
Gonna have to hire phantom to wash my dishes now
does your dishwasher have a 'Tough" option
@midnaliin check for mold first lolz
no way 70 cents usd a hour
is there a holiday bonus for extra plates beyond the average
yeah burned pots is going to be an upcharge
No but I’ll feed you pop tarts NODDERS
I got 99 questions but they make no sense
Chocolate cuz the strawberry ones are gross lol
Just z target over and over until the bug comes to you
"No fire. Caution" proceeds to have fire in there already
Not an opinion just a fact KEKW
what was there was really good but i was left at the end kind of like "that was it?"
So imagine. Epona didn't show up... how the fuck do I go back to ordon with the gate there
Barnes don't got bombs yet and they don't have keys
Probably...throw him over the gate xD
Well no gorons had to help because of his bomb lab exploding
Not gonna say who blew it up but..
he intentionally stepped out of the ring
Not bad enough to start all over
if he restarts he can test the multi target dungeon door though
gl on run at movies 🎥
@AnniLyn2 in the room after you get the boomerang? on wii u you can multi target it to open the door all the way instead of opening it a little at a time
I've tried that before... it never worked :/
which bokoblin has the damn flute?? he's dying first
But...only half?? How did you die
jump off the watchtower and die
No no keep doing glitched...practice makes perfect
is the decision to make something a glitch determined solely on occurrence frequency
Put the rock to the right of the pink flower trust
like just right of it or on it
Eh this is the more important category anyway.
No it's fine...I've been exhausted all day today
yo congrats on the sub 6!
I saw you in eldin twilight as human... what were you doing...
Gonna dip out here but good luck on JOTWAD NODDERS
you can start it you just can't finish it :P
i'm doing a game for the RA Challenge League right now and my god it's been like 10 minutes of talking with no way to skip dialogue cause it's all voice acted lol
for a sega saturn game it's not BAD voice acting. there's just so much exposition at the start lol
nah i said it wasn't bad lol
all i know is that trick isn't possible on wii u because of an invisible wall
my headcannon is that EMS was patched because it could happen accidentally to a casual player
otherwise they would have also fixed boomerang lja
I think a random player could technically get on the ledge by mistake
I mean a lot of big glitches are discovered on accident tbh
You think drinking piss would give a minimal amount of vitamins in there somewhere?
and if a casual player just happened to land in the sacred grove area they would ruin their save file if they got master sword
i got isg as a kid by mistake in mm
though that's unlikely. I think it's just possible for a casual to land on the ledge
@SwiftPichu_ only if you took extra vitamins and your liver was trying to filter them out
i haven't modified an emote in a hot minute
i don't think that's light arrows):
Almost everything used for clips is just rough
joey says the dumbest shit istg
The one sorta debatable is idk, rupee roll I guess?
close to 1 mil points so cant redeem anything
I mean you focused on ad so makes sense
who would want to play a seed where they turned of tresure charts except for lights arrows
Any other categories you want to learn other than glitchless?
I talked to this at glubs but yeah I do think ww and tp any% are probably the hardest ones
tp is a very punishing game
the early game is so obnoxious
it would be funny if you started with the grapple hook and all of the other items were in the tresure charts
And in the end game you're praying for good zelda
prime 2 is equally as obnoxious but for the whole run
prime 1 it kind of depends on what route you do
fastest route, yeah it's obnoxious the hwole time
I prefer elh to this so I'm not looking forward to doing this trick again when I learn ad
Is spr still one hit and you're dead?
I think you need to tap iron boots on and off a bit faster
but I have done a fair amount of pillar clip in the past
I want 2:57 or 2:56 first
ad I don't think can do elh without it complicating things
just because you need to beat forest temple
and also you need bombs to do it
I would say do wolfos jump but no midna on the back
what save it really needs is pot boost
hey phantom you should try the randomizer for this game
My seed today was abhorrent lmao
It made me last check every possible thing
Maybe I locked on too far up then..
Speaking of ik TP AP exists now altho it's like super duper early
That's the only way to let out anger...swinging a sword side to side lolz
Okay so question on  this one...is it considered glitched?
Had to make sure I'm sorry xD
How do you get that btw? Practice like certain parts over and over?
How do you access the practice tools on it?
No but I definitely wanna learn the poe skip
it was there at the very bottom
Not in eldin but can I see how you do the miniboss key skip?
Jesus christ I remember that xD
I'm still in awe of that
Still how do you get past the boss door lolz
Armogohma just give me the shard...we won't kill you
I'm gonna jork it to morpheel
Reminds me of an old animé I loved
I have my right to remain silent
Otherwise it's racism because I'm Mexican
Please do not rob me of this
Your backflip is in your epilogue on the sub 3:35
as someone who has failed at doing that a lot I can say it's hard.
Morpheel is just as bad as morpha
Wow. Already at Morpheel and still only 0 seconds into the run
D: but you have such a good time ATM
Well, hopefully next time goes better
Super tempted to learn it despite the challenge at this point
I had the dream of all time last night.
That wasn't very goated of them
That goat went "Nah fuck your speedrun"
They do randomly decide to just not go in sometimes I noticed
That goat was just sitting there waiting for you just to screw you over
Made it for ordon village LETSGORON
Didn’t grab the brown chicken NOPERS
Okay I’m redownloading yugioh… wish me luck KEKW
I actually have 550 hours in it. I have a problem I think lol
I’m so bad at the class trials in dangaronpa lol
I keep losing to the bullet time battle cuz they use nega time
I was hoping you would know KEKW I need to turn the difficulty down I think
It’s a collection I have the first and second one
but the third I’ll have to buy when I finish them
I tried to watch the anime for the first one but it was very repetitive I didn’t like it KEKW the game is much better
the fact it was based on the game makes it much better
ohh there’s no third game? lol
Don't forget about the weird danganronpa 3 anime watch order
being a teenager playing through those games is a crazy experience
@SeventyFourTG that's a nice way to put it
also yeah danganronpa 3 anime is ass
I would always see danganronpa 3 stuff at hot topic because I guess that particular anime is easier to license than the games
"Link are you fucking stupid" is such an early game Midna quote tbh
romani had to get abducted though
Pickles make me want to no longer exist
"you can fry most things" "okay i believe you"
i can't because i'm not midna, but she might be able to
...i just made a really stupid mistake
i got up to get water, instead made garlic aioli and prepped breadcrumbs and egg whites for pork chops, came back, sat down, water's still empty
Should I say... HAY everyone lolz
okay now i have water, didn't lose the run to kb1 i see
...fuck i'm corrupted by glitches, kb1 is after IB
How many dungeons has twilight ?
my balls went into my sword years ago, that's called puberty
Gotta have balls to make Link's sword glow
Dude I am dozing and going cross eyed but don't wanna set up for sleep yet
Where are you from ? Its 0.00 now for me 😅
i was testing my keyboard sounds
Alright screw it...imma take a quick nap...don't go too far
I didn't wanna miss the bulboln̈k
How exactly does lja with the boomerang work in this game? I don't quite understand when it works and when it doesn't
And I presume I can't jump up platforms with it? Just gaps?
Fucking...pain in boot woke me up
@thebloodlilly i mean you can, theyre called LJA's (long Jump Attacks) with very precise aiming with the boomerang but plain LJA's are banned in glitchless
I was dozing and setting up pillows and compression sock was rubbing on ankle
man i wish i could fall asleep fast. insomnia gang
When are you playing randos again?
Did someone ask this already? I'm sorry
Most zelda randos take too damn long
Tp feels a bit linear for a randomizer imo
Ey, Lanayru field does look good
I’m still doing this class trial. I don’t think my IQ is very good KEKW
I remember hating this minigame in the wii version
Mid you've played runnick, ffs you have the iq
Yes LMAO I keep losing to the manga wrap up thing now
And analog controls is just too slow also
Considering I plan on getting both versions whenever my wii arrives, it kinda does still help
@swiftpichu_ true I redownloaded it as well so hopefully I can make a new deck
Do gotta say, the gc version is expensive as hell nowadays
I'm still going to just play gamecube
I think German is still fastest
But Phantom, on wii you get both Midna AND Navi. That is double the companion character!
Jp saves 2 seconds over English
German was 6 or 7. Just bomb bag text
imagine not playing on a Korean wii
Korean is just hard to get and you need to mod your wii in a certain way
I mean the wii can also run the gc version can't it?
Are you for real brother I didn't even fucking curse
@midnaliin add me for free branded deck
Not wanting to interact with the wii menu is pretty valid
I haaated the stamps in hd
Like I'd go open a chest and it'd be a stamp for a feature that got shut down and it makes me all sad and lamenting an old era
The wolf Link amiibo is cool though
I finally passed the trial. I was expecting an F but I got a B KEKW
Don't the trials usually last like an hour or so? Was I just slow
It was a really long trial but I game overed about 15 times
Yeah 2 hours seems like an average time if you make mistakes
I can just imagine Link hearing the kid talk and being like "Fuck off kid". Truly the hero we need
its a reference to how fish hate both fire and ice
and some don't have issues with fire water
Frozen fish sure don't. In fact, those don't react to ice water at all
Dun dun dun, dun dun dun-dun (He's a phantom) dun-dun dun dun dun-dun (streamer phantom phantom phamtom). Runner Phantom was just starting a run when his Nintendo built a very strange machine, it was design to view a world or RNG (He's gonna 100% it all cause he's runner phantom) When it was too slow they just quit but then Phantom took a look inside of it. There was a great big gold, and everything had changed, His SOB got all re-arranged
Read it, I worked hard on it Madge
It wasn't easy to keep the correct rhythm to the theme song
maybe throw on the 4th flash instead of the 5th?
fair, i was just happening to look and saw you go on the 5th flash
...i had to get used to flashes on waterbombs before we did stallord skip with metronomes iceblueThisIsFine
the pattern is stupid too, it's 3 slow then 3 fast
Well then I'm not gonna finish the song SirMad
terry doesn't fuck with me often, he's scared of me
I didn’t even realize you could use bomb arrows for that lol!
Wow, what a neat item. I'd love it we could get it again
Maybe AD but I can’t remember the route if you do GM or lakebed first
I’m not too sure about hundo
Imagine being a bombfish. Being cursed with having a bomb in your mouth since birth
"Well Johnny how was the fishing trip?"  "Fish exploded again. Took the line right with it"
If you run to the left of that guy he will never hit you lol
Personally more of a fan of beyblading up to a giant skeleton monster
That skeleton monster use to be... something
darn of all temples I missed it was lakebed
RIP to that one guy on the twitch front page illegally restreaming the super bowl
Succeful stallord and ruins probably good 20 secs
Talking to him, like he's actually a dog
I mean he gets all the ladies
Ok. I created an audio version of the phantom theme parody
But I can't put in chat. Best I can do is a speech to text
Look I had to write the whole parody first okay
I keep locking my phone out of habit
So I wonder... did link really have to pull the sword out? I mean it was just to get the thing out of him
I mean he could've just got the shadow thing out and just left
Sure. But he KNOWS he's looking to go to the Twilight with Midna
So why would he not bring the one thing that can keep him human for that?
It's really more of a "They didn't know the crystal would stay intact so he can keep transforming"
You got sent to ad city?
mcdonalds wants me to buy a combo meal live on twitch
I have to compete with Glubbers NODDERS
"Hi I'm Michael Jordan" hi Michael Jordan! "McDonald's and I want to-" why did it have to be mcdonalds...
glubbers is gonna gift me a sub in 3
Yeah... remember he only follows the strongest side
Sub 6 lookin tasty and closer fatpidEyes
i have returned with my favorite resturant food
Late game clutch right now GLODDERS
Oh yeah may your owls be superb
I have two options for solutions m
Third option: make someone else pay for your sushi
Option 2 meets both of your requirements
Option 4: Learn farmin, fishing and how to prepare sushi professionally and never have to pay for it ever again
@thebloodlilly with today's sponsor skill share
Option 4 pays with the rarest ingredient tho: time
Don't forget the other rare ingredient... energy
Just start doing glitches to save time. since you lost time it’s fair Clueless
for those bugs i just ride up the sand with the spinner
Skirt go skinny come on phantom u kno this
If one thing is dead for sure, it's the enemies here
Your movement is lookin a lot smoother these last few runs
Link is really not collaborating with you today, huh?
Dude I wish I could be this good though
i spent a good five minutes wacking his head before realizing there was a spin in the middle
ashei is like the wednesday of zelda
@Midnaliin But Midna's been here since the staaart
Midna isn’t best girl until squidna
can't believe zelda did the zora dirty twice. the hot one is dead in this game and in botw
Zelda doesn't want us to have hot fish women
its so his wife can sled on him
yeto become sled just for wife
Hell yeah ice fishing everyday as well
no because there are bottomless pits
Yeah I went a couple weekends ago with the fam
the ice is like 20 inches right now or something crazy
Bumping his head against every wall in sight does not help with his brain function
It’s pumpkin spice season Yeto LETSGO
I always love how yeto just knocks you over to get the food
I think it misheard you. It threw the Link instead
make sure you correct the equips because they put claw on Y
oh yeah make sure the banner remains there
i forgot to mention i have a twilight princess wallet that i like had forever even though i never played it
i mean ive played it by now
file select is the same thing as brightness
you could also do wolfos super jump
you know, I wonder if japanese is optimal for this category
from what I hear people say it's more consistent on hd
yeah he's been practicing that trick a lot
he wants to use japanese for no s+q
it's faster specifically because map glitch doesn't work. it let's you use ooccoo to get map warping and also stay at the gorge
if you did that on NTSC or PAL that would give you map glitch and wouldn't let you enter kak
apparently my wallet is from 2013
yeah you have like 10 extra
here for the chill background stream
you don't HAVE to do that but it's faster
it skips a text box if you say no
in that dungeon i half expected the other suits of armor to come alive but they never did
it least it is not 100% snow peak
damn it seems none of the runs want to be nice today
Okay no yugioh is actually messed up right now. everyone keeps surrendering and won’t play with me KEKW
I like that they let you start with like. Everything else
I think it’s cuz I put my name as “ban branded” lol
I don’t understand someone else surrendered now LMAO
even if you pause to unequip it
you shouldn't need to unequip it in this though
dont you swim at the dash swim speed or whatever
even if you dont swim underwater i mean
for the record i just want to say big poes are ugly
omg wait. its that animal crossing runner
now i need to find a new place to burrow into
im just also a zelda runner too toma
how am i supposed to be like queen emeraldas and use isolation as my coping mechanism
i did tp like twice too pog
well i guess i did a bunch of ILs too
but yeah that pb today was really hype Gladge
the real speedrun is finishing the lettuce before it goes bad
i live alone so the lettuce always wins
I just gave up buying lettuce cuz I know damn well it will spoil in my fridge Sadge
do you know if PROPE worked on the fishing in this game
I know a few people from sega worked on this game but I'm wondering if they were part of prope because prope was responsible for a large amount of fishing games like fishing resort and ultimate angler for streetpass mii plaza
No hit A slow three times KEKW
D: Glitchless doesn't suck. There's no vacuum
Don’t forget to grab the dommy mommy
They've been misbehaving, standing over there instead of over here
isn't midna the dom in this game. she can float anywhere but she decided to sit her fat ass on link the whole game
link would probably run faster without her sitting the whole time
@TomaThePolliwog Both her and Link are switches, hence why she's in Link's shadown when he is human form
I haven't done this trick enough to know what went wrong
the nintendo ninjas patched your disk while you were sleeping
I think the visual cue is different based on where you stand
But idk the trick so I'm just spewing nonsense
my best guess is that the angle buffer was 1f late or early. not really sure
that is true. I just think the visual may be different depending on where you stand
yeah you can figure it out with gz
until you don't remember how to do sacred grove 2 and get lost
in my run i thought my health was good after city so I didn't grab the hc
turns out I only had 2.5 hearts so I had to transform to wolf after getting up
Sorry for the arrogance, I just feel like i'm talking to condescending people, who talk about skill, who think I'm just a high-level rager when they don't even know speedrunning guidelines.
it's in the minish cap discord
It's for more competitiveness, accessibility. But how can you say that, there are red lines that must not be crossed and accepting competitiveness with inequality is simply not serious at all.
Playing the game at a different speed has an effect on how you're playing - for example, playing a game in slow-motion and adjusting the time for it would be considered cheating. The fact that the Nintendo Switch doesn't play games at the same speed also means it's not emulating the Game Boy Advance in an accurate enough manner, which is another strike against speedrunning guidelines.
the TPR tournament literally just finished, I got pinged for getting 7th
exo said the job he interviewed changed the title to COO
his corporate account made like $3k in january, but he only gets half so he's sad
he's been streaming for literally 3 weeks
he applied for partner last week and was instantly denied because he's only been streaming 3 weeks
yo raven ty for the gl
yo phantom ty for the gl
exo was given like $5k in merch by one of his friends, for free, and told he can sell it all to pay bills
better to have gone early than never at all
Can I have a pizza bot
isn't that like the about the time that you would get to that fight in all dungeons?
there is a kitty on my lap now
Cat what are your thoughts Wind Waker
she isn't really paying attention to wind waker so i don't think has an opinion on it unfort
Oh you don't have that emote
Why does the seas of stars ost slap so hard? DangerDance
only acceptable form of transportation in this stream
i just see jr that could mean anything to me
just not allowed to redeem 1st anymore
Anyway, back to phanto274Lurk with me
i'm the red yoshi in RifeWife
i might be at a very low point mentally
Yoo Axl. how'd the rest of your seed go?
there is a logic trick it wants me to do and im very bad at it
what does a MS stand for all master sword?
our mirror charge those things you get when you defeat a boss
Molgera what are your thoughts on the super bowl
i think molgera is an eagles fan and the moldorms are chiefs fans
what do you mean streamer you have a shield right ther /pos
I am in pain...like every other day
2 more weeks til they tell me I can put weight on it
Probably targeted the boar and also zipped into the fire
Recommended insurance, offered a 3D baking pen, and told about making college easier
Only interested in one of those and I barely bake anymore xD
@kaitzumyth how was your ad city?
i need it to be Friday like now
one was about driving a car. I tabbed out after that
the best item in the game Fweet
Go to the general next time lolz
oh yeah right theres a discord
You have your hair out...gonna get hot
had a big ass spider run around the house today. i think its gohma in disguise
no it wasn't a baby lmao
But baby gohmas are huge compared to regular spiders
it even had freaking gaze detection like metal gear. when i looked at it, it ran away
i was like how the hell
Are you in like Texas or something lolz
I knew I should've gone with nevada
Midna, no I don't want to take the purple tic tac
I miss Florida weather and the beach
But then it snowed so now I'm skeptical
last time i heard our beach had flesh eating bacteria but I haven't been in years
its only snowed twice where i am in the past 25 years
You guys might have it on auto
I heard if you shade your AC unit outside sometimes it can cool easier / reduces your bill
Congrats on your spiritual journey fucker
Always wondered why yeto is just standing there
It's the dogs man...always throw me off
The sound the dogs make when they growl...I can't hear anything
I thought I was supposed to wait for the sound to get off the ladder and then reclimb?
When I first played this and saw the chest like that I thought "another ingredient?"
oh yeah i did the three month i forgot lmao
i set that up like, a week ago
bcuz it was like "of youre sub is gonna expire in x days" and i was like, eh, why not
i had to cull alot of my subs bcuz i realize alot of them were spur of the moment things and im like.. i aint got that kinda money soz
Surprised that letter isn't dripping too
like im sorry i cannot sub to ALL of my friends expecially if i don't actually WATCH all of them
NOOOO only need 1 more pokemon to complete genetic apex
i been trading my alt account and it doesn't have the last card i need Madge
tbh my biggest struggle atm is that like, all of my twitch subs come out in the same week LMAO like i did not space them out at all
you cant trade full art ex
I feel like I always sub to people and then while my sub is active they don't stream and I'm like dang it
now that i have a job i will be able to have subs again :)
today was my first day. i mean ive worked in a salon before so i know i like it but the enviornment is nice
and i get all my services free
oh i got the mew guess you don't need all cards
i had uh *checks notes* 12
oh gosh ive never subbed with anything above a tier 1, if im giving someone that much money im going straight for the kofi/donate link
like not to be ungrateful but i had someone gift me 12 subs the other day and theyre like "man i spent 60$on that"
i t3 monado when i first started on twitch
streamer I knocked where's my collab kazamsCatglub
and i tried so hard not to say like "please donate large amounts to me directly instead i only get half of that" lmao
A week of doing rando and my 1st one where I forgot how to do boomerangless forbidden woods basement was my fastest LOL
like ill gift a sub to either :join a hype train, or Give a cool viewer add free viewing
Hulu should give you mass amounts of money again tbh
if i just  wanna throw money at the streamer id do bits or donate directly
why did link just not hit them
but yeah i set up a !donate command to periodically just kinda throw out there as a warning
can we get a fact check
i prefer kofi over the paypal bcuz paypal.me shows me real name phanto274Facepalm
phantom games bot knows something we don't monkaW
isnt that the onbe that just c came out and is currently on sale? or was at least
ive never played a paper mario game so i cannot have a worthy opinion on it
but the origami one looked neat
there is the switch one for $60
i dont think there is a way for one to see viewers channel points amount
yeah that would have been neat. not to mention if the switch one fixed the localization instead of fixing one thing and censoring others
its like theres no perfect version
and why doesn't the OG sounds badge actually revert the sound effects also??
the lucky sound from ttyd is one of my phone notifications
they totally changed all the dialogue where the goombas hit on goombella in the sewer which was perfect to the japanese translation in the original
oh duh! just read live splits
whats the next game release on your list?
bestbuy preorder has a metal poster
do you think they will add the boob slider back
my next game release is on Friday widehypeE
i just walked in, what does the us release of TMS have to do with anything
"Gee, I can't wait to have 2 physical copies of Xenoblade Chronicles X!" -Some guy probably
I know the b o o b slider was the big thing
I mean switch loading for something like super mario 3d world was slightly slower, so if xenoblade chronicles X does end up being faster I will be surprised
@TomaThePolliwog You didn't have to wait for auto saves to finish though
i swear there was one case where it wasn't
maybe I'm thinking of new super mario bros U
I'll just say the Xenoblade X on Wii U didn't really seem like the most optimized thing with having to download asset packs to make the game load faster
I wonder if the asset packs were a situation where they originally used compression but it took longer to decompress the data from disk than just reading it uncompressed
@TomaThePolliwog Wii U was a slow system in every regard so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the cade
didn't nintendo update the switch to have more input delay for wired controllers?
i actually hate the ps5 controllers. they give me arthritis really bad
something about the face buttons is too hard to press
i forget which game its for but i know switch games also load significantly faster if you use airplane mode
at least it's early and not late
I believe that is just high enough to not be able to roll
people generally aim for the stairs
Suffered really my first theft. My Ebike was stolen today when i was grocery shopping
Are you submitting anything to mwsf
or is it just not showing on the list 4 me
Oh damn right I forgot buff00n just didn't communicate shit to you I should've LOL
We were gonna plan to do that all again if you were in but I guess I shouldve done that myself
You got 5 hours left so if you wanted to last minute you probably could
Could always just submit this and a random pape thing that wouldnt need to be heavily derusted
Yea it would be nice if you were there to see you but if not it saves me money on hotel I suppose
I'll very likely be going to gdq so at the very least I'll see you there
I haven't been to one since agdq 2019
and that was because it was in my state
Minneapolis is a nice place to dick around
I was considering agdq this year too but none of my friends were going
I could have driven there. oh well
they should move a gdq to pnw
I want a reason to go there and no fg events are up there lmao
I will drive if it's 7 hours or less to get there
i want to learn it at some point
The wording could be better there kazamsCatglub
no you cant go to youtube bot
for the quick B&C fight? it's up-up
get jumpstrike and just moon boots jump strike over the gate
the collision is colliding too well
man that bike was the final christmas present from my dad how could today after the superbowl be the faith in humanity lost moment. avarie1Cry laserg8SCREAM phanto274Cry ghunzoSad urooglOopsAD
i think someone stole food out of my moms car the other day
things are just bad i guess
that was a really good run too
environat one of my fave streamers got mugged on a japan trip 30 mins in a coma for bystanders to call for hospital and woke up itemless. It could be worse if i waas there the knife or gun could be used on em.
it can help to do the rolls in pairs rather than chaining a bunch
when you chain a bunch you can keep too much speed
I was trying to figure out how to say that
wasn't watching closely but I can probably help debug if you open gz after this
I think it's a good idea to slash the pot right as you climb in case walking into the pot affects the angle adjustment
idk whether it can really make a difference, but it doesn't cost time to slash it
this is not the right angle
I think the angle ends in 33 or something
just try to be in the same spot every time. the frame can be confusing based on where youstand
We shall lock this down and Victory run!
i feel like zsr needs some updated videos
that hyrule castle barrier one (inside) is uh
it is yoloable but does matter
it's approximately 2 colors and 2 pixles
it's somewhat lenient but the important part is the wall pushes you a lilttle bit into the statue
what happens is push colliders are disabled for 1 frame after transforming
i think there's an early city save iirc i could be wrong
I kinda just walk until the first time both of link's feet are on it
that was nearly as far right as you can get it to work
I like to have a sharper angle when I do it though
oh god hopefully i don't fail it let me check before I get called out
Chatting the strat is to fail it 3 times and curse a lot and then get it
I did not fail it let's go
but I think I did not fail it in the leaderboard run either but I did in fact mess up the shadow beasts for a long time
this is probably a question for the discord tbh
but is using the "launch disc" option in prriloader allowed
I wonder if there's a strat to consistently avoid it
for me it seems 50/50 if he hits you or not
I think people bomb boost over ice boost
it's the bomb boost, not ice boost
I have heard bad things about ice boost
don't think I've ever heard anyone say anything positive about it
I think you bomb boost, go around the room and do some LJAs to skip the freezard
ice boost is quite position and angle precise and so has a lengthy setup, then ends in a frame perfect LJA
bomb boost is a 3f window to start holding up, EZ
and is easily buffered if you wanted to do that
glitchless used to do that bomb boost before lfc
I sure hope the no s&q route doesn't beat blizzeta
(i had someone speaking in my ear didn't quite catch it
it did the bomb boost then did the cannon ball shenanigans
anyone who likes no s&q likes it because of nostalgia
I remember in 2014 when I wanted to learn this game I "started" with no s+q
I haven't done Forest Temple no s&q either
I got to boko pushing and gave up
no save and quit means you have to walk all the way out the dungeons and thats lame
you have not done glitchless low%.
actually the backtracking in dungeons is the cool part of no s&q
the less cool part is having one try at rupee roll before you have to go beat diababa
you could always mash jumpslashes over the fence for a minute or however long it is
@Draconif hmmm what does this skip
I think just 2 portals and the heart containers
I really didn't think at all
you get to run to hidden village from west castle town field
takes like 5 minutes or so
if messenger skip is allowed with keese LJA you could also skip that i suppose
but I think it's specifically banned
my room has a door that goes outside, so i do have a bedroom key i guess lmao
monkaS I hope your room is on the first floor then
FeelsOkayMan not falling to your death
technically my room is slightly below ground but lmfao
felis room leads to the catacombs
id lock the door too if that were the case
feli can you add peepoSled pauseBedge
it's like peepo is sledding across yeto's head
if ive never beaten minish cap but i have two of the bird hats for cosplay am i cool enough to be in the club
mm on switch is faster but is bad so no one cares
sounds like the Wii U VC vs Nintendo DS drama
Wild World loads so much faster on Wii U
@Feli_Heli Doesn't it being faster also make the mask salesman skip harder?
thats part of the reason no one plays on switch
when game devs tie game speed to framerate
I think Touhou 6 is like that also
I had an issue where the game was ludicrously fast at 220fps
link go SNIFFA before it was cool
i feel like i remember people saying that pal mm has extra patches as well, but tbh idk because no one talks about pal lol
i would take an ique just to try the chinese version of doubutsu no mori
isnt animal crossing on the ique
the chinese version of DnM actually has items exclusive to it related to the construction theme
i think they were previously undocumented until this year
animal forest is so much better on gamecube though, the pause lag on n64 is awful
you lose like a whole second to pausing
i should get back to DnM all fish now that i have a new crt
i don't have an official 1019 memory card so I don't submit runs
animal crossing speedrunners are sensitive about memory cards
i have the slowest memory card lmfao
yeah i have three of those
you know they allow 3rd party ones now
I have a madcatz from 2010
but I wonder if swiss would be faster saving
wii is faster saving to memory cards
tbh i dont really care about saving times because fish rng will screw you anyway lmfao
I was trying "goldmod" by cuyler which mitigates the fish/bug rng a little and got like 2 1/2 hours on all golden tools
goldmod also locks the town seed
at least in zelda you can just start runs immediately and you don''t have to reset for good layouts
do you think Link gets dizzy despite the fact that the spinner does not spin him
it was slightly too far right
and this one and the one two ago were not angled enough
midna: what do you plan on doing with this link
this man is the only clown that is allowed to exist
i still dont understand why the occcoo had to have like 16 nipples or whatever
apparently today was a big day for me and I didn't even know it
got home and a streamer with like 16k subscribers reached out to me becuase of my work with the cpus in smash ultimate
so now I get to work with them to make custom stuff for em
Well ARE they actually birds? Like have we seen them lay eggs? They could be bird like mammals
cows have four teats, bunnies have 8-10 i think cats have 6
Only the most important questions in the twilight princess speedrunning community
does fan skip not count as a glitch
i think its implied they were a race that like chimera'd themselves
@thebloodlilly even if they do lay eggs, they could still be mammals. Echidna and platypi lay eggs but are mammals
got too use to you doing glitchless
yeah thats why I was doing master sword glitchless runs
So theoretically, they could be egg-laying mammals that are freaks
it definitely makes them interesting, TP is so inteeesting
the way it starts downpouring and it helps u out is really neat
god bro i think i just spent 3 hours debugging an issue that literally required me to just reverse the order of operations. time for me to go see my bunny for emotional support
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I’m going to get Yu-gi-oh cards for Valentine’s Day
start to build that shining sarco deck
Nice end of stream for sure
perfect, was just about to take a nap
apparently, I missed work today. Oops / shite.
I had a banana pudding boba tea
it even had bits of the cookies that only go in banana pudding and nothing else
when i need to have two tabs open
thats where a lot of my time loss in the beginning is
Yo gl Phantom! hope Epona listens better later lol phanto274GL
oh and the bridge thing happens to me a bunch too
yeah the first time i saw how close you could run near them my jaw was on the floor
to get to the other side! LUL
Im very interested in glitches in this game. Dies it work like OoT ?
@shrike890 u dont die like u do in OOT
The thibgs you must do to use the glitches 🤔
@shrike890 OoT uses a n64 controller and TP uses a GC/Wii controller. hope this helps
@shrike890 they patched out of bounds areas (unless u wanna do pegasus horse)
is going OOB a glitch or an exploit CaitThinking
coro cant turn his head fun fact
its actually just bone. he doesnt have any ligaments to articulate rotation
No he just has bad peripheral vision
i didnt realize they gave it back to you without oil
when do we get phantom 100% :P
at least AMS is always waiting there for you
Not having easy ways to save time besides "don't fuck up!" does suck
the game is trolling you atp
That sounds right just based on the amount of runners without having seen GZ
Do you think Bo is short for "Boy this guy is annoying?"
No that's a brutal place to have RNG
When RNG messes you up only one thing you can do ZygardeSmokingWeed
Made it for death mountain LETSGORON
It’s a running theme now KEKW
I bought cigarettes for one of the seniors today and the poor lady at the cash looked so concerned for me she thought I was buying it LUL
She was like assessing my ID hoping it was fake
Should have thrown in something else as a power move just to flex your adult buying power
@tomathepolliwog I couldn’t cuz I was using their money lol
can you give the tldr on this speedrun category for me
for the record i was here when you were targeting that bug where links wolf ass kept getting shoved in my face and it took me that long to recover
so we have a premade save for this category?
What is that game over audio from? it sounds so familiar but I can’t place it
i forgot i need to pick up a saturn
puyo puyo sun is on the saturn
I would help you but I still suck at PC apparently KEKW
i wasnt paying attention and when i looked back at stream i was very confused how you had made it to snowpeak so fast
Was just gonna say yea BiTE does not loose too much. That also would mean not having to do Gorge Void
but I feel the PC, last run loosing 5 minutes to it SadgeCry
I only got a back up if you are 1 frame early but besides that it is just annoying
@spicy_juice04 you need to show me the backup cuz I’m always 1 frame early lol
I tried to do the backup improvised but it wasn’t working out KEKW
@Midnaliin well you have very limited air after so it is very hard after if you miss tap swimming
I want to say I will have enough air but god knows I just make it in every time
with like a frame of air
Did you watch the rockos quest GDQ video last night phantom PauseChamp
I'm rubbing off on phantom too much
I would if I didnt have to play sd lmao
I'd be willing to do it for the one time but I will bitch a lot about moving in sd LOL
I lose my menuing my aiming and my movement speed
I thought the channel was pretty new for it
Get them to update terraria archipelago and then we're golden
It's been almost 2 years since archipelago worked for current patch terraria lol
Get morph to do oot or something with you
He's done a couple of those
Oh I guess it'd make sense if that's on there I'm just looking at official on the site lol
I would prefer MM but I know they're still working on it
I'm decent enough at WW tho it doesn't matter too much
Since I'm in there every night
If you make a day of it I would be willing to do WW still I just need to be a week removed from hd lol
I'm also not opposed to learning OOT more
I have learned I am not fond of cheese hunts in SOH
It isn't bad in WW cause it's just 8 and it has a check behind it
When I first learned the run I wondered why that door took forever to open
then realized you’re unlocking it lmao
Perceive all the fucks I give, Midna
Kevin we said to die Madge
is it a new sticker for yeta toes
Hey Phantom? You're cursed you know that?
its a funny idea but I shouldn't suggest it because i would only buy midna stickers
I’m about to join a zoom webinar. taking me back to the college days LUL
I need to take one on computer basics 101 at some point KEKW
it’s about more mindful exercise classes for seniors lol
Arbirters ground was a great temple for it
Everyone knows the best Zelda item is the tingle bottle from wind waker hd
Idk I know it's omega useless outside of it but damn that was a good dungeon
me = back to watch u till i sleep
Exactly! An item that gives you an error messege! Best item in gaming history, present and future
Damn maybe I should replay windwaker hd to see what all the hype about it is :)
I only own the gc version yea
My ass got it 10+ years ago for like $30-40
I do not but I also have emerald
I'm just reaping the benefits of younger me for buying a bunch of retro games
Bro did not vibe with the universe
It's funny to me how tp for te gamecube is like 100 euro at its cheapest, meanwhile I can get the wii version for cheaper than going out to eat
Oh, some more ams today I see?
Lucky me, I know for a fact my next glitchless run will be a pb, because it'll be my first lmao
I am not that kind of artist
You will simply have to find someone else
Okay, I got the reference picture and one and a half month drawing experience. Wanted to draw my dnd character, but eh
Yooo Phantom, good luck! phanto274ColonD phanto274BLANKIES
I believe in the first try dot skip
it was certainly an experience avarie1Laugh
i'm still not fully sure what that person was so upset about tbh
after two days of externship at the vets office I have tomorrow off. I am going to sleep in and no one is going to tell me otherwise. 🤣
originally for oot it was made by someone named glank iirc
I have no idea why wind waker or tp do it
well it's gz for tp so just call it tpgz i guess
it does help to do the rolls in pairs
like 2 rolls at a time basically
5:56:17 monadoSmile (that's the time rn)
i'm back on windows 10 i have a second counter again you can't lie to me
@TheGlubbers i'm on windows 97 :)
I feel like your plushie collection keeps getting bigger lol
weren't you talking about how free dot skip was in my chat the other day
honestly fair, i'm just giving you shit
Just wait until there’s a giant Gardevoir behind Phantom in 2 to 3 weeks
that emote is a lie, it's not the tears of the kingdom master sword
you've been in this run for 20 seconds and lost time already
no i meant the text draw cancel you didn't do
if you have the area banner and want to warp or do an action prompt like a door, pull and close the item wheel and save a second-ish over waiting for the text to go away
no i don't give people shit for that
i just laugh at how i scare people with how aggressively i blind snowboard
Okay webinar over NODDERS how did the first run go Phantom
dammit df's here now i can't spew bs
i also haven't said any bs yet
Everyone in my profession is very bubbly and wholesome so it was good KEKW
We meditated during some of it
im gonna ask my boss if we can meditate during work hours
i'm just judging your spr dw
I can't believe your run died to sugma
@midnaliin new legends anthology, pick the exodia deck, easy wins, also hi KEKW
I almost won against that deck with my witchcrafter deck @swiftpichu_
I’m probably going to stick with witchcrafter and swordsoul for now
Glubbers will teach you the way of PC NODDERS
I think i only ever finished 5 runs
I honestly would have kept going but 5 and a half hours is so exhausting
Have fun in your spiritual journey with yeto
glitchless is probably still my favorite category in this game
glitchless is cool to watch but it seems kinda miserable to play tbh
I didn't think it was too bad. the beginning drags on a little too much
Glitchless is like all Zelda games, just grind movement a fuck ton that you're burned to hell OpieOP
but after master sword it's so good
@SwiftPichu_ i hate practicing movement though SadgeCry
I enjoyed forest temple and mines as well
It's OK nimbus we all hate movement
I do love rolling from ordon spring to eldin twilight
the first 30mins of tmc any% are honestly almost worse than swamp imo KEKW
maybe I just have glitchless blood
Also yeah mid, trickstar, witches and most likely a zombie deck can beat it
I don't like glitchless in the prime games though
it's just no oob with more restrictions
I also like paper mario glitchless
and glitchless in primes are just... so hard to define because the movement mechanics in the games are pretty busted
I knowww you and everyone else hates running Pape glitchless :(
omg if it gets accepted I will die
that would be the most hype thing ever
NOTED i did in fact never notice
quit staring at my with them big ol eyes
no way it's as good as the snake eater ladder
@Draconif sure but can i do 1 glitch?
I will not allow you to get master sword and escape the forest
glitchless jotwad is probably like 1:05 or something
Relay multigame comin Yes! pls do it!
this came up at GDQ actually, the 3D zelda jotwad challenge
there was a time where I wanted to do a 3d zelda glitchless challenge
but then botw came out and I didn't want to do it anymore
Gotta love the REAL speedrun categories
skyward sword would have been really fun to learn but wind waker was just ugh
I personally like mweep% in oot
I do not like how wind waker controls that much
tp has spoiled me with curved rolls
I think majora's mask has the best glitchless run out of all the 3d zeldas
it's a nice length and it has interesting routing and the dungeons are all fun to do
i've heard great things about mm glitchless
i do also like oot glitchless
if i wasn't so nmg pilled, i'd play it more
within the span of an hour I've eaten a tuna sandwich + chips, a cup of yogurt with the works, a breakfast sammich and am about to eat a bowl of rice + sweet n' sour chicken
I don't understand why that happens
it's some seam bullshit or something
so far i've learned why people hate HMS skip on n64
@buff00n that’s based are you sharing with the class (me)
yeah when i tested my hori for laundry pool clip, i couldn't get n64 hms once lmao
i thought the hori angles were for the warp not for laundry pool clip
@Midnaliin I mean, I *do* like cooking
@buff00n okay sweet I’ll be in your walls shortly NODDERS
i also just hate the hori its so small lmao
idk much about the observatory stuff but i think you need good cardinals for laundry pool clip
that controller is a bowser throw machine and sometimes bow spook
eh i'll figure it out soon, i also have 1.2 oot (thanks gortho) so i can't kekw house
it felt way better than trying it on gamecube controller
that route is actively bad when you're trying to go fast
it's always fighting against you lmao
and bowser is just worse overall than spook route
this stun loop looks way funnier than the ones in MM lmfao
im on strike against the postman actually
they should make a run thats like AMS but also you do the mirror shards too and ganon too while youre at it
anyone want to do a quick get to palace of twilight race
@Feli_Heli idk where i was going with this message tbh
I picture him saying it with an american ass accent
today i learned sayonara was a Japanese word
if that happens you just adjust left
I've been sitting for a good 2 minutes trying to think of something so I have come to the conclusion that I'm not funny and no one likes me
Well, I may agree that your not funny, but I wouldn't say I dislike you
@SplashV_ Splash, do you need to step into my office? My doors are open.
00's aren't letters, therefor it is not proper grammar
I am Hella improper, so it's fine
@SplashV_ That's easy, all you have to do is go "how about that pallos am I right?" to get the whole room laughing
dost thou wishith to perish by thine blade argorok-sire?
You know I don't want to talk him 24/7 he's bad for my blood pressure
if you really wanna make people laugh, just say allot of random ass one liners
He's right behind me isn't he
see thats a good one liner
atleast you get to try again on that
the 7tv site is so slow now
also if all else fails and you're not funny, simply just be funny @SplashV_
I think he might just hate you too
whats the point of phase 2 when you get to just shoot him for free
so would TP link also be the hero of time since he goes back in time to save Hyrule from the twilight
if we think about the lore, the original hero of time is the one that first aquired the dominion rod and the one the oocoo here is waiting for
So link from tp showing up would mean he by proxy becomes the hero of time in this timeline
i was doing skyward sword pacifist
and i lost the run because i accidentally slashed a chu
pacifist is trying to beat the game without damaging or killing any enemies
so we can do a credits warp to skip demise and it's basically about doing that credits warp and skipping all the enemies and bosses along the way
You ever take your urn for a walk
is it possible for it to stop on the first one
Let gohma do what he wants you're in his house
...i have one attempt in AMS
just gotta cut 1s now :)
oh just got back nice sick pb! phanto274GG
i think there are very few runners that can yolo AD
i just happen to be one of them
I like your funny words magic man
that is not a normal reason to not be able to yolo it
how was your faron bomb boost
sorry of course my TV glitched out right at the end of the run
sorry sienna that was my microwave
yeah can you turn that damn thing off glubbers
sure i'll turn my microwave off for you sienna, i only microwave with consent
you'd do S&S Skip, EMS, finish forest temple and faron, go do eldin, warp back to faron, get Bo TD, go unlock GM, go back to Bo, get IB, go back to GM, do dungeon
it's functionally similar to how GM RTA used to be
fun fact i've done 1 AFS run too
it was a 1:27 where i didn't know the route and was yoloing a submission for drdq
pirate is a fun stupid cat ext
gay rta is unofficial but exists
i can get the gay rta route doc if you want
i want to learn the glitched version
nice cameo from Link and Epona in the song there :P
In two days I’m going to buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards again
yo, so what's new in the build?
state of play start in 3 mins so brb !lurk
If I have a small amount spare I might buy into Sky Striker due to the promotional shorts they did
Again I’m playing for fun, no sort of meta involved
sky striker seems cheap to build
get used to those chat because she has a sword and irons
wareho5Hellooo gl on the rando run
i finally started getting into this rando but need to find good settings
phanto274GL iceblueGL  the usual for rando runs
Those 4 shop gorons back there should all be available immediately
Each of the different ones is their own single item shop
Pause, click on Options, then press Z
also just noticed we got Witcher Link
the chicken thing became much easier when i realized you could let go of the chicken early. i had been trying to fly just long enough to land on the targets
i did ice puzzle without looking anything up but it took me like an hour
so that probably means im dumb as rocks
I think for the puzzle to work well in a race they would need to change the puzzle solution
Removing the check depends on how the numbers work out, but it is by far the first to die if one does lol
I mean the name is accurate
Generally I can't get over that the music in tp is sooooo good
Each track wonderfully conveys the emotions it's supposed to give off I love it
Anyway gonna head to bed now (it's 11:40 pm) , good luck with the run
>.> phantommm  im now at 46k  gettin closerr
Gate keys is what unlocks that
and like usual gonna have u in background till i pass out
idk why but ur nice and happy soothing to have in backgroudnd
Oh yeah it is just disabled for Weak. That confused me too ngl
Lunar is working on freestanding Rupees. I think currently it is literally only the Kak Village bell
Oh yeah they are everywhere lol
Dig as a different thing would make sense
for some reason twitch wants me to knock on your stream, even though im not streaming
borderlands 4 release date was the best part
@Feli_Heli twitch wants you back click here to take us back pls don't leave us --twitch
i really like the ordon song and the lake hylia song in this game
honestly I feel like if they added some depth to it, link fishing could have been its own game
imagine like fishing with midna that would have been raw
thats my favorite way to do this fight
We know Agatha cleaned him out
So does that mean she's a better sumo wrestler than Lonk is
The rage inducer that is G O A T S
Required G O A T S
It might be due to portal work being done
You can pick some portals as starting items now
HOLD this a all sanity and i miss 50 mins of it Sadge
Hey phantom did you know there's a rando for this game you could try it's pretty cool
Also state of play was boring as expected lol
But the early listing I saw was real there's a new digimon coming
Most of the rest was just the classic pre-rendered cutscene into 2026 lol
where was my re9 trailer Madge
Sony shows are boring I dont think it's worth it over just waiting for headlines
i have loogt up you pm rando for gdq was fun to wathc <3
That statue jump scared me when I first saw it the other day lol
In front of the ToT door. It was not there in 1.2
Hold pot and quick transform while standing in that left corner
phasmid, lil phasmid. I want to tie your antannae into cute bows.
The Sacred Wood Sword that all Legend of Zelda Links start with
The Wood sword that can hurt Ganon too out of all the Wood Swords in Zelda
I honestly never understood why they added bottled water in this game because its just never used
you *can* get stuck but you can also throw one of the tiny statues over to get inside
Bingo 3 poes all worth 5 bucks
Phan didn't find that one funny lolz
"Are there any souls that aren't just a blue rupee"
Cursed by the blue and orange rupee
what is it thief? I mean, vaan
it’s funny how links wrist gets locked in place
excuse me was that poe soul a poe soul?
Would you believe that the best thing gotten from a Poe Soul was just a broken heart container
Agitha is rearing her head at us now
Agitha is really staring at you
lil ant, lil ant. please lift me up and carry me like a princess
it would be awesome if they did a hide and seek rando, where they filled dungeon rooms with bugs and like left one of the bugs as the bug you need so you have to like squint your eyes and shit
Imagine if this dungeon is just full of cash because it's the Poe dungeon
imagine it all being cache and getting a larger wallet instead of a heart container at the end
The prophecy is starting to look correct
lil ghost rat, lil ghost rat. won’t you tug on my hair and make me a chef
One nice thing among all the cash
Okay that was the only redeeming thing among the poes so far
Link isn't a Wolf he's a Husky
rgamer hitting too close to my elementary days
What did you have a Husky in the family?
Lot of videos of them in the internet doing goofy things
I’m not sure what my favorite dog is. maybe a collie.
I've seen a video of Border Collies herding a Husky
I used to watch a lot of lassie
Border Collies are also known for being intelligent energetic dogs
I’m just not a dog owner type person. too much maintenance
I was about to call that
even cats as well these days. I mean I’ve had cats for over 18 years, my patience cleaning litter boxes with asthma is wearing thin
whatever’s in litter goes right through masks too
I feel ya on the upper respiratory problems
I kind of have them myself
right now I have 3 cats and a rabbit
@tomathepolliwog your rabbit has to have trust issues around 3 cats KEKW
she actually wants to fight the cat who is a bully. she got along with my oldest cat when he was alive.
I have to pull her away because she will get her eye taken out by the cat
Omg that’s so cute I need to see her trying to square up lmao
the cat doesn’t know what is happening
idk how you did that in one cycle but that was impressive
3 buggies, hopefully that's enough for Agitha
I’m cooking up the best chicken Alfredo right now phanto274Jam
Yeah I’ll bring it over in 5 NODDERS
you can ship some to me with dry ice right
You actually have to be here to do the dishes MadgeRn
@tomathepolliwog absolutely I’m actually in your walls so I can hand deliver it
the first time i played snowpeak i completely missed this room and its like the cannon tutorial room
No need gale banana and bedroom key in order to hit go and find the right bugs
they should make it so he doesn't have ball and chain if you've found it already, there can only be 1 :P
ball and chain in the ball and chain fight monadoLFS
I made a steak for dinner
Whelp don't need Agitha's sword anymore
uhhh I do have 5 more raw ones
I do like them medium rare so just a fare warning if that’s not your thing
Is that a new to 1.3 thing or is it just you're used to vanilla?
anything past medium well is a crime
I prefer medium but when I go out to a restaurant I always order medium-rare cause generally they always overcook it cause they don't want to be sued unless you go to like a real fancy restaurant.
if I ever get back into the dating scene, I could never order a t-bone because I look like a orc when I eat those
what's wrong with looking like an SMOrc ?
I just noticed right before you said it too lol
how to unlock the REAL light sword in twilight princess
The sword that all the dogs would lick
I prefer lemon-flavored sword personally but yeah
it works better if claw is on X
I was gonna ask worse than ice block puzzle but at least that is consistent
you definitely can LJA to the chest
except that boomerang is looking to be the go mode item
I don't remember having any problems with this chest casually but idk that might just be me blocking out the PTSD or just me having given up after like 2 tries...
Agitha always has the good items
Maybe this time you'll get 50 rupies!
wtf kind of carnival game has spike pits btw?
that feels like a lawsuit waiting to happen
I mean Hyrule is built on top of a void
Can't get more dangerous than that
I should try another one of these but not randomize agitha
last time I had to hunt down a male pillbug to get the stupid lantern
I had returned with amazing news
it also feel like lake hylia cave always has something because it has 1 trillion checks
I'm probably also gonna exclude hyrule because I don't want to go on a scavanger hunt for the boss key or keys
We've created a ninja like Samus on a game dual wielding guns with bigger boobs
Weird lag just happened but okay
well that eliminates half the checks!
I'm gonna make a guess and say goron
what if it's in forest temple lmao
Dangoro is literally a bully NOPERS
So I haven't uh...set up a rando in a while because I preset some before the injury happened
Was there a setting where the shards and shadows could be literally anywhere?
so do you have to complete dungeons or is it just get everything necessary to complete Hyrule Castle?
I deadass was about to ask why you didn't LJA over
I'm too lazy to grab my laptop and go to the website
you can put your glitchless knowledge to use here now to get through the door at least right since you can't LJA?
so how's your day been, Phantom?
I freaked out but didn't realize lolz
Link with the DMC 4 standing on the door as it falls over
Do you have ice traps on?
traps feel like they're just a time waster tbh
Supposed to be faster with the master blaster
so that's why his forehead was glowing orange
@darkness3827 I think the real meaning is that helping people cost time and money
you gonna pick up that $100 bill.
and the sugar is so fine you lose half of it to the air when you scoop it out
clearly you gotta do all the double dom rod checks :P
ok im prepared to challenge these statements lemme look at my box
Im telling you Toma....mostly salt than sugar
for daily value maybe. 7% salt and 8% sugar. but its only 150mg of salt, and 22g of sugar, that's like ~1400x more sugar than salt
Damn...I'm glad I didn't bet on it xD
its basically diabetes. but i get it because the flavor is nostalgic for me
my grandpa used to drink it
22 grams of salt might kill you lmao. Okay prolly not but it'd be very unhealthy lmao.
yeah it would do something alright lmao
1:44 with these settings would be impressive
i always wondered why sometimes they used the bug sounds for the key
and then other times the keys weren't shiny
like did a bunch of playtesters just completely not notice the key drop??
to dip your piss sword into
i only bottle the ripest piss
I think it's an AR code for Gale Boomerang @Phantom5800
Ads make the world go around
dub and you won't see ads.
Why does your sword look like it was dipped in piss
@darkness3827 I would if I had money and a job
Maybe someone will be kind enough to gift you a sub
if you get light sword will it look even more like piss or like a different color?
I kinda doubt it Monado. I've either been gifted one or rain would get it for me
Yeah but now we gotta save money for a part for his car...I think he said it was the exhaust?
I would be forever grateful if someone did Monado
I got beaten to gifting Anni so Monado gets one ig lol
the usual 5 rupees from a poe
You know what to add onto the scam train...
Cheer100 Have bitties from the spare pile
yay we leveled up our scam train to level 2!
@darkness3827 nah midna got me on this one
jolteon is passed the fuck out behind ya glennj5Sleepy
Cheer100 sonic: hey kids donate to my scam train to get scammed lol you dumb babies
Don't you mean 2 dead poes
nah there was that 1%er poe with $100 on him.
that's a value of idk, $20???
The most useful thing the Poes had on them was a small key to snowhead
The sign translated from hexadecimal to ascii says "I hope you have a great day!"
49 20 68 6f 70 65 20 79 6f 75 20 68 61 76 65 20 61 20 676 72 65 61 74 20 64 61 79 21
whoops. i messed up on that one digit should just be 67
thats cheating can yopu go back and do it correctly?
oh shit I got a pill bug too!
what's that like the 6th vanilla poe?
Okay I’ll be over Monday sounds good
I'm getting a Chicken Shawarma on Valentine's day
piss money to go with your piss sword
I can't wait for Ape Escape to do another crossover and never get a new entry
I thought the snowpeak one was the worst chest
I am currently getting hammered by a snow storm
I’m dipping out but good luck on the rest of rando NODDERS
whose idea was it to make those ledges that small they deserve a fine of like 50 rupees at least
Oh there sure is stuff here, never said it was good stuff though
well we know spinner is somewhere.
Damn is that a GPU on your rupee count or are you just happy to see me
need to have enemies do quad damage so health actually matters or something lmao
So can I talk about poop rq? Because there's a scary thing on my mind
did you know bunnies eat their own poop
@seventyfourtg I know that reference lolz
But uh...my niece in law. Whenever she poops it looks like either explosive or the size or a golf ball. She's almost 3
All I could think is "how the hell did that come out of you??"
maybe she has an intolerance to certain foods
im not experienced with toddler poop
I just went to the bathroom and due to pain pills: constipation. Shit (no pun intended) hurt like hell. How does she even handle that
yeah, I almost never take pain pills for that reason
that and my liver is bad, so its not good for me anyway
Hospital gave oxy which helps because of the boot
You can't take like Tylenol or ibuprofen? Also they give her miralax because she won't if she doesn't
Most of the time I do randos...iza is dead
Hey you found the rang! Where was it?
The one place they didn't want to go...had to go to
you can talk to the duck also
idk if he'll give you a hint
too many animals was my scathing review of animal well
somehow you can get turned around and go down the river backwards
Dumb send button. If they're not then animals should include hints
Idr who but someone has been saying that lolz
I love talking to that one chicken who is like. "I think I'm going to get eaten""""
Oh shit I can phanto274Howl now
Toma wasn't there one who was just admiring itself?
Don't remember if it was the chicken or one of the frogs in ordon
I wish that I can fly. Into the sky. So very high. Like a dragonfly
Chest, poe, and flying skulls. My faaavorite
@AnniLyn2 I want a milky way
You're gonna need that Phan what are you talking about lolz
don't worry I was making a reference only I would get
youtube search neil cicierga fly away
What if there are items in the rocks phanto274Smile
I think rocks? are the last thing they have to randomize in OOT/MM rando
yes what a blizzard of a bike ide and in time for endgame
Where were the booties and boomies?
@AnniLyn2 I really count on milky way
Let's eat a milky way...I'm a dragonfly
@seventyfourtg It's oddly fitting and idk why. It just makes sense
Okay so Phan...which is worse? Telma or spring water transport
It's the spinnies man...if I knew this was better I'd be doing it constantly
@AnniLyn2 that's the power of music for you
OK do it again but don't hug the cliff
I mean they can't anymore lolz
I just call them spinnies ever since ocarina
I tried avoiding them with the large quiver
74 now I got the song in my head...
Also Phan phanto274GL with the rest of this seed. I have high hopes for ending
i feel obligated to post that emote when I hear that song LUL
there is a trick im trying to learn for banjo cause its in logic and my last seen required it
how is the seed going RatSmoke
at least you'll be ready for vday with that amount of hearts
hey so that was horrible and I hated that jump
THIS CAVE GIVES ME ANXIETY OK
every time i watch snowpeak i want ice cream
i misheard the first time and thought you were calling this ass Luke and I was like 'he has a name??'
You should beat these randos faster
even closed captions thinks you're saying Luke
why do you have a pee sword
We taking bets on last item being the reward for all poes?
May as well pick it up, you're practically there 😏
Lets go to floor 50 then!
Honestly if I was that camera I would just cooperate
Are we seeing you at SGDQ???
no boss we don't want to see you explode
I have to get hot girl body tea ready first but I'll be there
Laiya said @ her, shes got you
this is a short glitchless run
I move home permanently and then it's go time
Make a pitstop in New Orleans first
Lai and I will drive you around :3
raw gatorade powder kind of tastes like lemonheads
wonder if i could turn this stuff into a hard candy by baking it
You know why you aren't in go mode already? Arbiters isn't required
what's standard WOTH for Hyrule Castle? 3 mirror shards, Sword, Boomerang, Wolf, Spinner, Shield?
i guess if you already know the boomerang pattern you don't need arrows. or maybe you can hit it with clawshot
this seed has it out for you
why does bro look like the joker
Argorok the dragon that takes one less damage
The purple and green is not the worst fit ive ever seen
I failed PC twice but I'm not even mad. I was pretty sleepy trying to run it
I'd be having a joker moment too if I dealt with this seed
Still looking for a spinner and a bedroom key
I want to do bomb boosts and LJAs
I don't want to do epona oob
Big fan of the gold MS
this game has so many jokes
Now that is a middle finger lol
because fuck you, i agree with ice
the real question is why didn't you have it earlier Kappa
yo fuck you glubbers, i mean what's up bud?
yo fuck you ice cmdrglWave hope you're well, i'm alright
about to subject myself to torture i mean learning new speedrun
Phantom: You're right, it was an empty threat :(
@TheGlubbers Im sure, totk? will ne fiiiiine
is there any game to speedrun that isn't torture?
if it were totk i would not be dreading it
Oh, wait I thought you'd done MM before
@Darkness3827 Celeste isn't that bad cause it's next to no RNG
don't you need some dumb bad controller for a specific angle
a hori, yeah i have mine plugged in
who pissed on your sword bro
ah i love looking at ace/srm bullshit
get on the top of the chest, drop the bomb in front of you, jumpslash on 7th red
0807BD23 3886A667 - 87Sはぁヲピセ - j 0x801EF48C i think part of this is a file name
thanks i made it myself (i did not)
what does each digit do exactly, you have 20 seconds
You see the piss sword is because it's something a dog would do
anything but that im a virgin
I thought for a second you were gonna say your mom was a virgin nozo KEKW
that would make me jesus christ
that would still mean my mothers not a virgin
there are some virgin fish that give birth
well mother is a lose term doesnt have to be biological
I have never wanted to go clean more than after watching something so cursed (it's this chat)
thanks I will (takes myself out in the trash)
most zelda streams are some form of cursed
phantom doesn't have to teach me that votes don't matter, thats why marie won the splatoon 1 splatfest
thanks for showing us how the void out works
he tried to be cool, but he never went to school
imagine getting your bomb snatched by a clam
I feel like this is a euphemism of some sort
its a euphemism for your mom
i will die if the hearts pop out and then the spinner
oh gods she does have painted toes
I'd love whoever gave me 100 dollars
an ad played before I could see what it was
I just got blue balled by twitch
and the tiny preview skipped ahead like 5 seconds
twitch is a professional blue baller
I wish someone would love me like yeto loves yeta tbh
I wanna be told "look into eyes of yeto"
sled race is the equivalent of Goron Races
Master Sword, have you been PISSIN' tonite ? ? ?
Lil Sword, lil Sword, you look so sharp I bet you could slice through my sorrow...
I remember when you were just here
And said "fuck that last chest"
i wish i knew how to do this
I hate arachnophobia like just let the spiders get married
would have been funny if there was a dominion statue in the ceiling for the last one that was like a giant shoe
where was spinner? I was trying to take myself out with the trash but the compactor was broken
is AMS decent to get into?
it looks appealing cuz its like an hour long
I like glitchless master sword but im still bad so its like 2 hours 40 mins
allot of the tricks I already know how to do I think
its just the speed running specific ones i'd have to learn
this is still my favorite boss music
I mean you literally did a jump strike that shit hits hard as fuck
im pretty sure 2 jump strikes would kill no?
can always also just do the mortal draw tech with midna
you interrupted her with your sword bruh
hit him with the pee sword
now that I think about it every phase of ganondorf has good music
I just like beast ganons the most
Beast ganon feels like the most honest iterations
the way it interacts with the portals is awesome
so you just look into the sky?
Honestly the laugh into the serious face is so iconic
Just shove your pee inside ganon
you were out of kick range
so link can just kinda turn into a wolf forever now, right
they don't tie that loose end up
(hi G i hope you're well)
But ganon wants you to try inserting your pee
is she streaming tonight? I thought she was off
Midna in true form kinda a baddie tho 😳
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day iceblueRaid
Good luck for your runs today 🤗
There he is 😁😁 lets gooo
is a yolo run any different from a normal all dungeon run
is this just done with more whimsy
Hey I made it to a stream on time  for once
what does this do, skip a cutscene trigger?
"maybe i could pull this out" joey pls
oh my god ofc it was beast
I don't know twilight princress how much of GM does that skip?
the game is 20 years old we cant keep discovering new nonsence like this
skips the maze, and one of the  elders, and the - yeah
So incredible in vanilla, Eh in rando since rando has fast iron boots
I'll probably just order the cards that I want
like i came here hungover minding my business and i learn new tp skip drops
this game is twenty years old this is ridiculous
one day i will have patience to learn how to do some runs for tp, but also, i dont want to
I'm also waiting for the quarter century stampede to come out to buy a few packs for the LUL
guess I joined at the perfect time to bring bad luck lol
You know a speedrun is fun to learn when a fucking rock can kill a run
gonna lurk for a bit in chat
Goats behaving for a change? We might actually have a shot at WR
ya know this also now fuckes with tp gltiched logic for rando
as aparently it can be done without ib
making no ib goron mines that much more doable
you can gate clip with wolf through that door, aparently
so yeah, still dont need IB for gm in rando i guess rip
iuts what theyre talking abt rn lmao
I didnt get what you are doing 😅
No audio cuz Im visiting fam but good luck NODDERS
I gotta get those reward points phanto274Mash
Is it just visual that you are carrying a shield and sword ?
it took me ten tries yesterday to get the kak watchtower alcove chest which is a trick i havent truggled with for motnhs,  its an off week clearly
Even the inventory is like at the beginning
I know nothing about this game so far 😅
that was robbed from you fr
Just helped a friend of mine with some dungeon quests many years ago
you know now that i'm M-F it's kinda freeing to be able to enjoy a day off knowing i have the next day off as well lol
"A little out of order" While having iron boots which some casual players don't get for like 3 hours
i mean, if you do 3 sequence breaks ina row
like, back in time, then sns skip, THEN early ms like
i dont think even the GAME knows wherew youre supposed to be rn
yep, we  jumped off a bridge for a change of clothes, jumped over another huy for weapons, and now we jumped through some other guys for a BETTER weapon AND the ability to shapeshift
i just got back w a bowl of pasta and all i heard was "how do i ghet edm" and idk if that was what i heard but5 all i could think off was why ar you tryingto get electronic dance music
my pasta is more el dente then id prefer and im sad abt it
interesting that provincial twilight doesnt auto transform you
oh damn you do this trick holy shit
i saw you hit the button???
the bane of tp running existence
i wanna thank you, becous i love Pm and see you with thes rando on yt or live, i enjo it and love it even more then ever before, i get to learn some tricks and gliches and is so mutch fun thank you Phantom
this trick sucks cuz if you fail it you have to wait to drain then go back down
just very annoying compared to failing any other trick
oh its probably a memory thing
we dont know why it works we just know it does
I need to do more glitchless runs '
I finally learned up to master sword
and then I like stopped running lol
now that I think about it, was this a banned trick in season 1
or was it just not worth doing
looking at deku toad through the wall
to get into the mini boss room
So mny tears. Like why so sad?
i see imp midna neuron activate
Game's called TWILIGHT princess for a reason
There's a lot of twilight and Link is the prettiest princess
shadow bug uses using double team its super effective
Finally made my order of cards so...
Some shining sarcophagus deck cards and sky striker
Can you skip the cutscene somehow?
Ah, seems like it takes some practice
look into yeto third eye. fly with wings of soul
They're polite, they'll wait for you to open the door
First dungeon of the category still the forest temple?
I believe the dungeon order is forest > spr > mines > lakebed > arbiter's > tot > city > palace > hyrule
I wonder what Midna thinks of Link just knowing about the mirror, before even assembling the fused shadow
my fav bingo check i have not been able to do  is look into eyes of yeto with a hawkeye
Wait, you can pick items up with the ball and chain? I did not know that
such a cool trick and it isn't even that hard
time for a huge bow gold
Goron mines is awesome, when you don't have to do the bad parts yeah
can you go back and walk on the ceiling for fun
my most hype moments in this game were when links boots electrify, and the ball and chain
also the old goron with the smoke coming out of him
Does the game only check the last piece of it?
thats very silly but thats what makes it so funny
do you REALLY need all 3 pieces or just the very important last piece
or doid allt he elders scramble for eachother to give to gor liggs befire you got there
Bad key design, if only one 3rd of it matters tbh
it saves on memory is probably why they did it that way
but they could have done a bitmask sooooo lazy devs???
and people said i was crazy for liking goron mines so much lmao
goron mines just shot up like 2 tiers on the dungeon tier list
I still liked goron mines before this trick but it's even cooler now
all thanks to the goron mines trick
"Hey wanna transform to a wolf?" "Yes" Midna immediately starts dying
she only had enough power for one last transform.
midna i know you're dying but can you stop breathing on my neck like that
man this place is really flooded
its paved which explains why theres no drainage
meanwhile jovanis house has severe water damage
thankfully he has enough money for repairs
And now to inject Midna with Triforce of Wisdom.exe
"Phew, that was a nice session of being on the brink of death, anyways"
Now your Midna has the ToW
what happened??? some sort of clip went bad or st?
do you think he says fuck you to Link in that scene
Nah, pretty sure he says "Eughhh"
I mean eughhh could be fuck you in boblin
maybe he didn't want Link to understand.
You know how people get *really* mad and they start speaking in their native tongue to cuss someone out?
he wanted to flaunt his multilingual capabilities in front of Link.
As a fluent bublin speaker I can confirm Eughh is a very long articulated insult that would take several paragrahs to say in hylian
yeah I always hate it when speedrunners skip my favorite cutscenes.
They should just let them all play out
I've been wonderin if I should have an option to subtract cutscenes from the total time and let people have their peebreaks when I take 5-6 years to finally make a game, like, as a speed option
How many games even still use in game time though?
Oh, I didn't know Okami did too
But Okami doesn't cut out cutscenes or loads I don't think
If I recall some Sonic games use it?
what is the main benefit of IG vs RTA?
I mean cutting out loads is the biggest part of IGT cause loads are dependent on hardware which differs from player to player especially on PC, it's just not very often games have it.
lots of PC games use autosplitters that pause during loading which gets around that issue for games that don't have IGT
it was at that moment, they knew: they fucked up
Guess Stalord got aHEAD of himself
Hey all! Hope ur valentines day went well! Just came home from Cap America. What an intellectual movie.
I abandoned my coworker to a mess of his own making. Hope he gets out on time.
I heard a part of the music you don't usually hear and instantly knew
Ugh, does Gohma look disgusting in this game
those are rupees not doll hairs
Whoa! You got 20 stinkin' rupees?
Where can I find a list of those community names
Okay, I know Hugo, but which one is Jamal?
Ah, I just call him the pro gamer
As in my current casual playthrough, one of the running jokes is that the shadow beasts are regular people Zant turned into gamers (derogatory)
I would also fuck right off if I had a dragon on my ass
is iron boots a safety strat or st in this fight?
Why do you think they called them Peahats and not Pisscaps
Did you do the new Goron Mines tech in this
I forgot it saves an hour an 20 minutes
Is it almost Zant o' clock?
Awsm time for sure now Max ur audio stream please
its pretty generous the game doesn't even make you restart the whole fight
i appreciate your spirit of learning approach
oh hey youre at a decent pace
surely this is 7 cycle Clueless
I am here. I missed a dungeon or two, please make sure I see all dungeons before ending the run please and thanks :)
This one goes all the way
how could points be pointless!? that's an oxymoron :P
Is there a skip for that
Dinner was fantabulous and for the first time ever i am happy tipsy. Hope u all been great.
I could possibly be wine drunk tonight
What was everyones over all thoughts on Red Hulk and Super saijin 4 being canon?
oh so u dont follow any of the mega anime. The one im most impatient for is Kaiju no 8
You want to know what I did with my free will today? I ate dessert before dinner
i think there was only ever 1 time i ate desert first and that was when i helped making the rice pudding that day
It was good! Hope the run is going well!
And loved that sound alert yammibYugiLaugh
Yeah! Haven't played through OG in quite some time, so revisiting it
lose 1 minute every attempt (+ however many seconds to rng)
my first all dungeons run ever spent 30 minutes on it because I was on the hard mindset of "don't reset first run"
I have to relearn pillar clip ugh
elh not viable in all dungeons I'm sad
ask and you shall receive lol
Isn't that cutscene like Zelda being like oh hi Link please help Ganon is fucking shit up.
bro was in the loading zone
you know what they should've given us in hyrule warriors?
shirtless sumo link as a costume too :P
if sephiroth gets to be shirtless in smash let link be shirtless in hyrule warriors :P
we should reset if we fail box breaker
those 2 frames are super important
so this AD route can only do wolf bombhouse skip huh
so you get eldin vessel, get a couple of the bugs, get the city cannon, then do boomerang and forest templle
then after forest you warp to kak and finish
yo gl Phantom and gg on the fat PB yesterday too
ohhh you finish it after zd portal
now I have an excuse to not learn wolf bomb house skip
yeah, i have to learn it first
kitty climb actually did not influence it
I wanted to get a 2:56 before doing AD
and it just so happened kitty climb got found the same day I got that time
I've already re-learned a few things that I did in glitchless (ookless and some tot stuff) but haven't done much
Anybody elses wind knocking out their power?
explosion so powerful it blew a hole in reality too
If you pb I'll stick that pillar up my asshole
To be fair I don't expect anything out of any run
No run is safe until Zelda is done
It also took me 18 years to realize rutela's theme is just a remix of serenade
wait till you hear about Windfall and Outset island, Pichu
I'm here to kill time till I have to clean off cars 😩
it's currently a wintry mix so I don't wanna do it if the car will just freeze over
Oh yeah I live in Canada's armpit
Pidgey do you live with Elsa or what the fuck
got a lot of snow up where I'm at that then changed over to rain so I had to get up at like 6 AM to clean it all before it became 200lbs from all the water.
we have like 2 and a half feet of snow on the back porch from the last few weeks
Omg you live in the Sonoran desert?
That's in like California I think
Oh actually it's mostly in AZ and Mexico but some of it is in Cali yeah. South of you though.
It's the Mojave Desert pretty sure.
Do you think if the bugs finished eating the light we would have seen some real gnarly creatures? You think they can do more than just grow?
clearly that means watching the cutscene is faster than skipping :P
I mean yeah it's right next to Lanayru so why wouldn't you go there next?
isn't it triple frame perfect technically cause you have to release A too right?
could be worse tho, could be 10 hours
I don't miss doing them remotely at all
Yall are fucked up from capitalism you know that? I wish u all a very good rest
luckily I think I'll get 3 days off this week
my hands are fucked up, fingers hurt when I touch stuff LUL
Look into Yeto eyes for free timeloss
this is like a studio ghibli movie setup
to find the divine beast within?
boy lost in the snowy mountains meets a yeti, snow slides down a mountain, and then hangs out with 2 yetis, 1 of them goes evil, gets saved, roll credits
i like Link Twilght's Pro Snowboarder, amazing game
pictured: me digging out the cars
nice rocket rolls up to the boss door
Isn't there a pot with hearts inside?
oh god I have to fight the chilfos with just b&c
no bomb arrows in this route...
The game really tried to kill you
it just feels so slow lol
she's totally not looking into his eyes in the slightest
I think the slash was angled too much to the right
how much time does this trick save?
it skips the first key shard and the long magnetic ceiling room
I think if you fail it the way you did it should only cost like 5 seconds if you don't jumpslash over the railing
for that one you actually don’t want to be super close to the edge it’s really weird
the closer you are to the edge the more likely it fails for literally no reason
i agree it’s not really clear at all
it's a thing you have to feel out
you should target while swimming up, it'll help you judge the height better
well, this is a bad screen to come in on
Have a good night see ya next stream.
not quite the same as NSMB
already almost done with the new trails game peepoSad
Is that a new skip? I thought you had to use LZS to get past the toads
so how does one define a "major" sequence break? phanto274Thonk
guess what i can say i happily match ur bed now. I got the mini starter evolution backpack from spencers/hottopic
are there any decent rpgs that have come out in the last few years
i feel like the last fun turn based rpg i played was bug fables
i want ni no kuni 3 or something man
i think i liked 2 more than 1
yeah the raid battles were kinda ass
i don't remember ni no kuni 2 that well
but i only beat it once
I didn't know they kept making vallyria chronicles games. I enjoyed the first one
Give me a break wait don't you'll invalidate the run
i always see 4 on sale for like 8 bucks
Don't threaten me with a good time Kaiba boy
This shall be it I believe!
Why are they named after him then?
Did he just start using them in runs first?
That was the run that got me into pape
Err actually i think it was 2015
And then I went back and watched pie's run
Pape pretty much is kicked out of gdq
I really love Malleo's TTYD TASes
I want more TASes at GDQs
Speaking on Tases how pumped are u for the mm reveal this weekend?
true dat when beest and green suigi are the human tasbots themselves
awsm start but alas gotta head out for some errands.
So I just checked my Highlight count recently.... frick
I may or may not have to move 600 Hrs of stuff to my SSD
Same, it's just slow going on my end
How've you been? Haven't check in with a busy month at work
My Highlights are more of a "Let's Stream" series for a few games. Those are the ones really jamming up my storage. Literally >100 hours of that is just Star Trek Online
(Highly recommend, great story, no paywalls for it)
Also it'd be nice if Twitch could prep more than 3 VODs at a time
I plan on DLing and reuploading later, don't have a VOD channel yet on YT
That's on my to-do list too
oh i had 90s of delay lol
I liked it but never played anything that used it lol
nah i paid 7tv for prety name plate
Omg it’s a Phantom stream LETSPAPERMARIO
I’ll hold your beer while you save time dw
We need to have a talk if you're cheating on minors Stare
Hey mid, how's hell I mean master duel
I haven’t played since our matches KEKW
Same, I got into zzz and I can't stop
As a kid I counted emerldShrug
But also I had to count postman because it was fucking 2003
Toad is throwing for content Madge
You sound like it’s time for tequila
do you have to charge the belly flop
I only ever did all cards
i have it on my pc lol
all of mine i at least have a recording of still on my pc
i'll start cleaning everything up for me personally soon
if no one else does maybe i'll archive wrs
i just need to have enough hd space lmao
sorry was distracted is this for gless
i have no idea what this routes coins are lol
yeah would just need to time everything lol
idk how fast fire flower fight is
idk what a good ch1 time is with glitches
or if fright jars could be used and it becomes like glitchless beginning
yeah im sure spook helps a lot
Good luck on this attempt ukyotpPray
i feel like 4 is more rare then the others
cool that you can play the game solely on muscle memery
yo lopez ty for the gl
What if you didn't use logic in your argument
but then you can still cut corners
yo plant ty for the gl
yo phantom ty for the gl
that's so hard to do lol
also sonic racing crossworlds is fun as fuck
obviously some stuff may change in the final release but what they have now is incredibly solid.
the ffz effect makes it look extra evil lmao
You gotta pick up slow go instead
if you 5th try speedy then?
also you get to customize the color of your car, and since you can't overlay stickers on each other i just made my car trans flag colored (and the cockpit ace flag colored lol)
last thing i'm gonna say about crossworlds: Cream just bobs her head back and forth and it's adorable and it's also like how i feel. i'm just there to have fun lol
Aaah ok, makes sense (i think)
I'm pretty new to the whole mario speedrun shtick but i can guess why people don't like all bosses
Yknow, despite my incredibly big mario interest, I've never finished a paper mario game, i heard they're good tho, like the best mario story games out there or something
nmg is just dont use srm
one more week til monster hunter releases :D
one more week until i dont play monster hunter still
Pillar clip is actually gonna make me rage quit TP phanto274S
It should be to me which is the rage inducing part lol
so I can suggest a speed run with channel points right
what if I also Ask you to race me in said speed run I suggest
is TP on the list Kappa
I was gonna ask if you wanna race a glitchless master sword some point was all
if you wanna do post master sword then I'd just have to learn the route
its only 3 hours if you're bad trust
that was my second run of it though
I would choose any other speed run but I dont know any other one
I cant say "lets race any%" cuz I cant fucking do shield sword skip
and also pillar clip is trash
@nozomup yeah it is making me crash out lmao
How is my son Agumon doing
And how is your son Gomumon doing
this category is more like adr i think
When are you going to accept my 1v1 challenge in Digimon Rumble Arena 2 for Nintendo GameCube Phantom gminus1Mad
i thought touching the buttons was good
Why do I need to look away?
@Gay_Plant i know you from bsky phanto274Wave
I didn't just download the visual novel Euphoria because I'm a coward
I wanna give him a hug
How does Watt talk with a pacifier in her mouth
that was an amazing outing and what an eppy
....did we just teach you that
@LunaAmethyst my toddler does it all the time
I will never get over the screaming Shy Guys
I wonder what Skolar's eyes look like under his glasses
That would be horrifying and hilarious
Yeah, try shocking the being literally MADE of electricity
Muskular....and he doesn't look physically different from the others body wise
LMAO I got off the phone with my friend and didn’t realize I had your stream going still. those noises confused tf out of me
Muskular flexing would be like that one close up image of SpongeBob trying to flex
Is this the really bad thing you mentioned earlier?
Gourmet Guy implies that Shy Guy masks are part of their flesh
Unless he magically got a new mask
how do you keep b held down
Muskular has cool older brother energy
I like how this game really feels like a team effort from Team Mario and Team Peach
i dont remember if you were apart of the conversation, but when mark ran pape, i used to hold the b button down, becasue we didnt know about the unplug thing. and i got the nickname the clamp
Bombette's different colors in the randomizer just make me think of different gumball flavors
and there was a point where i said i was going to run pape and beat marks place on the leaderboard and arie said "THE CLAMP WILL SURPASS IT'S MASTER"
I had a thought a bit ago
last minute I decided to join season 4
If you destroy a place with lava, does it count as arson
I dunno if lava can activate things that aren't flame resistant
I assume not, cuz it's heat
I think arson involves setting fire to something with the intention of causing damage, and lava wouldn’t generally fall under that definition unless human actions caused it to affect property in such a way.
Yeah, was thinking of that scenario
If by some bs someone had enough lava to spill on a whole building
Man, can't believe Kolorado's fuckin dead
I assume that damage is for Peril strats
Unless it's otherwise crucial to burn Mario to a crisp for the run
The captions turned that whole thing into a command for specifically me
People figured out how to access training mode in the fatal fury beta already lol
The functionality is in the damn beta you just can't access it so you hover over the tutorial and change the value by 1 number and it clicks training mode lol
I have no fucking clue why they limited it
So they specifically put tmode in here LOL
I got bored very quickly in tmode tho the combos are mad boring in this game
You just learn what ex string to use in order for each button and there's nothing else
Any technicality is in the parrying
And I dont like parries kazamsCatglub
Oh yea I suppose it would make more sense than her still LOL
I'm really starting to feel how the game was rushed out though but overall it's been fun
looks scarier than it is for sure
Compared to standard Mario, Paper Mario is a bit shorter
Woa G is as super as mario
one more fp would be nice lol
I hope mwsf games list gets decided soon
I gotta plan my spring lol
Yea esp for you who needs to fly out here
If I dont need to hotel there I'm gonna try to get to the seven spires concert in chicago at the end of may instead if I can figure out someone to go with
I love how unreadable the dizzy emoji is on the overlay
is the pb on YouTube i can go check real quick
Will the King give us a run?
oh god this fuck ass attack
i legitimately forget up and away existed
my all cards pb dinked on the front ghost :)
I'm excited for potential project in pipe line
it'll only be a go if I can get the twist to work
bought powdered pigments that change colours with heat
so end goal will be for plush, but it'll be so much cooler with context of character
I just need to see if I can paint pigment onto fabric and do overall experimenting
because idea won't work with out it
and now time to drop some mlp related context
oh thank god it was done already
because of course its a mlp plush LUL
i remember playing this on my eee pc at like 5 fps back in like 2010
you got two characters Cadence and Chrysalis. Chrysalis is a shapeshifter, she has taken the guise of Cadence.
and the setting is it's Cadence's Wedding.
Anyways Cadence has purple eyes, Chrysalis has green eyes. Throughout the episode "Cadence's" eyes flash green *audience hint that something is not right here*
is this the all cards turbo charge fight or is quick change a thing here
my success rate in all cards is literally 100% but also like 5% in glitchless so
So the plush will be of "Cadence" but wait, no it's not! It's Chrysalis disguised as Cadence. Because the eyes will change from Purple to Green with heat
what is this, like 4 turns without them
i think that was max length
it's like 2 to 4 turns im pretty sure, felt like 4
i think he is likely to shield on the turn you outta sighted
solid full look see  of the game
i stopped counting after 2 cuz that's just bad
but since he delayed boots again it might not have mattered
Turns out my last cards that I ordered a while ago will probably arrive after this weekend for some reason
I will still have to order a couple for one of my 3 decks
just made an omelet, working on oatmeal
Turns out one of the card stores near me has a good stock of things I needed
Magic, Yugioh and Pokémon all in this store
what soundtrack is this song from?
Longest VG song I know of off the top of my head is like 11 minutes. I'm sure there's plenty longer ones tho.
just sub 4 this stream, this run, rn
I fucking hate trying to practice tp and gz just not fucking working
I keep loading it and it's just not functioning
i cant do the button combo to get the menu up
there should be a "no tricks that suck ass" category for all games :D
Let Phantom5800 know you want to drop in and collaborate!
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
I have to basically do the route to practice sword and shield skip lul
you know what nvm fuck this shit lol
this is why I dont run glitched categories
I was doing sword and shield but its fucking dumb and annoying
im already aggravated cuz of gz not working and not only do you have to do this trick you also have to do another stupid trick right after it
it feels pointless to do as a beginner
lose 50 minutes to two hard tricks back to back
look i tried for the charmy
work was very boring today but at least I had funny blowjob cucumber to laugh at
And now I get to open tomorrow kazamsCatglub
I think I'd get fired if I tried them out
I always thought his design was a little too weird
Boy does he make good soup though
Just in the nick of time !yank
including everyone's marathon runs. Had to cancel my usual movie outing to see Dogman for it.

Did u look into the new epic clip find for this place?
I thought hitting the cutscene always pushed you off
tfw i remember i can add emotes
you should post it in the tp discord
i gotta delete some emotes on my 7tv
L E T S G O R O N
feli my light blinked three times. what does this mean.
are you performing sorcery on my house
i was playing mario eclipse instead
honestly the best fish game ive played isn't even a proper fish game
its streetpass mii plaza's ultimate angler
i keep having dreams about an ex who wasn't really my ex
i was wondering what you were trying to do that clip is insane
i love people who do that
its just like lost woods and the spirit  tracks overfield theme
someone reuploaded animal crossing 5pm and just called it their own song
youtube copyright is really dumb, twitch too lol
i tried to report things like that on youtube, but only the original copyright owner can do that apparently lol
just gotta send nintendo an email with the youtube video
i had a crush on someone i used to work with who just went into intimate detail about their bf experience and it broke me
not sure how to resolve my feelings so they disappear from my dreams
yeah i almost wish bark was its own button because like if you're not frame perfect you have to hear midnas weird moans
you can mash but its a specific rhythm
i probably wouldn't mind as much if she had alternate sounds
but its always the same sound
How's being a furry for 5 hours?
did they change it from a chest at the last minute
i was watching brianmp16 do a rando and he needed milk in the gibdo house but the cow gave him magic jar instead it was a meme
How's the run? I see green
Wait say what? Is this glitched?
I'm on my phone so I can't really see the words on screen
Something is missing...like a lot -.-
I think you were slightly too diagonal
Can you create save states for practice?
Yeah analog glitches and delays fucking suck man
also yes, its waaay too stiff for what its meant to do
yeah the GC dpad is like made for ants it's way too tiny
my dream is a modular GC controller like the xbox has but it would easily be 300 usd
with swappable N64 / GC / sony parts
i got the switch wireless one that uses batteries but its not 1:1 with the original shape and the triggers aren't analog
also I don't like the c-stick on the GCC for any game outside of smash tbh.
the c stick is alright for sunshine
I just want dpad to have the option to be buttons not only for n64 but for rhythm games and gba
At this moment it's just completing it?
it'd be a bit late for a 2nd run unless it's something else that's short.
just enough time for kuru kuru kururin
I did an entire speedrun without realizing the B button made you go faster
I was like god how are these guys so fast i suck ass
this is easily the worst dungeon room
I made it for Zantboi LETGORON
do you think midna ignored her job on purpose so she could have some time with this fine hunk of man
he says that he picks the stronger side
idk if thats true actually lmao
so maybe he works for link after he defeats ganon
“Fuck off… thanks for the arrows” KEKW
I got my sub 3:10 finally Phantom NODDERS
imagine if the white cat was with them
or the entire horde of cats
nice i just hit 900k points
nah the cat jumps up and solos all of em
Holy fuck tiger are you sharing with the class
Ggs on fulfilling your furry journey
my furry journey is never over
urooglGG silent1053GG avarie1GG phanto274GG marcoWin tippiWin
three people pb'd in tp today
Omg you don’t have LETSGORON Sadge
oh wait ganon says it's not over :P
Nah I’m gonna play yugioh KEKW
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I was about to say glubbers not on so it’s a hard choice lol
Again waiting for a few cards to come in before I purchase more cards
gl on the run i am lurking
my friend hit affiliate today so i am hanging out over there
I still have yet to play TP and I want to so bad!! but finding a physical copy is so hard and expensive!
kicking myself for loosing my copy of tphd
still have the midna amiibo tho
@Cowbungo101 friend, have you heard of the wonder world of emulation ? ? ? ?
yar har a pirate is thee
OH, A PIRATE'S LIFE IS A WONDERFUL LIFE
@buff00n ya i know i know but I really want a physical copy of this game and WW :P
I wish you luck, mate. People charge crazy $ cuz they can.
people charge crazy $ bcuz crazier people out there will PAY that $
Hey Phantom when can we expect a Low% run of this game? cowbunEyes cowbunStraw cowbunNana
Wolf Link with the Hylian Shield on his back goes foolish
What was your PB last night?
Nah Jamal needs to be better MadgeRn
Thats really unfortunate. I hate EMS
Ofc you get it as soon as you reset it always happens
It’s hot as balls in my apartment. feels like summer now that we’re in the positives again KEKW
i wonder if link is a fan of limp bizkit. keep rollin rollin rollin rollin
Nothing wrong with a 4:40 cage break Sadge
Guys is it just me or has this month been like crazy long? and there’s only 28 days in it KEKW
oh no. how are you going to make up those 10 secs
How is it only the 23rd
what do you mean february? its 9 jan
Hey is it safe to download gamecube roms in the sense of internet companys and whatnot?
how is it ALREADY the 23rd
@stalkor I would cry if it was still January
@Midnaliin I'll add onto that that last month also felt comically long. This whole year is dragging
@L1nk2001 thats not something we can discuss on twitch
@L1nk2001 Piracy is a crime and crime doesn't pay :P
I know! It feels like it should be at least mid March
ahhhh very bad dont do it
try having a baby. time is just a fleeting thought
I own them its just in a storage unit SadgeCry
I don’t want any babies anytime soon KEKW
why do you need to talk to him so many times is it just that he goes through all of the required dialogues up to that point?
i wonder if ganon and that wrestle guy are related
Who knows, maybe they are work buddies
hey he could be albino gerudo
Then again, Ganondorf is green. Also not the skin tone of other gerudo
a lot of ganon portrayals turn him into a moster with similar fangs to bo beau ehh wrestle guy
I mean he was also green in other games that do have gerudo
Woah that's actually pretty cool so she doesn't show up
i wonder if that could happen
The jump before scene or the pile up?
why are you calling justin hugo?
Oh yeah it happened to me sometimes
Game had to balance it out somehow I guess
Mr Phantom, I humbly request that you get another PB, especially now that I am here to see all the dungeons correctly this time
Its confusing to me bc people will say “oh Jamal is guaranteed to give you a slow one within 3 swings” and I took that advice and also ended up dying cuz it was 3 fast swings
It really is so RNG which is annoying
D: Phantom you can't just target kids
@Zeliversal idk, after what he did in Majora's mask, I think it's reasonable
@zeliversal you can...just gotta get them ice cream after they cry
A person of culture and class
How does rare even taste? Like I know medium rare is chewy, medium is stuck in teeth, and anything after that is rubber
Or less, depending on your vantage point
It is more cooked or less rare
true gamers eat the cow while it's still standing :)
Madge Don't tell Midna to shut up
those loud MOOOO are the best
I just never got to find out because I've never heard anyone say they like rare
@OhHeyItJaye Truer gamers eat the cow before it's even born. Now THAT'S rare
I believe in the mid game time save NODDERS
nah, eating the cow before it's born
No gotta eat the cow when it was planned out
Gotta eat the first atom to ever exist, as that could at some point become a cow
You gotta be careful about that lilly...you could accidentally become a cannibal
Damn, I hate rng when it comes to steak
isn't technically everything the first atom to ever exist
@AnniLyn2 Yeah, I don't mind, just another name to add to the collection
@thebloodlilly nobody has called you lil?
I busted a nut on Nancy instead LMAO
Can that be added to the quotes? Lolz
oh I didn't know VIPs could do it too
lemme find exactly what you said PrideLaugh
I’m gonna add all the quotes when I redeem VIP (in the nursing home in 60 years)
I got mixed up with another format PrideLaugh
I checked the clip, it was just a green
yeah I think the lighting just made it look yellow-ish
I swear this tree is so lenient until it comes to the run smh
Diababa throwing a tantrum before dying
The bot is very upset today KEKW
60% of the time, it works every time
Bot having a breakdown and then wishes death
I practiced that for hours yesterday so I have it down more now KEKW
You were too far from the pillar
Like as you were going down
I felt that sarcasm from here
How did you go into the miniboss like that wtf
Uhh I can try lol. so basically in forest temple you do BITE which is back in time equipped. this lets you get early boss flags which gives you not only the monkeys early to do Ook but it allows for the deku toad to be there early. so you can enter from the exit
it’s kind of confusing especially cuz I’m not good at explaining stuff KEKW
My brain cannot comprehend the words that are being written there but i think i understand it
Ohh that’s right I explained any% smh
I barely understand the howling stone stuff for AD
No I mean how it all works out for EBF lmao
Can you at least tell me what ebf stands for...
Why did my brain thought epic British food
Early boss flex more like Kappa
And I just reread the exp..
bdsm sounds like a fun trick
if you're into that sort of thing
what did I just enter into
You're participating in it too Zeli, you're literally using caps in some of the words you're typing
Glubbers named it BDSM (not surprisingly)
.... I'm sorry what does BDSM have to do with TP ? ? ?
I don't think you should use your wii in bed @annilyn2
@AnniLyn2 for a sec I thought this was another TP category :P
I see. Well, carry on, I suppose
@cpapumisterioso1503 no but someone can use their wii
@darkness3827 you do sometimes need toilet paper afterwards so..
Dry my uh...tears for the spring gods
@cpapumisterioso1503 Unfortunately this is the GC version :(
can you do BDSM on the Wii?
If you try hard enough yeah
yeah whoever thought having enemies where you can't leave 1 alive was a good idea should be docked like a week's worth of pay
bro flew across the galaxy for that kill
yeah phantom when you goin back to the ruins?
What is wrong with me and KB3. good thing I’m practicing cuz bro hit me again KEKW
I am being way too slow but I was too stubborn to back up and have it be slow
you accidentally turned on grass-sanity clearly so all the rupees got shuffled elsewhere.
me when phantom made grass sanity early
Gonna lurk but GL with the rest phanto274Mash
I wonder what the hold back is on it
I assume they have to rework the way logic currently works to fit the tricks in
I mean there's no rule against us just making them ourselves
and I doubt they'd be like "oh you're doing the work for us oh nooo stop that"
I could ask and look into it
I have a local version of the generator too
so I could probably do full blown testing
I still have 1.2 generator locally
My program is doing something completely unexpected and I don't know how or why or who
I do know what and when
is it a good unexpected or a bad unexpected?
In terms of program's objective and outcome? Good. In terms of understanding the impact of changes? Bad.
I should find a game to learn to speedrun but idk what. The problem is I don't like learning glitches and I don't like menuing and I don't like going fast. :P
my favorite snowboarding sequence in any zelda game
i mean, arguably shield surfing down hebra in BotW/TotK is just as much of snowboarding :P
whenever you jump off the stairs in the first room I always think you messed up but then I remember LUL
Ok... this problem is even more confusing now
fuckin this church ass room up
Why do they have a church in their house?
So it's not the source of the data. Because I tested converting from each other, and I get exactly the same results. One format causes one output, the other format causes the other. But if not the data, and the logic should otherwise be identicial why am I getting different results NotLikeThis
Phantom you know a thing or two
What devil did my witchcraft of a code make a deal with?
Madge I'm gonna be angry if it was Zant
No code in my house makes a deal with Zant
the code looked into the eyes of yeto to create true beauty clearly
ACTION looks into reflection, sees self
Well that was a f'ing lie
let me tell you a story.   *leaves*
link's biggest weakness, tiny changes in elevation
how much money do you need for the whole game?
i still technically have a few to get but those are guaranteed
no Bo gold but at least Bow gold.
current challenge league board had an achievement from it so i figured why not, set isn't that bad overall
I keep thinking it's gonna be a gold and then remember there's 50 minutes of dialogue after you kill a boss.
well at least you get 45 rupees back
cept for the beautiful eyes of Yeto we gotta have extra time to look at those.
what in the upwarp happened there? lol
is this the mario sunshine boss where you clean its teeth
closing in on sub 4 sum of bests
who keeps that many pots up there???
they're kinda asking for them to get knocked over tbh.
In Link's defense he's not really used to being a wolf, it's prolly pretty tough to learn how to run on 4 legs instead of 2.
ive been lurking and listening the entire timebut the HEWOO i needed to comment on lol
I give this ladder a 4/10
i found a new way to run Battle Network in archipelago
this ladder is getting a 10/10 tho it's just fuckin majestic.
I took the 4.5 box art for AP
Ok. I have eliminated up to a certain part of the code as the source
This is extremely confusing and slightly painful
what are the aspects that make a bad rando?
banjo tooie rando will eventually get a version not archipelago so ive been trying to learn checks cause we wont have auto tracker for that
If the prologue was important it'd still be in the armaturelouge
emerald on hardware is huge for me
idk what games make sense to be AP only, I guess stuff that doesn't make sense as a solo rando but idk how many games couldn't work solo.
Like i see games on gamecube id like to run but it doesnt work on hardware
Like Id like to try luigis mansion at least once
then I see I need to install dolphin and i get turned off by that
Like I've played the Jak 1 rando on AP, idk if I'd ever play it solo but I'm sure it's not the worst game ever for a rando.
i have nothing against emulation, people can play however they want. For me its more, my original hardware should be able to run it so im not going out of my way for dolphin
I know i havent been around much, have you returned to GCN retro achievements?
i know my prime is in your queue
enemies that freeze you randomly, another game design decision that should definitely cost someone a few $.
enemy design in TP is pretty good ngl
yeah cept for the redeads and the ghost rats and the shadow beasts
oh and ball and chain guy is another annoying dude mechanically.
yeah true it's more the room than him on his own.
No, but my teachers sure used to think that's why we owned them
That's why I haven't died yet
I almost bought a running shoe yesterday called Novablast
that sounds both extremely painful and also some new hip chiropracty practice
cause I bought a different brand online FeelsBadMan
Hey, that's Demise's gimmick from Skyward Sword!
you take that spike outta your head stallord
People hated on it more when it came out
i didn't like the sailing portion of it myself
Wind waker was also pretty hated on when it came out cause of how cartoony it was afaik.
crazy that WW only has like, 4 dungeons. 5 if you count Forsaken Fortress
@Darkness3827 most brutal Ganondorf death tho
just played the new Sonic Racing
fav 2D Zelda's between Minish Cap and ALtt
don't trust anyone who tells you OoT is the best Zelda
i'm of the controversial opinion that zelda is just an overrated franchise
I mean there's only OoT, MM, WW, TP, SS, BotW, TotK right?
BotW and TotK are fine, but they're not what I want / expect from Zelda
@buff00n then what is the best
WW was the only zelda game i could actually finish\
SS was okay but only after it came out on Switch
ofc its a real question LOL
I don't like MM but I feel like that's a me specific thing lol.
every other one i played just bored me to death and that includes BOTW
@Darkness3827 MM is polarizing and I get it
if you just deleted the timer MM might be my fave game tbh lol.
im gonna say the funny phrase
okay but did you get hit in a fast way
I believe in golds from here on out NODDERS
taking damage to save time, the speedrun way
I can’t believe it’s been that long already phanto274S
how is the AD, treating you. looks pretty good over the last few days based on the splits I saw
No way, I can’t believe you have time save on shitty in the sky BatChest
Does any runner like this dungeon?
Okay so it’s just you and Justin lmao
Guessing it’s way more fun with glitches then?
What does that do? keep the fan from turning on?
Okay this looks way more fun than glitchless
no dealing with helmasaurs left right and centre and skipping gaps easily
do you have to deal with the peahat room glitchless or nah? I feel like that's the worst room of the dungeon at least from a boredom perspective lol.
So the reason is because I'm doing a math check, to see if a value is equal to or less than X value, right?
I meant to pour coke and rum but I wasn’t thinking and poured coke and tequila KEKW this should be interesting
The integer math sees: 6351 <= 6351. So that's true...
The floating math sees 63.510000000000005 <= 63.51 which is false
That's where my bug is coming from
And this is exactly why I switched to integer math YEP
And now I'm debating do I run a quick patch on the floating point to see if I get the same results now
yeah this might as well be a different game
if it's not frame perfect it's a trash run
Link why tf do you jump off when he falls to the ground instead of just stabbing him 30 more times, this fight would be so much quicker if you did that...
Uhm. I'm not sure exactly what type of answer you're looking for
But I'm going with a pursuit enemy
Ngl I literally never made the connection to it being a floormaster KEKW
I always thought of them in context of Phantom Zant
but if we played it Who Wants to be a Millionare style, I might have selected an incorrect option
I was just like "Uh... Hand.. Phantom Zant... Zant... Hand"
If I had just played Wind Waker or something with a floor master *maybe* I would see what you're talking about
I was racking my brain and couldn’t remember what floor masters and wall master were called lmao
my brain was like, what are the red and blue hands called Hmm
All those small keys and Zant couldn't even invest in a shut-in lock
was doing some ac wild world speedruns
yeah ig locking things is more common in the twilight realm
got some solid attmepts but nothing spectacular
it's broken af, make town, do chores, do ACE, get money, finish chores, pay off debts
i've got a lot of games in the works atm, hard to focus
Bonking into that wall being faster threw me the first few times
wow bro hits like a truck
I think I can work on that spreadsheet after I come back from FF 👁️
It's mostly something I'm v interested in so I'd be more than happy to assist
Also been busy as hell this week swifFlop
Lead up to FF always keeps me busy
Gonna level with u, being dead kinda sucks ngl
Also high key waiting for the comfy friends eevee to drop in the us
I know you were eyeing the espeon lol
eh, depends, is zelda gonna steal some from you for the horseback section?
I thought the announcement was a cheap viewers message ngl
I saw one earlier in another stream lol
When King Bulblin does more than Beast Ganon GIGACHAD
I mean he is the King
Swift I broke my code but it's okay because then I fixed it and now it's not as broken
Yeah Ganondorf definitely isn't king enough
my hand was not in the right spot
someone redeem yugioh i don't have enough points
Not Good Ganondorf. He was never good. He was always evil
I have one for every game
TP is DG. WW is SG. OoT is different SG. SS is DD
bad boi for pbing punishment ensues
tuffy is not racing but ukyo is
Hey hey GL for runs. How are you feeling this day ?
@blacktiger51 my man, wuz poppin' Yo
@buff00n chilling man what's up with you
also chillin' I should go get some water, but I don't feel like leaving the house atm
and for pape plando are some traps ok? i have some funny things plans
@blacktiger51 Did you see Phantom's plans? :P
@Darkness3827 no KEKW i been playing trails through daybreak 2 and done now so back more
check the randos channel in the discord lol
yeah it's not really a rando if you know where everything is
only way would be if you made it then like waited 10 years to play it so you forgot everything
I'm gonna start cooking 1 so redeem coming in like a week maybe
i do have to make sure my logic works
yeah but i am gonna plando everything
so turn everything on and hope for the best NOTED
every badge is 10 BP and every move is 75 FP challenge run :P
hope the page saved cuz this gonna take a few days
idk I think having it and then seeing how absurdly expensive it is is funnier. Especially if it's like the first pick up LUL
ooh starting with power bounce! wonder how much it costs? Sees costs. *weeps*
ok i am not that evil
999 cost Speed Spin in toad town shop
oh nice i can plando bosses
hmm maybe no dungeon er then
wonder if shops item that cost like 11 coins works
it let me put a trap in the shop i doubt that work KEKW
I think I'm a tad behind
I'm probably not but it feels like it
I wonder if its possible to just do the intro normally and then do ems
maybe I should just learn 100%
I mean I dont have to do any of that in glitchless either
but Im only doing master sword runs
damn he fucked that rock up
I had to head out...my grandma called
You have one thing go right and the rest give you a finger to the face
I fucking hate when I get one wrong move with Bo and everything is just going downhill
currently playin b3313, noticed I should actually sort my notes, and uhhh
200 lines to still sort in, each being separate "this goes there" lines 😅
i have a new keyboard and mouse cause i was having issues with the old one
SM64 mod, lots of beta content and a bit of stanley's parable
just some basic logitech ones, nothing fancy. i just need functional lol
what was your old mouse doin?
Let’s get those peanut butters phanto274Mash
the mouse was doubleclicking on its own, and the keyboard was starting to have stuck keys
stuck keys suck, but nothin ya couldnt clean if ya feel like it
i could clean it, but it was also old and some letters were worn off
all my mice have so far broken down w double / no left or right click issues
after about a year of that, I then usually give in
currently on a G502 cus it was dirt cheap
the doubleclicking was mostly my fault, i'm too fast with cookie clicker lmfao
new mouse is a G203 i think
Cookie clicker, destroyer of mice everywhere
he just has restless leg syndrome, okayh
i'm gonna keep typoing til i get used to this new keyboard methinks lmao
@Mirby_Studios I broke my left click with uhhhh.... minecraft I think last was the case
then had that mouse for another 3 years and just lived with it as much as it was shit
@Mirby_Studios if it fits the budget, a G305 I think is not bad either?
I always get keyboards that go first, my standard keyboard has pretty nasty chatter
dunno if that one's wired or not though, depending on what your preference is
my requirements were cheap, wired, and has back/forward buttons on the side
my last keyboard was done cus it was ghosting my inputs
i saw this one and went for it lol
either not or double sending letters nasty like (wireless)
I think my model was like, Logitech g pro wired? It's fantastic
my current one is shit, is a handmedown which I need to get rid of
yeah that's another reason i replaced the keyboard, who knows what's in there that i failed to clean up over the years lmao
some keys get stuck cus of the previous user, sometimes it decides not to properly type or eat words for some odd reason
I should probably do a deep clean of my keyboard, might help with some of the chatter
cleaning keyboards easy though p4ntzThink just gotta get all keycaps off then you could literally (ofc power cable if wired properly sealed from fluids) throw it in the dishwasher lmfao
then let the thing dry out for like a good... hour or so, more if its not dry around so the water properly can rinse out by means of time
better ofc if ya do it with IPA, though then you're doing it manually
that's a bit too much for me lol
Yeah no ill stick with the isopropyl
it's hard enough for me to have the energy to wash actual dishes i ain't gonna do all that for a keyboard lmao
meanwhile I have done that a COUPLE times just with a basic brush
took all keycaps off, dusted the thing out
I have too many memes to send all the time
and the keycaps you can 100% throw in the sink with soap water
that sounds like a lot of work when i could just not lol
its literally like 10 minutes tops PrideLaugh
worse then 10 minutes for takin the keycaps off is puttin them back on
it's the process that i can already tell would set my back issues off lol
hell hear me out mirby: you more of a "cheap keyboard" or a "maybe mechanical" person w keyboards?
curious since w mechanical keyboards you usually also get key pullers
like i said i just need functional
tldr though: those key pullers you push onto the key, then pull off tippiTap
I made the switch back to mechanical, I do love my keyboard
also a bit of a reason as to why I am like "oh its easy"
cus while I am on membrane rn, I do have the key pullers
cus FUUCK breaking a keycap PrideLaugh
I want like. The noise level of red but the clickiness of brown
Reds are quiet and for speed
for me browns would be the way to go honestly
I write a lot so like. STIMULATION
blues are lighter then reds yea? I got that color scheme right in my head?
It prolly does exist but gl finding anything but like the four big switch types these days
wanna say ya can see it disappearing at least?
like dark grey pufts of wind when ya swing the lantern?
yea the hitbox always is a bit shit w that mist last I recall
Oh I've never seen that glitch
why did my brain think you were doing glitchless
link with his detachable spine on horseback KEKW
I wish we got to see this fight later in the game
It feels weird pacing wise here
so how and what does back in time affect KEKW
this looks sooo cursed to my brain in terms of what when where 🤣
more like "oh look its back in time"
If you're not fucking with flag states to do things in convoluted manners, is it really a Zelda speedrun
@FatPidgeyBirb you mean, an Action adventure speedrun? CorgiDerp
cus I could swear if it wasnt for EXP being technically present in Pape, you do a LOT of that in there too
Oh, you absolutely do it in some pape speedruns too
Outta curiosity, would bow fuck up this fight
Oh, so it doesn't softlock it or anything
bomb arrows would save a couple seconds over ookless
but for the route it's not faster
you'd have to 2 trip forest temple
I'm always intrigued by programming choices
it'ss ok it's not humanly doable
Ye, he's been dabbling in oot too I think
hey i have a defeat ganon time before i met her Kappa
Speak of the morp and he shall appear
back when defeat ganon was boomer ganondoor
bit sad that you still gotta do these three things here
you need to clear it in any% because you need the rock that spawns in death mountain to unthaw ZD
and lanayru needs to be done to access the desert
but I am surprised no one has found OoB to get to snowpeak yet
but yeah there's no known way to start lanayru twilight without clearing eldin first
you can get to snowpeak during lanayru twilight
this game was 30, not 60 right?
then at least its "lenient" but yea
this evening was watching a donk seed I redeemed, "Kremling Kapture" find fiary camera and take pics of all 36 enemies. It sounds cool and fun but once you get the camera its just a rush and isnt that interresting. Still cool they made a mode out of it.
it just lacks depth, so after the 3rd time youve seen everything it has to offer
@Axl_SR sounds to me like stray fairy hunt in MMR p4ntzThink
except with MMR, you would then still need to figure out where your fairies are since you can shuffle them about and while the fountains tell ya where region wise, the list of things it can be depending on depth of shuffle can be steep
yeah, explore level looking for camera, then revisit those levels all over again
its a neat gimmick by sound
also there are some enemies that cant be shuffled like the books in the castle library
makes for more variety in RSL type stuff
yeah, the gimmick is really cool in concept
just needs to be tinkered with by sound to create interesting itempools out of it rly
it doesnt get much play tho so I cant see it getting much updates honestly
did I hear I should tell someone about that setting if they didnt already see it axl? KEKW
I know someone who loves silly settings
and it just so happens they also do like DK64
OOOOR you gently nudge keiper towards it tippiGiggle
sure why not, for me I knew it was a setting that ive seen no one do so I just wanted to see how it played
all just depends on if ya find ppl who want to play x setting to get x setting to maybe get updates
and IMO any and all settings you could create for shuffles is valid, as long as it creates solvable seeds
so "worst case" its RSL (random settings league) type stuff
im not invested enough to watch it again, but it would be cool to see keiper bring awareness to it. I doubt most of his community knows about it
well - you got the seed
that ball's in your park then tippiGiggle
no I dont have the seed, the genned it locally on their end, even had so experimental cosmetics
well... - still could ask for them to make ya a bps patch or send the lanky
my redeem was basically "i dont know what im doing, you pick the settings, i just wanna see a kremlinng kapture" LUL
you can just clip thru them?
he did a trick a bit ago with rusl to talk to him without his cutscene triggering
rusl and gorcoron share the same index or whatever for text, so doing that sets his text to let you into the mines
the wall is gone, but the gorons have not moved, so he just has to run behind them
having master sword early kind of screws up getting into goron mines
that trick save like 2 minutes?
alternatively you can also get in with spinner. it's kind of funny
there's an invisible wall there normally if you aren't able to clear the text but spinner is for some reason able to go through it
did an glitchless no S+Q speedrun and got a 6:29, it was a bad run but definitely improveable
OMG that is fantastic. The TP bugVirus hit ryan as well.
link where are you finding this oxygen
if your air meter is in the red when you do the last regrab it's over
it also depends on where she's going
dont let the bomb kill you
bro couldn't hold his breath for 2 more seconds
saw Hugo being rude earlier, annoying but I’m sure PB tomorrow Prayge
they can type pape or TP in chat to vote :P
or get on twitch in the next min or so
Mai, the only DMescque deck I'm running is Shining Sarcophagus
The other two decks is Sky Striker and Maliss
Which is more VRAINS era decks
I was just going to ask how much the plando redeem will be and lo and behold, I look and it already there KEKW
curious because you use a GC with raphnet, what do you use for input display and do you notice any issues?
oh wait I just saw in the panel what kind
Although the link 404’s now Sadge
yo I popped back in at the right time
been working on the plando and come back to a rando
I’m cold today. I was even cold at work.
nice, ty! been wanting to look into something for n64 input display
I need some warmth. I’m going to hide under my blankets lol
i freeze my ass off in my room way to cold over here
oh man just needing a new cable for a different console is nice then, you’re getting 2 in 1 for the package then
yeah my plando have only up to master 2 cuz fuck 3
Well what do we have here paperLuigi at last
im getting better, yesterday I finished a banjo seed without map tracker
I saw TP on youtube but clicked to find paper mario phanto274Thonk
You know it's gonna be a good seed when 5 minutes in you need to climb the mountain bootless
I never bother with this teleport
and just star oob the whole time
This is the first time i've noticed the flowey raid alert
because you can stay oob when you go over from the train tracks and than not need to do this
i collected all 8 pieces of bullshit
which is also the much easier way to do it without hammer
What is that then? It sounds exactly like flowey
we get to see rugged now
because getting your spin to cancel without hammer is just stupid
yeah that sounds like flowey's laugh from the beginning of undertale
oh rking boo? I thought it was fawful from the mario and luigi games lmao
doesn’t it match the raid alert icon? Hmm
@PeachedPocky It sounds nothing like fawful?
Goombario annoyingly open up dojo if you think about it
does goombario affect logic for dojo or is it just based on chapters cleared?
And just like that boots are gonna remain hidden for 2 hours
Why have so many zelda players been doing paper mario rando recently, and why only the 64 version from what ive seen?
Think they'll do the other Papers soon?
TTYD does have a rando but it sucks
I love seeing tricks in a game I have no fucking clue about
I'm asking you Kaiba, you and your new Blue Eyes support
God that yugioh alert may be my favourite thing on Twitch
plano is 100K ... Phantom why phanto274S
it pulls so many at good times
100K should make you play DK64R LUL
@Axl_SR i been cooking a plando for them
I need to resume cooking now that it's live on non-dev
so i went and looked it up bcuz i was curious
did yoy know that both flowey's laugh and king boos laugh were made by the same guy
from warner borthers, of all people
Gear Shuffle with Traps I see
I've played through both LM and undertale but I will probably always think of flowey when hearing that laugh
honestly I dont know anyone that doesnt run gear shuffle
@Axl_SR I've done a couple seeds with gearless start but since I play glitchless my boots are either always in a shop or in prologue
How many spheres were those, since we needed laki for goombario for parakarry, which led us here
Oh, I see start at Lvl 10 as well
Could you theoretically do volcano without boots or do you need them to skip the ultra block?
If for some ungodly reason you have ultra hammer before any boots it'd be beatable
So I've only just this weekend been exposed to the TTYD Tower of Trials
and in 3 simple steps, you ride the fish
@CaptainMD13 Tower of trials I found fun for 2-3 runs and then it becomes repetitive, watching bringle play it is good but actually playing it is boring
Well then you do like 2/3 of it in Danger Mario and win like a champ. Still can't believe you pulled that off
when people say TTYD randomizer do they mean the shufflizer?
@Axl_SR The only TTYD rando I've found only shuffles badges and items, to my knowledge the version bringle played isn't publicly available
that sounds like how the old pokemon randos work, doesnt really change up much
your still playing the same vanilla game
like how a battle network rando works too
A dream for me would be a TTYD HD rando, since it could have all the QOL changes of the remake with the changes of rando like fast text speed
that would require for people to use a delisted emulator, thats not gonna happen
I’ve only played it once but what would you say the biggest issue with the M&L one is?
@Axl_SR I can dream, even if realistically it will either never happen or it happens like 10 years from now when switch support dies
Oh man pro life start seems rough
also what does the switch version that the GCN version doesnt?
That is fair, I was surprised about that when I played
Seems like it would be better if it started in Castle town too
After playing PM64 rando it makes it hard for me to go back to regular paper mario since there's so many nice changes with the rando, especially cutscene and prologue skip
the peeps behind AP are not necessarily the most deep diving folks I think
most of the more indepth randos come from dedicated ppl / communities before AP picks them up
@Axl_SR Better fast travel pipes, partner wheel, better graphics(kinda), and fun things like some chapters having small things to make them faster like the creepy steeple pipe in chapter 4 or that spring in chapter 5
@yourfluffypalsam Not to mention Nerfed Hammer Throw, 1-frame 4th bounce, the list goes on
Can a single-player AP seed run on console?
all TTYDR needs rly imo is "get rid of the slow start with the tutorials
@CaptainMD13 Hammer throw was always garbage, but yeah the power bounce nerf sucks
like... to my knowledge not a single thing you get til the star map is got is lost in time for flag reasons
since you quite literally ONLY have map freestanding items
and if the concern is whether ppl search for the map? no
thats a starting item and thats it
emerald can run on console, banjo can run on N64 with the everdrive connector, but most dont @MarioManTAW
what even is the argument about prologue TTYD 🤣
not a SINGLE THING of that state is not gettable later
Phantom, you run LTTP on everdrive right?
boohoo, put the item in the bin
The real question is what takes longer, PM64 prologue or TTYD prologue? going off just getting to chapter 1
though isnt ttyd as much flag hell as pape64 is?
sooo just make it be in the bin then, given tattles exist in there already
That’s shorter than Pape 64 Clueless
just make it be a spawned item in there somewhere or a "press a to get" if frankly is too troublesome
and outside that, nothing else rly is prologue only
bigger problem is fixing the railroad chapters - so 4, 6 rly
chapter 3 ya could just set rank 5 on base imo
I was literally thinking the exact same thing
its its AP you can remove those from the pool
Why would you want to play the rando if it’s gated behind there too potentially
Just set it to the point after the Bowser fight
@Axl_SR not if you need the star
chapter reward still needs you to get to rank 1 past rawk
so item junking wouldnt solve that
best rly is if you can auto rank up to the actual mission bits then
Skip all the fights without logical item requirements, easy
Because for PM64 there's not only the whole peachs castle section but there's also 4 mandatory fights , and going through all of the prologue area, toad town, and star haven before finally getting to chapter 1
just force the easy fights enemy wise, but progress ranks accellerated to the actual bits of not fighting
I'M ASKING YOU KAIBA, YOU AND YOUR NEW BLUE EYES SUPPORT TAKING FOREVER FOR YOUR TURN
@Jonxhas I wonder if you could theoretically just cut all the fights besides the clefts and rawk hawk, then once you beat rawk hawk just have the door always be open to fight grubba instead of being forced to immediately fight him
oh I thought ch 3 was with doopliss
That's chapter 4, which could be SUPER shortened by just having the first doopliss fight be the only fight but only be able to fight him with the letter
TTYD rando desperately needs a project plan before starting
Like he just won't show up or the door leading to him doesn't open until you have the letter
Random P laying around the world somewhere
I feel at most ch 3 should only have 3 fights
oh riiight, Superstar saga is a bit stupid there
cus you need certain Beanbean castle states right?
Just cut all story elements and make some chapters take like 10 minutes KEKW
plus people would just blindly play TTYD AP "cause its the greatest mario RPG ever"
I'm not looking forward to having to buy 3 copies of the new DMG for my shining sarcophagus deck
All those Star Pieces for a cocnut
how many checks does the train have?
Still waiting for how they will censor the new DMG
@Axl_SR Easy fix: Just skip straight to riverside, then skip to smorg
@Axl_SR The Pot, the 3 missing Sticky Bomb items, 2 Memos
Since I'm actually playing the deck
there's a panel in the front of the train then one in the ghost room
I'm playing Shining Sarcophagus, Sky Striker and Maliss and I still need to finish construction on the three decks
yeah I knew about the one in the front of the train
Thankfully most of the expensive cards I got out of the way
riverside is the best part of chapter 6 in my opinion since it's the only part where you aren't spamming A and moving around for 15+ minutes
have you heard any updates on eldexterr, like what he is working on now?
I play Salamangreats. But I did enjoy the Earthbound Servant and Trickstar decks from the events
I also play a Zexal deck when I want to feel spicy
I will try to if I remember after I do the dishes
Lets think, about 2-3 minutes for PH, about 6-7 for riverside, give or take 4-5 minutes for smorg, so about 15-16 minutes of just mashing A
Question. If you use dark mode with bluesky does that make it blacksky?
I'm gonna play animal crossing on my other monitor while listening to this
@zeliversal Did you hear the set after Duelist Alliance is for Utopia
I have not. But I also don't worry about sets because I only play MD
I have been considering an @ Ignisiter deck for laughs tho
holy moly that is a long time
Duelist Advance has new Utopic Zexal support
Maliss and @Ignister have good synergy so I'm waiting for Duelist Alliance
Is there a way to skip needing her to reach general guy?
Is chapter 8 entrance shuffled with these settings?
How many castles do you own?
What's more annoying, the angle or the constant AAAAAAAA coming from the shy guys?
my long term goal is to try All Bosses so I would not be mad
also the ruins stone skip one too is nice
between that and PM archives I’m sure that will be lots
oh lmao well I’ll have to check when the time comes
generally, general guy is quite general. he lived and then he died, *checks word count* damn i need 10 pages
desert is so awful to clear bc of the invisible blocks
I feel like the enemy levelling was a little too steep when i played but it did force me to play smarter
yoo its paper luigi my favorite game
I find it easier to get high tidal wave damage by using a GC controller on wii VC
just watched your ruins stone skip video
dude just 48k more til VIP lol
I’d love to see more about the all bosses routing
Better than fighting a shy guy for one
No need to glitch into chapter 2 boss fight arena
one mpre shot to block it!
Is it just when the stars stop? I always forget the timing
Time to full clear this place out
it was the MJ of swoops
I think I finally trained myself not to lol
that and the bucket one putting that on the way back
Koopa Bros might be the only easy one
i need a bowsers big bean burrito to satiate my hunger
its from dunkey's mario maker video where he held the world record on a level named bowsers big bean burrito
For me I want meatloaf for some reason
especially if you like glaze the outside in brown sugar
i mean. you can exclude ketchup but yeah
maybe you could turn it into a sandwich
put breads on the sides as the side
i want the baby back ribs i had in Page
I wonder if anyone makes like a meatloaf tin thats like sausage sized, so I could cut meatloaf to use on crackers
true but I can't eat sausage
Maybe a sweet chili glaze but ketchup glaze is all right
god i loved the pf changs spicy glaze
tubbas been eating cheeto puffs again
I hope somebody makes a mod that replaces tubba with kool aid man
he would burst through the wall right there
get him a club he’s so small
this is the area that punked me
oh my god its a flying cheep cheep
well now I know one check ive been missing
Funny the Laki power up before the laki dungeon
the best i can do is a life shroom
so you did skip Koopa Bros lol
oh wait right it could be tutankoopa
We're looking for WD40 for Russ T
Don't enjoy this theme for long
Tell me you do hurricane route without telling me you do hurricane route
I was a lil late daurn't mind me
Ohh Phantom I had a smashed whiskey earlier for din din
FROZEN WHISKEY SMASH Maker’s Mark, Mathilde Pêche liqueur, lemon juice, mint syrup
omg I meant with dinner LUL
I had a 12 oz ribeye steak medium smothered in grilled onions and mushrooms with buttered mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots
I mean first time you're in Houston
That meal is just too rich for my blood
I go to this place once a year LUL
My meals are like here take these lap cheung sausages and rice and that's it with an egg
With how pricey eggs have gotten adding just an egg seems like a luxury item now
the one time I count myself lucky I can't eat eggs
Lap cheung fried rice with eggs is a decent cheap fried rice
Probably with a sweeter soy sauce
I used to make Spam and eggs ALL the time but of course I was migraine boy all the time
I'd just only go with green beans for fried rice
The rest of the veggies seems out of balance with fried rice
Not to mention how wet the frozen veggies are which could ruin the fried rice
I think I was calculating that eggs were like 40% cheaper here even taking the dollar into account and I was shook
I saw how much they were selling them in places like Mexico and it was like a few dollars a dozen
I meant to check local markets egg pricing
Eggs are 7 something a dozen where I live and 12 dollars after the first 2
I don't need them that bad
I had to look and eggs are like 5-7 $CAD and a local grocery store for a dozen
yup like 3.50-5 I think around there USD
I miss when an 18 count was 2.50
love to star storm on final
why you do me like that
ok cool the plando page auto save
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
my lawyer has advised I'm not allowed to say "OR ELSE" anymore
awsm sub 330. Hope u have a great rest of day or night.
Listen, my bathroom sink is due for a drain clean too and that shit sucks
Long hair sucks for that, didn't realize how bad it could get until I moved in with my wife
Lets gooo and good luck buddy
Yeah I have that problem too
My beard is that long i know what problem it is 😅🤣
How's one of my favorite streamers doing?
Which glitch is the hardest to do? The only one I can think of is lakebed boss
Well no I don't mean morpheel itself
I meant the boss key skip

The little tip tail shake while walking
Can I send you a tutorial on Iza bomb duping? PauseChamp
I’ve never made a tutorial so I lowkey want to try KEKW
@Midnaliin tutorials are fun to make until you release them
and then people either dont even listen to them at all and then say it was bad or they ask you 50 questions that was in the video
On a scale of Sunny to Night, what is your princess?
can't wait to see it in a couple minutes EZ
I got word today that my AGDQ '25 Coin is on its way.
I didn't think it would be the goats NOOO
It's 40something outside and my windows are open, it ain't cold enough in here
Once you discover the joy of having house be 45 degrees and you're covered by every blanket you own, you'll understand.
@DreamcatcherSky instructions unclear; i rotated my house and the blankets aren't helping with the now rotated floor
yea I just mean the JA was a little early I think
why do i always tune into bugs
i mean yeah it is like 19 minutes into the run and relies on a finicky ai-controlled entity moving near a wall that can and will troll you
it's so unlikely but yeah i've seen some horrible ones
always a 50% chance for her to stop after the first 3 stops
so in theory she can go on forever...
I wonder if anyone has timed it
maybe you could ask the tp discord
Phantom I regret to inform you that meal I had last night wreckt my stomach Deadge
yeah I was so sad and in pain LUL
im currently simulating 10,000 gohma fights to see how many holes minimum and maximum we get
I remade gohmas movement and light behavior
wanted it to be as accurate as possible lol
was more just fucking around and having fun
cuz flipping a coin isn't fun
the bad movements are baked in cuz it actually is moving around like gohma and picking holes like gohma
so far I've found if gohma picks holes horizontally and vertically it results in more holes
than if it chooses diagonal twice
you can get 3 holes only with 2 diagonals
you can get up to 6 before the 200-300 timer ends
and I think thats where allot of the bad rng comes to play
the interesting thing to me is technically it means you aren't losing any time
if you get 6 fast holes
cuz the timer was in place anyway
on average gohma should travel 3 holes before 200 frames
cuz it typically will pick a bad light and do a 360
im just watching like 100 gohmas run around
you have to wait for 4?
also what do you think about the bomb strat
I found you can use a bomb to speed him up with ordon sword
like you walk over with a bomb pulled and drop it behind him
i started doing it for rando
GL with your consistency, I lost all of mine on wall jumps in Zero Mission
Had been up to today where I'm too frustrated and angry at being unable to wall jump for freaking acid worm
Like, from decent consistent to completely unable, 0% consistency
And having to do a roundabout strat that easily loses 10 seconds minimum and makes it WAY harder.
Yeah I've been struggling with wall jumps from left walls for like half the month, I just can't nail them
Again, was actually doing them just fine last month.
a former coworker just told me they might've referred to me as "work husband" on occasion
I assume it has to do with game state stuff.
and i i missed th whole explanation because of adds
and presumably you have to dodge the cutscene trigger to get that text
closing in on sub 4 sum of best.
I can't believe midnas fucking dead
But also she's sick in the rad way
is this the best ladder in any zelda game ever?
This isn't as bad as climbing to the top after uhhh
But that also is not a ladder
He's so camp I love it for him
if you go fast then you are going fast!
is the only diffrence between this and vanilla intended dungeon order just that you do snowpeak early
yo! soy dora! can you find the jolteon? glennj5WAVE
It's very considerate that the main chamber one just watches you do shit
Will you try some BC runs at some point?
But what about before the year 0?
Temple of Time do be a thing
Time for big ol fucking 😳
this game of breakout is crazy
I love when I make a code change that should have no impact but somehow it does
And I don't know why, but the end result is more desirable so
So I think legally I'm obligated to shut up and take it
It will if you say it will
Me. I'm where it falls apart
But it's THE Greg of all time
i spent the next several hours hunting for kinstone fusions and getting a bunch of rewards
i got big bomb bag, bigger quiver, got the two godesses moved into houses, got the flippers, and placed myself at the begining of the next dungeon  before calling it
and made it for best dungeon
just a cool 18 min timesave 🕶️
when the cheating is good and fair
It was good but I failed the thing I was going to make a tutorial for
what are you making a tutorial for mid
ah i can help with that
I've only been getting like 30 secs at a time sometimes for channels that run 3 mins
Yeah, I've heard that ad inventory gets kinda slim this time of the year
you're only like 26 min behind a 3:39 rn
you're 18 min behind a 3:39
yo Z you're like 18 min behind your bed time go the fuck to sleep
No its an all nighter tonight, I woke up 6pm and have a 9am lecture
Im improving that's the first time ive gone nocturnal in like 2 or 3 weeks
2 isn't too many, you'll be fine FeelsOkayMan
Its like maths 1 but even more shit
I love zant he's such a useless little twink
that is generally what enemies try to do Phantom
Cats do seem to exclusively tread on your balls for no reason
If you pb I will drink cat shit
I'll drink my orange soda ty
if your cat's shit is drinkable it may need to go to the vet
And it is indeed cat shit
Splash is abt to have a 4loko
Personally here in Mexico it's the cheapest to get wasted sooo
I stopped watching for a bit to continue my casual playthrough of this and just did the first half of this dungeon and in that time you did all of ToT CitS and most of this
It's different casually from a speedrun scenario
why are you good at video games phantom its cheating to be good at video games
me when I see good Celeste players
zant untwinked himself for a second
just cause you get to be a giant does not untwinkify you
that probs doesnt hold up in court
I should ask my Attorney Online group
Anyways off to the next one
flaring is judging me rn i dont like it
cyndaquil is going through a trip rn
Meh enough leniency to a 9 cycle zelda
Unless you find another way to fuck up a run
I mean the body could be made out of enchanted piss.....
link that lip gloss looks fire
Why would you keep playing at that point brother
Might as well go to bed
Nothing better than the squidna scene
the speedrun gods: aw hell yes time for hubris
you missed something yellow back there
i say put 1000000000 dollars on it rn
I got one cornchip on plus 4
thats what link's crossbow training was for
then where would the creators of the game get their just due then?
will you guinea pig my route NiceSoftlock
it's done but i think i'm missing a letter somewhere for a star piece lol
yo amish ty for the gl
yo Lopez ty for the gl
can I redeem a long run towards Lopez's redeem to make it on the list
im gonna redeem pokepark true hundo
with the power of editing it is
when would you want to test it lol i can have it done by thursday earliest
You gonna go for sub 4?
Don't stress about ib times too much
Credits are so good in this game
I love games like these with afterscene credits of the unfolding peace
Funny thing is right now I'm recording my wants list for Yu-Gi-Oh cards I want to buy in which rarities and sets
Just need to record which rarity Sky Striker stuff I want
I know I want an alt art Engage
just voting for the magic thing cuz i have no idea what it is
is it  magic pengel the quest for color?
ahh i see since its losing gonna check it out
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
iwa mt rugged... well iwa does mean stone
and mt rugged is the most rocky area LUL
do you have any ray tracks?
is this just gonna be a coding stream?
I would expect this kind of stream on the alt
did you see icebound's follow up message
Phantom do you have an alt that I'm not following
@Axl_SR less than half that cause like the first 10 min was waiting room.
if they do one would they do the other?
would recommend clarifying on the glitch list page
Forgot what stream I was in for a sec
i was supposed to be doing stuff like 3 hours ago but i got voluntold into going up towen to help my grandma w her smart tv
what kinda tracker stuff do you have in mind?
ngl for a second i thought i had a window in front of the stream lol
I'd have to see which room it is does it have any interesting aspects to the room
Yooo you are also doing of the coding PogBones
quake hammer room maybe then idfk
Ok Phantom, I have a small problem and I think we should go in on this together
Did you see the Framework desktop yesterday?
Do you know framework at all or no?
Framework is a company that started with laptop manufacturing. Their laptops are designed to be completely modular and upgradable. Every year you could just buy a new motherboard, swap them out with just a screwdriver, and reuse the same display, etc. Or if your display breaks or you want a higher res, but a new one and replace, etc.
so basically a desktop but in a laptop shell that's neat
They just announced a new 'desktop' which is actually the new AMD AI laptop chips, but with standard desktop power/IO headers. So basically a Mac studio but AMD and more replaceable and better, and significantly less expensive
And I want one... 5GHz cores with DDR5 with insane memory bandwidth for just 120W/140 boost? Uhm yes please
The top spec is 128GB, 16-cores, with the integrated radeon (but it has full access to the DDR5 for LLMs or otherwise, and seems to match a 4060 in gaming), with the case and power supply, for $2000
Also standard M2 drives for storage
You can buy the motherboard (so the CPU, GPU, and RAM) separate and bring your own PSU too
Anyway. If you could just split one with me, that'd be great YEP Mondo's refusing to give me an advance on my salary
no tas level tricks that need to make it in?
I wonder how many new tricks you can do with full entrance rando, like theoretically you could sushie glitch everywhere with it right?
what do you need to change?
whats going on how are you doing
i bought two of those JP white controllers for less than 120usd
The island where the Huskies are extra loud and the Shibas scream
Can I just acknowledge this is a bop
Are you implementing all glitch logic in your tracker now?
ooh emo update for s4? :D
Ultra Boots don't get you GR right?
It probably hasn't been reported bc it's hard to get there w/o hammer
hit the sub 2 on racetime
god I love tryna figure out discrepancies with data I didn't create. I have 2 different sources and they aren't lining up when it should be the exact same data and I have to figure out which is accurate lol.
whenever i look at code like this i realize i am truly a filthy ruby dev
having an intense reaction to 4 space tabs
my eyes don't bleed which is a lot better than C languages or Java or Python
daughter of the dark god jump scare
Holy balls it’s a Phantom stream LETSGO
Just do this next time you need to enter that room :)
I am still deconstructing my previous b3313 notes atm
down to like 150 lines not fully brought in right
slowly getting there though which is neat
Reference video had input display, didn't it?
This soundtrack is a banger pepeJAM
Unrelated, but did you ever learn the Snowman Skip with Laki?
I mean it is this room what do you expect
what tricks have you been messing around with?
why can't it be accounted for?
ER wouldn't mess that up more than any other LZS trick, right?
I was curious how far you can make it in the ruins jump less as it should now be possible to make it there without them
oh god yeah entrance rando with LZS would be stupid
Hypothetically, ER+LZS is pretty incompatible yeah
cause yeah you could get so many different angles
yeah that's what I thought just wasn't sure if there was even more clippy shenanigans you could do
if sushie glitch ER is disabled then yeah LZS ER would prolly be like 100x harder to implement.
Imagine using Clippy for a Laki-less trick
I mean can't you make it jumpless if you can raise the sand or am I wrong about that
it should be possible to full clear mt rugged thoug
You need Super Boots for LTR, does RTL even require Boots?
Naming is still definitely one of the 4 horsemen of programming. Wonderful seeing people doing the hard work for us rando enjoyers!
Looks like base logic for RTL is Super Boots or Laki
would right to left be out of logic if entrance rando was on if you just disabled all LZS
even though it doesn't need LZS
I believe the return logic should only ever matter with ER anyway so idk
sushie glitch is also something that entrance rando would change a lot
yeah I think unlike LZS it would be possible to write logic for it but also it would be a complete pain and take up a lot of time so prob not worth
Write logic for Anti Guy skip and also for just fighting Anti Guy YEP
I think I have used a lemon candy a total of once and that is simply because one natually spawned for me and so I was like why not
Yes made it in time from my biking. So what u cracking?
would this also let you go from the left entrance to the right one jumpless if you had entrance rando on?
think there was a 2nd jumpless laki strat in prologue that was posted at the same time as that one
Okay well it took me a while but I finally figured out why the data discrepancy exists, now I just gotta figure out what I'm going to do about it lol.
So will the logic only be from the left?
lets you get the coins as well as the fire flower
Did confirm the TP works from the left, does the new logic also allow skipping the block coming from the left?
yeah the rest besides the jank first attack stuff but those require being high enough level
has jumpless attack fx C been added
was just browsing the strat channel
time for me to find 10 more jumpless strats in the next hour Kappa
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Damn...gotta be quicker than that lol
@AnniLyn2 sorry was busy slaying a monster lol
Omg I thought your hair got longer...didn't think it was a cloth lolz
Anyone know how to properly fold a fitted sheet?
Is audible on stream, similar to your volume
No chat on stream is intended or?
why is the category called 101%?
2 chill voices and pape music. Lovely
does that mean tts will be more enjoyable for you
I'd have to wait though I need like an hour or 2 into the vod when people are asleep kazamsCatglubhappy
I see the badge on people
its all can see the badges
I just see the diff badge
i can time out Raven KEKW
@blacktiger51 did you actually do it?? Lul
@RavenFP cuz you send that from lopez chat so the button is there KEKW
Temporary caffeine if you choose the right one
Are you guys racing each other?
Me very carefully watching this run so I know which are the fastest Star Pieces to collect for my challenge runs: NOTED HmmNotes
You know...why not lolz imma watch both just because lolz
while the dog is my fave character in mansion it seems u need to do updates.
Soda isn't helping! You two are too chill evo17Flip
Nah I'm just sassing. Maybe I should finally test coffee
What the hell is that emote, keklmao, dog dog ffzX dog
evo17Hiyo evo17Heart evo17KO evo17Banzai evo17Flip evo17Wut my favorite ones lolz
ok i guess you don't have a command for that
so how do you know what the questions are?
I'm not even gonna fix that..
Since López isn't watching, united sucks ass
Barcelona is the real deal with Madrid next anywho
Those fucking professional divers who are divas?
I expected you to have some taste stavros
nah my real team is La Galaxy and Olympiakos and Paok.
Don't tell me you root for galaxy just because giroud is there
ive been a galaxy fan since 2 yrs before we got Beckham. James Donovan is like my fave player ever next to the greek greats which i refuse to spell names
@jokehow I don't get the joke
bro is not doing mailman skip
I’m here. doesn’t look like I’m too late
how many times do you hit him
bro is just building up his counter
1 hr party of race and no winners
have you ever forgotten something deep into a run before
Lmao at Phantom's announcement resulting in a big ass emote on Blopez' channel france16Kekw ads
that doesn't kill you right if you're at 1hp
Man it'd probably kill you if it did
i always forget this is a real category now and not just a joke, gl
double it and pass it to the next person
Lopez you apparently you have an echo
On Phans stream...my iPad died but lemme see
I wouldn't want you to mess up your race just because of an echo on one side but not yours. Rain seems to have sensitive ears
there's only 5 ultrashrooms in JP so you have to make sure on JP to use some of them for recipe combinations
Gold oinks don't drop ultrashroom on JP
time to chain quizmo in koopa village west
im titled so im here to chill
100% requires all 50 recipes, 160 Star Pieces, 64 Quizmo quizzes, 80 badges, 16 Super Blocks, 7 Star Spirit Cards, All 4 permanent Key Items, All 4 boot and hammer upgrades. The extra 1% comes from defeating all bosses and minibosses.
hard to remember which recipe combination you made in this game since there's no recipe screen from the menu
keep the golds and inflate your sob
2 hrs of solidness and no winner yet. Busy cooking dinner
my pb is on the first route made still OMEGALUL
i dont remember the logistics of this run, how are we on quizmo rng
all you can really hope for in a race i guess lol
how does bro know what the answer is
is it just ch4 that has spooks in this run, i forget
Money can't solve all your problems, but this one it can
I see you have a ton of games under your belt, which would you say are a favorite or 2?
Good luck to only phantom phanto274Mash
Any tips for someone who can't guard Bowser's star rod attack? I honestly would run this game so often if I could just consistently get it
Oh dip it's Morpheus too! poggers
yo fancyfish! i remember your name, you tried doing any% for this game awhile ago right? hope all is good
Felt. the zoom out is so hard to understand lol. If only you didn't have to start at the beginning every time. Hardware issue I suppose lol
@morpheus080 Yessir! Still never beat a run because of Bowser, but I remember you complimenting my Flower Fields skip for being a noob lol
All is good man. I hope all is the same with you! Planning on getting back into speedrunning so I'm glad to see Phantom on playing this banger
Also, I play with N64 attached to my monitor through all the fun cords. Idk if that is problematic, but I only really have issues with Bow Wow Wave
Then it's just practice... Sadge lol
I'd rather practice BHS than that fight lol
What's the big difference in this route that allows such time save?
We love a good Recipe reroute
alu is also streaming art as well
I gotta make sure to keep doing that donation thing to get my VIP points lol
@Shadowcire Be patient about it ur an awsm chatter.
@Shadowcire and an awesome person shiiiSmile
What's your favorite and least favorite chapter for 100%? Something tells me Flower Fields is rough lol
i thought you were doing tp glundo ngl
jess you should have joined this race
4 hrs of greatness and no winner yet
Paper Mario is the best vibe idc what anyone says
i'm assuming hundo doesn't require max level
is there partner upgrades in this game? I forget
well that's good! glad you guys aren't regretting this choice yet haha
gl monadoBless I hope it continues to go well
I don't even wanna know how you begin to re-route for a category like this
bro is making popcorn right next to the mic
all my homies hate that clubba
Race may have just been decided
I was just about to ask LUL
you feel like grinding this cat? haha
looks like the King blessed the race 1st try!
so you're running it back after this right Chatting
how do you remember which option to choose
dude I can't tell if you're baiting lmao
yall should do a rando 100% race :P
is max level part of 100%ing? lol
you must like talking to this guy
can you activate the sfx badges pls
I'm getting ads in Spanish, does twitch know about me monkaS
I wish tp had this game's text
then in ttyd they made you mash again
I wish I could enjoy some spm content. Its so lame how Zach link and castle are such selective gamers they cringe kill tricks and fights. But oh well.
no not drama just when i show up even lurking they end stream or never finish runs,
that still put him to sleep lmfao
Hii Phantom, how are you doing today? phanto274Wave str9ngLove
are we in the home stretch
i'm guessing there's 2 badges here
i think you have two audio sources for your friend
active. but i understand ur in the middle of a run lol
ive never seen that i dont think lol
did that always do 12 in the older routes lmfao
it did in fact do 11
it's been almost 4yrs since i ran this
Oh man the Sushie tech so they don't throw bones, that's Pog
Here we go! It comes down to this all!
gotta wait for peach to put her hands up
oh yeah this not rando KEKW
when I did all cards in 2015 I remember fucking hating bowser

Brian I didn't want you Sadge
already beat the new monster hunter game
i get 120hz and 60 fps on ps5
my friends crash alot on pc
my friend get 40fps on a 2070 super
damn yeah i hate anything on pc
the ps5 version have 0 issues
i'm glad to be here at the beginning i always miss the very start
just tell steam its broken and doesn't work anymore
i got a refund for a game i played for like 10 hours
well there is a quest board but that end game KEKW
Hey I just finished a MSR lolz
How long do you think this'll take?
No reset after Hugo until you lose to Jamal lol
Are you holding the reset combo during the load zone?
Ohh the controller doesn’t work I see
Sorry I wasn’t fully paying attention KEKW
Might as well prepare first yeah?
Claw on Y good job NODDERS
I usually put claw on X and arrows on Y
Wish I could throw out quick spins like that
Yeah I’ve never seen that before
I can convert to t1 when I get into a job
Idk if it’s helpful but instead of back flipping I target walk and I find it pretty consistent
That may be a good alternative if the camera fucks up
Because it’s not a run ofc lol
Yoy! Again to everyone here and I just got up from a short nap to refresh myself
That is so real when I lived with 5 roommates I always had to clean a mountain of dishes just to make a meal
then the same person who left it would start to like invade the kitchen as I was cooking. so I always just ended up eating fast food lol
Did you talk to them about it? I wonder if changes could be made or are they just not listening
nah i just got one person to blame if my place gets dirty at all LUL
yeah small sink and no dishwasher for me. if i get lazy for one day it's game over
Yeah you just can’t be lazy with roommates though that’s just inconsiderate. although sometimes I feel like some roommates expect things to be clean a certain way and that’s annoying on the other end of the spectrum KEKW
Okay so we know the culprit is the basement dweller smh
Okay for me that shit gets so messy LMAO like I’m dropping sauce and noodles. but I will wipe it down (especially if you have roommates like you just can’t)
I just came back I HATE that
Well okay no I can't clean anything that would have grease like immediately because hot stove
Gas is still pretty hot though I thought
Oh I thought you guys meant the one with eyes
Ohh yeah true but if it’s right beside the burner it’s a little sus
We use to clean off the eyes and replace the foil...people think it's dangerous though
"You really shouldn't take that out. What if you don't put it back right and break it??"
LetThemCook is an emote i feel like should be around, i did find one on 7tv lol
I feel like I know what you're talking about but I might be wrong
I do that to dishes to check if they're clean
Isn't marble like...black and grayish too?
i wish i had nicer looking counters but they are at least super easy to keep clean
i hate everything in my apartment but i do like the $400 rent so phanto274Shrug
Yeah you just get jumpscared by all the gross messes left on it
Sorry I pinged you what I think you mean...I originally thought that was marble lolz
i have a like, 700sq ft garage apartment that is so meh, but not having to live in a complex is pretty nice
yeah, my coworkers mom was looking for someone to rent it and i was like HeyGuys
like anytime i have complaints it's so hard to not be like "well it's only $400"
Especially when you accidentally touch the worst part
like it's not rundown and it's remodeled so i shouldn't complain
Today honestly feels so restless. I can’t decide if I want to run any%, AD, nap or be productive KEKW
All of the above- at the same time
man this fight looks like trash lol
Just skip it next time Clueless
Would you say Stahlord is the worst boss of TP
confirmed learning this skip when i learn this game Kappa
Yeah being made to fight on the spinner for phase one with the RNG spawns make it bad
it's a cool fight in theory but i always hated that phase 1 even casually
Kind of a shame too, since I really like stalord in casual fights
There should be a joke TP romhack where every boss is replaced by Stahlord
When you look at it...all shard bosses suck in their own way
that fight seems really satisfying to do well
When stahlord is a worse boss than the phases of Ganondork
You take that back gamer lolz
Okay I ordered pizza life is very good NODDERS
I still find that really cool
Rain made a lot of gumbo and I ate too much
Why are you trying to turn link into minced meat monkaS
#FanningRoom I do believe the dev miscalculated the extension
Didn't have to throw your broken armor at link
Gotta admit...argorok has some pretty impressive scales
You got it this go around
Bobby is on the way with my pizza pie LETSGO
Yeah that’s what I ordered dominos is so good KEKW
gl on all major skips o/
do you know if there's a way to change the font on the 100% tracker
i tested one of my new controllers i ordered, what would have been ess on my main controller rn was 35 on the new one lol
i knew my controller was weird for ess but man OMEGALUL
my main controller has a smash 4 white board
that might be a shell issue
oh yeah i press in the middle
i use my black smash controller for just fighting odolwa cuz quick spinning feels better on that controller
otherwise it feels pretty bad for MM
it def has less use than my MM controller, even with all of the ult in played in 2019
i've only used oem for all of these games so i usually at least try them to see what happens
my s4 controller is funny in that 90% of the time, it holds down the X button upon plugging it in, even after cleaning it lol
is it me or m drunken eyes but i morph pink again?
nah im still purple stavros FeelsOkayMan
Im finally free of Kyurem and Unova hell
aside from wanting a back up, i'd prefer to keep my MM controller for just MM so that's mainly why im hoarding jp whites now baseg
id like to get tongued by it KEKW OMEGALUL
I remember a long time ago I had a very weird smash 4 controller
in some games it worked prefectly fine
but in others holding L + R together just disabled all analog inputs so I couldn't use the stick or c-stick
in prime 1 it worked fine
we'll figure out how to defeat fyrus next time Sadge
i died to fyrus lmaooooo and then had one of the worst skull kids in a different run
you gotta for further left with the roll
but i had a good time, got some golds
I don't really struggle with the bomb boost much
sometimes I think the boomerang hits the bomb so I just lose time to having to wait longer for it to blow up
oh yea this room sucks in ad right
On a scale of peasant to queen, what is your twilight?
@Zeliversal i need lots of em
Nope. Literally no one needs mirror
Tell your computer that's a skill issue
only if you had the ps5 version Sadge
Just get a small rig just for streaming since everything would be through the capture card anyway
And then if you leave the computers alone long enough, you might find a raspberry pi one morning
EPona truly is the worst boss
what does JotWaS even stand for
180s like that should be illegal
do you know how to access the twitch highlighter even if you're over the storage limit?
I remember seeing a post about it but idr what the link is
guess i'll start on that then lmao
youtube won't allow me to upload my glundo run so i want to highlight it lmfao
filesize is just too big OMEGALUL
i can't record glundo in 4k with the settings i use so i'll just go back to 1080p
i didnt either but it's 256 gb or 12 hours, whatever comes first
The maximum file size you can upload is 256 GB or 12 hours, whichever is less. We've changed the limits on uploads in the past, so you may see older videos that are longer than 12 hours.
no date or anything, and no sign of verification meaning anything besides the basic verification letting you upload over 15 mins
new controller sound like hype to me
I'll see if I can get verified on yt and see if it will let me upload after lol
PHANTOM HOW DO YOU BE ENTERTAINING TO PEOPLE idk good luck btw
You were just doing a wii u version cosplay
we can play ww rando on it :)
just dunno about the hdmi port
sooo this route doesnt get sling? p4ntzThink
how is the new controller treating you
so its kind of like driving a new car
Why not do all of them?
if you are a dog it is
i mean ig you could use them as drums too if you're not.
Thank you for kitty climb help NODDERS
Yeah still waiting on the invite Madge
Yes I came into a Nancy spared valid run. GL on New controller run!
During my AD run I didn’t even know you could take the spiders out with the rang KEKW I was like no way I need Nancy RNG twice
Yeah I think that would def save time
if i redeem a plando seed, that includes undermiser too right Clueless
@Feli_Heli sure why the heck not LuL
you should play mm casually at some point fishShy
Did you try the cue I sent you? PauseChamp
Darn Got pillared and wetted out.
You know BITE it’ll be fine lol
Ohh that’s right the failed tutorial KEKW
is the game being enbyphobic today
Not a fan of someone glitching lolz
so is there a race going on?
I do love me some Prime
it's in my top 5 games of all time, which is Something given I don't play any other FPS
i got to the final boss of prime 1 and couldn't beat it
I'm waitin for the other two to drop tbh
I'm with ch0msky that gamecube > wii, despite the aiming being better
Do you want to know about missable scans?
I know of many of them off the top of my head
The only truly bastard scans are in Phendrana outside of Chozo Ruins tbh
oh TIL (or well yesterday technically) that the composer for the Bravely Default games also did most of the OPs for Attack on Titan :O
I was for SURE IE died
I think IE died with Win 11
Or at the very least it's not on my computer by default.
a very disrespectful death it died, as was warranted unfortunately despite its history growin up o7
it's hilarious cause I know precisely you are on the menu screen
When I was on windows I used to use a tool called sizer for this
Greatest emulator, missing a basic tool
Yeah, used to have the same issue back when I was streaming speedruns to twitch. Sizer was my solution, although I'm somewhat suprised neither dolphin nor windows native have something like it
I just gave up and full screened it tbh
but I have the monitor space to afford it
I mean windows native I kinda get cause it's kinda a basic thing lol. Most programs either aspect ratio is irrelevant or they have that built in.
gods I feel so old THIS GAME CAME OUT IN 2002
How much for Other M retro-cheevos? :P
How much to cancel out whatever Darkness wants to slap down to play Other M?
Yeah I've actually heard the gameplay is solid
I think I've never asked this: Which Metroid games have you played?
Oh damn I missed the dungeons before I could say hello
Gotcha, so this is both a RA runthrough and a casual first time beating the game then?
lemme see... Thermal Visor to Charge beam is sequence breaking
Are you going to be starting to play some of the GC games again?
Space Jump prior to boost ball is sequence but it's relatively simple if you're on 1.0.0
oh some of these achievements are *evil*
never done them on purpose I dont' think
Hard mode in Metroid Prime games is stupid. It ain't worth it, chief
hot take but the worst of Hard Mode is Omega Pirate
It's just "missiles upgrade give +2 instead of +5, everything hurts for 2x - 4x damage, your damage output is halved"
I think so, don't nail me to that part tho
The other scaling is roughly correct I'm sre
I enjoyed Prime, wouldn't put it in my favorite games ever list tho. It's def in some peoples tho.
audio sounds good vs you for now
seems fine but it's hard to tell just off the menu.
I think it's just the menu theme is quiet.
This game gets kinda loud in the first part at least
once you're outta the frigate it'll quiet down a bit
I've tried getting into the prime randos a few times. Found out I vastly more enjoy watching them played than playing myself tho
yeah prime randos are fun to watch.
I wanna try rando sometime, this game was a Special Interest ™️ for a time
this game is just a beauty!
even all this time later it still looks faboo
this coming out on Gamecube was criminal
The remaster even looks better and I thought that was gonna be impossible
I got the remake I still need to play this
Oh that's good to hear, this is one of the ones I missed on GC
Depends. The artifact hunt is endgame. Finding the artifact temple is like the first thing you do on the planet
standard of the prime series at least, maybe Super Metroid as well
It's 'hard locked' to force endgame, in that you need pretty much all of the non-optional upgrades to get there
you can sequence break this game pretty heavily tho
personally I was never a huge fan of the look and aim being separate but ig it has its benefits.
Trilogy/Wii controls handled that better, but it specifically handles tighter on the Gamecube
I mean that's basically the game, right? Scan Everything ™️
I think there's also a kbm mod for prime 1, not sure if it works with RA though
Well I like 2 more but I still love this game
but it's also the harder game considerably
I agree on 2 being superior
2 has 3 major improvements to it: Screw Attack, shooting while Grapple Beaming, and underwater navigation improvements
also it has my fave suit
idk why but I never minded the tank controls in this game ig you're nimble enough that it's never really a major issue unlike some games where turning a corner feels like the worlds most impossible challenge *cough*RE*cough*
how much to redeem a casual playthrough of 2
I think u posted to Jcog's
I never played Prime 3 how is it considered compared to the other 2?
Prime 3 is ... uh, different
I wanted to like it better despite its better controls
Prime 3 is more Halo then Metroid at times
It's very linear and more focused on story
which isn't a *bad* thing, but I liked Prime and 2 for its environmental storytelling and the feeling of loneliness
which, parts of 3 still get it, but it was still obnoxious
also 3 fed you where all the upgrades and expansions were, which I would like as an option, but not forced
as someone who played a bunch of RPGs recently I miss playing games that don't have 20 minutes of dialogue in the middle of a "timed" section.
I hate it when that happens
me when I try and get out of bed
That's why you don't cheap out on the suit that loses all it's abilities when you get knocked into a wall once... Samus.
it's basically how any metroid game starts
Well you either get the "oh no lost my gear again" cop-out, or just no explanation at all
Oh for a sec I thought that was another suit function that got lost LUL not tracking on Ridley.
It's like Zelda, these are all different Samuses
I get it, you want the people to gather up shit, but please
it may need a bit of boosting now that you're outta the frigate
You can look a bit down using R, then hold L and let go of R to get a better visual of the edge for a jump
that's the premise of Strafe Jumping or whatever it's called right
fuck yeah it sure do different thing
remember c definitely doesn't stand for camera, why would it ever be used for controlling that. That's just stupid.
it's a bit tricky to navigate at first but I do like how it stacks, it was a good translation from Super Metroid
With prime's map I sometimes run into an optical illusion where the map looks weirdly inverted / upside down
the ambience of the ruins before you get Morph Ball >
You're coming up on a rough scan by the by
Meanwhile Samus gets eaten alive reading all the lore.
the wasps for both Missiles and Morph Ball Bombs are different than the ones you have scanned and are missable
as well as the contraption that holds the missiles
you'll wanna scan in the water
not going to rule it out just yet
For this fight I usually just stare at the radar the whole time
This one is just bad and unfair in general
like why would you have to scan the *water* to get it
More options than 90% of nintendo games
you should be able to wtf
gods remaster glowed this room the fuck up
that was prime real estate. poor wasps
How do insure against a murderous space bounty hunter
everyone in chat: p r i m e
the internal name for blastcap is "chubb weed"
and for reaper vine it's "spank weed"
you are now cursed with this knowledge
one of things the sequel does better
there the drops for stuff you're missing have a vastly higher chance
the drops in this game are very strange
yeah mp1 has lower drops by far
specific rooms have set rates for drops. it's odd
drops for power bombs especially suck
meanwhile prime 2 is like "wait what if we made drops make sense"
you have a few options available ye
yeah this game doesn't care about what you currently have
some enemies can only drop certain things, and it's not universal per enemy
It's weird yeah, only certain rooms drop power bombs
which sucks for getting to the final boss as it stands
like, there are some crates that have 100% chance for missiles
the drops in this game are needlessly complicated, tl;dr
You can turn the nagging hint system off I think
it's worse in remaster I think lmao
I love me some optional hint systems tbh
I grew up on SMB3 and Sonic 2, then Pokemon
but I got a 64 and went from there
most of the games I played as a kid were 3D so I'm used to that a lot more than 2D lol
'this fucking room', all prime players say in unison about the arborium
I played Super Mario 64 so at the very least I adjusted therer
I grew up with 3d games
first game I ever played was sm64
I was born the same year the n64 came out what can I say
I was 2 when I started gamin myself
honestly I don't remember the exact first game I played but the games I played the most as a kid were Ratchet & Clank, Jak & Daxter, Sly Cooper, Okami, Pokemon XD, and Emerald.
Also NFL 2k5 but that's sports that doesn't really count.
it would have been way better if i made it 1800
yeah i made this years ago for restreams
was just messing with obs cuz of dumb frame drop issues
hopefully you can unfuck it morp
yeah i was streaming for 30m at 6k bitrate like normal and didn't drop at all
I love all the art and stuff all throughout the ruins, it makes it feel properly lived in
I mean,,,,,, they did give up their worldly possessions to ascend
so it's not THAT far off
this time, it's 🔥 instead of poison
Yes made it just in time for my fave weaponry
thankfully upgrades don't have to be scanned
I do like these kinda nested rooms
do you wanna know of expansions you may miss, too? Or just scans?
yeah you've missed a few sadly
did i miss the message that you were starting this?
do you wanna know where the other is?
you were looking straight at it a few mins ago and I was LAUGHIN
the boss that everybody spells wrong
Flaahgra has a weird spelling in fairness
it *looks* like it should have an h at the end of its name
I tried watching the sonic unleashed port, its def not for me. It was straining my eyes just watching it
when was the last time you revisited this?
@Axl_SR they buthcered the wolf and its stages to pieces
im curious to see what direction it goes in, the speedrunenrs are fawning over it from what ive seen
i was not familliar with that achievement lol
what are the good ones for this game?
this gamw is a good one as a whole
depend on how hard those sequence break are i guess
so if you play an updated version that patched stuff out you cant do the sequence achievements?
some of the speedrun sequence breaks are awful
like early power bomb with infinite speed is DUMB
you can softlock in 50 different ways lol
god yeah the sequence breaks in this game are rough
like going back to snag the artifact of sun immediately after is ass
some are bad like that yea
100% scan suck because of missables
one random enemy is permanently missable in rift
at least its not prime 2 level of missable
where you have to scan some boss up to three times LMAO
There's a few two scans in Prime but gods yeah 2 was ROUGH
one of the worst offender is a one time door scan during a miniboss fight
I still have yet to officially beat 2
my least fave missable in 1 is probably that one weirdo regional bat in Phendrana West
I really enjoy this games rando, alot of it is dependent on if you like the tank controls. It always just clicked with me, but I never liked twin stick controls anyways. It does have me nervious about what direction prime 4 goes in
2 is good just dont try to hundo it
2 isn't the worst to hundo
3 is easiest to hundo I feel likee
I am a lil concerned with 4, I imagine it'll be better on pro controller than the joycons
tho, that's just the remaster controls speaking
I didn't *hate* the remaster controls with joycon, but since I'm at an angle with my switch it's a bit weird
I didn't like 3 because it was just...too easy
in comparison to 1 and 2
i just didnt have the opportunity to really play 3
but it took out elements I enjoyed about 1 and 2
3 seems too narrative driven compared to 1 and 2 ill be honest
i think it will be less so then 3
Yeah, I do like the idea of the other hunters and all, but it took away the environmental narrative and also the free world exploration
god wilds story really quickly turned into a chore
I have to imagine it'll be more open, since they've been pushing open world exploration in other franchises
I would accept less environmental storytelling so long as they kept the open world exploration vs the linear stuff we experienced in Corruption
wonder if M4 is doing anything about their vods or do they even care?
I did not expect to see this when I clicked on the stream
I'm sure Mx4 knows by now
The only thing I know about Prime 1 is that Tommy Tallarico lied about working on this game
shoutouts to "The Room" from Dread
Tommy Tallarico also lied about working on Tony Hawk Pro Skater
No. Gotta pay for that lore
Madge this is why everyone got rid of pay as you can
yea look at mario it should launch up
this room can be very annoying
look i'm feeling good about life right now
also THPS3+4 revealed, and apparently you'll finally be able to set up custom goals for your custom park
i've been wanting that since THPS2
oh i just preordered it on PS5 and it was mentioned on the store page there lol
high score for my park: 42,069. pro score: 69,420. sick score: 696,969
That's cool. Only THPS game I played was 4 and I enjoyed it a lot.
they have given me too much power
another goal idea. the requirement is going off a really tall jump and fall into a large hole. goal name: "just die lol"
They should have brought back the monkeys for Hyrule Castle
The controller doesn't clicky clack, it's more like a difty stick
Does the boomerang z puzzle work starting top or bottom? or is there a specific one you have to start with?
I still don't understand how boomerang jumps work in this game
and this only works in the gamecube version yea?
The boomerang jumps work exactly the same way midna jumps work, except with the boomerang and not midna
Weird, I've tried to get it working on HD, maybe I'm dumb lol
But I mean, that is essentially why it works LUL
Right, but they added those mechanics because Midna jumps
I honestly didn't think about that
It's just always been in my head because it *is* essentially what midna jumping accomplishes, just in scripted locations
Ok, but then I do still rest my case LUL
It is basically like a midna jump just with boomerang and not midna, and only for some values of boomerang LUL
Why would you do that @PhantomGamesBot ?
The post office is a critical piece of infrastructure Madge
If phantom pbs I'll delete the post office holding our friend hostage
i did not form the sentence in my head
that's almost as good as, what was it, the fry randomizer?
my friend just got a card graded and got a PSA 1 the group chat is in hysterics
I love how YouTube is like a whole 10 seconds behind KEKW
ye it doesn't bother me until I noticed it LOL
I picked out a TP prize this year for Speedtember
I need to pick out some more stuff, but yea starting to get stuff organized
submissions in total? let me see
Not including my own runs, we have 21
Keep in mind, a lot of them submitted all of their runs all in one submission
No no that's totally fine, once May comes around I'll be sitting down and getting a schedule made. Since it's only gonna be 1 week this time around.
Yea submissions should end in May, schedule should be made then and well we go from there. I need to figure out how I'm gonna pull stream & audio this year, because I feel doing it through Discord wasn't great.
It might be *slightly* desync'd but that's fine.
are there more bugs in this version of the game?
Some have 12 yea, but I think faron and lan have 10
Cheer270 uh so I have 270 bits, and idk what to do with em so here ya go LOL
Oh that's the clip where he kills Eggman
no hit challenge ganondorf amiibo zora armor
good luck, you will die in one hit
You can't mash b on that and then a?
B on WiiU will always select the negative option
BIGBUGGIES says no to B Buttons ButtonMash ButtonMash ButtonMash phanto274Mash phanto274Mash phanto274Mash
am I the only one that gets extreme Metroid Prime vibes from the bugs in this game?
Hey all! gonna keep obiyoLurk phanto274Lurk tippiLurk silent1053Lurk cmdrglUrk
I think you can hookshot them in oot/mm
Oh god the game is lagging LOL
Good god the gamecube is gasping for breathe
put on tony hawk pro skater music
So when is the Phantom5800 Partner Push so we can shorten your name to Phantom oranMonka
hey I did it so can you KEKW although, full transparency, it was so fucking stressful
It'll take a while, you're at least consistent, which says a lot already
hell yeah stab him through the ass
TP AD w/ AS (ass stab)
call it ass super stab so you can abbreviate it as ASS :p
if only Link could breathe underwater :(
Crazy there's just enough time to fall to the bottom
why couldn't Link just drown before reaching the bottom so you would just have to get the zora armor lol.
this fight already kinda sucks vanilla, having to do it with limited air just makes it even more awful :(
Yeah this just looks horrible overall
cool trick to get air though
Holy BALLS it’s another Phantom stream phanto274Pacepal
Link needs to work on his broad jump
No I’ve never done that KEKW
Nah the wind is so annoying
this is taller than the tokyo tower
can the fire damage you if you walk into it?
Did you get your comfy friends espeon yet cause it came top the us site 👁️
Yea it was added a few days ago
I copped the eevee which is how I know lmao
Damn am I that predictable etchyLmao
Yea I noticed that too ):
It hates when I use firefox
No pls I want to keep firefox
casually idk I think Blizzeta is my fave.
this boss is definitely not my fave
altho the 2nd phase is fine.
It took me so long to grab the destinations backpack again
Where's my tpci connection I would like to suddenly work for pokemon thanks
Let me be the 2nd western designers :)
health is a useless resource anyway.
Esp since umbreon had already sold out
at some point when I have more space I'm prolly gonna get a plush of all the eeveelutions if they're available.
It's PMD ofc but you might want to pick a diff pink pokemon
Espeon is close to skitty but not quite you know
NOOOO i failed my 1st quest on monster hunter
PMD uses skitty + cynda for speedrun lol
oh man I played the PMD blue rescue team
I was not a huge fan of EO:TSD but I think it's generally well received too.
I was watching a YouTube exercise video and somehow as I was doing my exercise it switched to a 600 pound life video KEKW
Like “do you know what it would be like to be 600 pounds?!” like no why do you think I’m trying to exercise lmao
"this is what will happen if you don't do these exercises" LUL
It was legit a scare tactic KEKW
Cuz you didn’t practice it enough smh NOPERS
I can make up an answer if that'll help :P
clearly it's because you threw it too high and Link's neck is sore and can't look up that far.
Brb gonna lurk for a bit
what do you mean by that
let me check back in the vod to see
you were still holding down for a tiny bit after throwing the boomerang
so link walked and cancelled the target
yeah before you throw just go neutral stick
that's all you have to do to fix it
if you're short you can probably just grab the chest up here
idr if it's a 10 or 20
the one pot the boomerang didn't touch lol
I executed the dot skip segment well in my pb but I still lost 20 seconds because of this stupid spider
Yeah I don’t like the hamburger KEKW
cuz I’m hungry I still have to make dinner Sadge
I had a day old bagel for lunch today it was not a good business decision
he just doesn't agree with the clawshot location
i enjoy all the dungeons in this game
this dungeon looks completely different with glitches tbh
all of the dungeons in tp are great except palace is ok and hyrule sucks
I think palace is a bit worse than hyrule imo
palace has the superior aesthetic but way too much waiting around. at least hyrule feels short
tower climb is like the only good thing about hc
palace has a better boss too
yea palace has the best boss in the game
is this your favorite zelda game just wondering haha
and i think it being technically challenging makes up for the waiting
zant can actually do things to you unlike most of the other bosses in this game
it is impossible to die to most bosses
Nah Dangoro is best boss smh
morpheel is actually impossible to die to unless you don't have zora armor
forest temple is also the best dungeon if you are saving the monkeys
Love the content. just landed on ur channel. will be here for a while grinding college while ur grinding too.
I used to really like glitchless snowpeak until lfc was found
western glitchless snowpeak is awesome though
@Draconif fyrus is also impossible to die to, who would ever do that Kappa
jp glitchless is do spinner bomb boost do lfc you're done
there's so many cool movement strats with it what do you mean
i think my worst tp take is that arbiters is a great dungeon
I don't think that's a bad take
it just fucking SUCKS if you speedrun it
i think it's a great dungeon in speedrunning too
I should clarify that I mean it sucks because it's so easy to lose time for no reason
thats true but i just always look forward to it because i always feel like i can gold it by 20 seconds
I've been practicing spinner segment on my nights off
because I keep losing 1 minute
I also just want to do any% again lol
I'll keep doing ad for a bit though
come back and get a 2:52 fr
Come back to the dark side Df NODDERS
I can get a 2:54 without lord skip so that is my goal
my endgame was BAD in my pb
after im done with gmrta ill either do ams or any% i think
actually i need to try twilight ILs to see if theyre fun or not
i haven't seen that popup before lol
yea that popup is weird ive had it happen a few times
I should improve my ams pb because it gets lost in sacred grove
but yeah AD is fun and all but it just feels like longer any% to me
i would like to go to wii any% sometime but not yet
like if I wanna do the dungeons I will do glitchless. I think that's what I've decided
also hundo is a great category i just wish it was like 3 hours instead of over 6
me who plans to do glundo at some point
I don't have a goal time for it I just want to do it for fun
you should do regular hundo too
and hundo can't do stallord skip 🤔
when I wanted to get back into the game last year but gave up because I only had JP I 100%ed the game like 4 times
@Draconif i thought you didnt like doing the trick anyway
oh my other bad take is that hugo is a great trick
yeah i don't do it that's why I like the though of it lol
mm is the only game I've done glitched hundo for
I've done glundo of oot and master quest though (lol)
Are there any special secrets in master quest or is it just that you only get 3 hearts lol
master quest is just different dungeons
Ohh that’s kinda cool though! I never knew that
i think im not gonna go back to wii any% until i figure out aeralfos skip with pointer
worst trick in the game fr
Done with family outing and it looks like its time to visit Zantos house
Stavros did you take more pics for your pfp PauseChamo
that remind me i still need to work on the plando but monster hunter is taking all my time KEKW
i had it like 20% done
if it costing 100k points it got to be good right
oh yeah I'm supposed to practice arbiter's
i'm modding my wii u rn so i might not chat a lot
but i wish you the best of luck
Zant is also just kinda a fuck
Noodles sound good tbh, in some fashion
yknow it always astounds me how much time passes in that cutscene
like so little happens it feels so short
It's very dramatic to make a giant wall fall
yo amish ty for the gl
yo Lopez ty for the gl
Love this guy tho despite the problems he gives
Wind Waker also has some nice rain soundwise
And it's so *quiet* with the rain as the only sound. It's so aesthetic for setting up the castle
a lot of zelda games set up hyrule castle as the scary hard dungeon, but in TP that's palace really. This game's hyrule castle is a different vibe and I really like it. Somber.
Especially with all the dead guards
yeah I feel like palace is the final dungeon and hyrule castle is an extended pre-finale story sequence
to just nail home the feeling of loss.
It kinda feels like the Moon, in some senses
this place is just a pass along to check to see if u have all the items
Like you kinda just go for it and have this foreboding feeling, but you can detour ans you get asked about yourself if you seek out FD. It feels like acceptance, in some facet
you only need 26 if you miss once. you should be good otherwise with 25
@Amishman19 okay but the miss is a strat it saves time
@nahtanojrepus depends which phase you miss
honestly once I got told about the EMAIL ME thing I can't unhear it
Gregorian chanting in this fight >
@Nahtanojrepus true that hahaphd drilled it into me
I love the laughing to sudden seriousness so much, I never get sick of it
the new controller has finished a run.
Oh hm. They eventually took out the sword from him I just realized
@FatPidgeyBirb nah they dragged his whole corpse to the sacred grove and put the sword back with him still skewered on it
will be a minute, need to wash dishes and refill water bottle, etc
Dont worry buddy 🫡 take your time
I’m dying at the video in general. I needed a good laugh this weekend KEKW
This is true but then the counter is ratting you out for being messy lol
I want to run but I found out my parents are getting divorced so my headspace is not where I want it to be phanto274S
what do you feel like trying to play
I’m also trying to get ahold of my mom but she’s not answering and it’s annoying me lol
just take the gate down Clueless
you know me so well lmfao
my new AD pb dies to blizzeta
I got my goal time but dying to blizzetta is...
well see, they started with goombario
and then spent 10 hours mourning that
well i have reason to actually say "thank you shaq" now lmao
well i've been craving chicken tenders and he apparently opened a chain of chicken restaurants called big chicken and i finally tried it and the chicken tenders were EXACTLY what i was craving lmao
size, consistency, breading amount, just perfect lol
I have free will and I will judge you
Wouldn't the BiT be done DURING the attempt?
Well your title says AD attempts AFTER a bit
Oh. I should have read it as ADvertisement?
@SwiftPichu_ wasn't expecting to see you in dtraitors chat the other day
Phantom knows I used to run sa2
you have a lot more chill there phanto274Wave
Yeah because there's no one there that's degen
You are not excused thank you
I never liked the mist games
Holy balls I can’t believe there’s a noob in chat
Holy shit there's a fucking trash toxic player in chat
I died to blizzeta today I'm ultra noob
I die to blizzetta every playthrough bc I lose so much health to the room after LFC
in my case I ran into her twice and died
Blizzetta as I see it is hit or miss
The timing of that line omg KEKW
Yo on data just stopping by to say hi no internet until Monday
Go fuck yourself until Monday tiger
You know swift I can still time out on mobile KEKW
The sentiment will linger on bitch
Don’t time out just full ban NODDERS
Phantom remind me to ban mid
By the way watching a friend play xenoblade 3 so I'm waiting for chapter 5 to happen to watch their soul die in real time
By the way how's the run running
Yo, maybe we do ams races some time now that I'm an ams gamer
I would do an ams race
considering my current pb gets lost in sacred grove for 2 minutes
I'll get last every time but I have fun doing it
doesn't have a lot of bs in it
the bad thing about it is just armogohma rngh
I learned a few interesting things about gohma
most of my shinies were female so the game said happy women's day too
a lil tad tped out so will be in and out gl on everything
hope ur day has been awsm birb
@stavros12c34anenoglou I'm doin alright, ty, hope your day goes well too stav
5 shinies for like 20 mins of play was pretty neat
Always good to see you live!
this is it, this is the one, this is it, this is the run ♪
I still use you paper mario randos to pass out at night. They are a thing of beauty
I always end up in awe everytime I see you do a run in any of these games. Speed running is such a foreign concept for me
I tried paper mario randos but I think my brains just a bit too smooth to do it well.
that's a mood, only rando I've gotten moderately decent at was Wind Waker
but I do love MM and Pape, tho I don't play em a lot
My main problem is I don't tend to invest on speed tech
My first ever rando attempt is still my best time to this day at 6.5 hours. Cant even get sub 7 and I think I know more now than I did on that first run. I dont think speed runners get enough credit for how simple they make it look.
a lot of it is routing/sphere knowledge too, in addition to the speed shit
Yeah. I never could get the tracker to fill in for me properly without a lot of messing around.
📝 never understood how that worked
I might do some image recognition stuff for console trackers
items show up long enough on the text box to where you can do it
the weird thing is figuring out what key you just picked yp
do autotrackers have color tolerance in programming? That's neat
@FatPidgeyBirb they do if you program them to
Id be building it from scratch if I do it
like I did my auto tracker for dolphin
only reason I haven't done so yet is cuz I don't really want to atm
Yeah I have to imagine you'd need some sort of way to track hue differences and shit, still cool in theory
like a freak magic wand tool
yeah, but if it was implemented
its how fast the text box vanishes in rando
since you said it wasn't, I said 'in theory', knowin that stuff exists even if not programmed in now
OCR would just read all the text on the screen for me automatically
the item icon always shows up in rando too
so I can always check that spot
I'm an illustrator so I'm thinkin from an art program
well, the image recognition doesn't look at art like we do
what are some of the harder achievements in this?
they look at the raw pixel values
there's some pretty gross sequence breaks
oh I more meant challenge playthrough stuff, but if you don't know anything that's fine
actually i've never played any metroid game
stuff like 98% no space jump
hard mode is pretty whatever, its just enemies have more health and you take more damage
so if you know the game already it's just longer and not any different
what are you doing to the children
I guess under 3:30 IGT is a pretty good achievement
DF isn't that the time zoid said was his "speedrun" before the game came out
I've been training an ai to learn how to play smash bros brawl endless with nothing but images
that would be a funny reference
under 3:30 wouldb e hard for me
image recognition has come a long way
I forget what ch0m's record is
wow df echoes has some cool achievements
"defeat chykka in under 2 minutes and 15 seconds"
that's a very specific amount of time
I wonder if I could do that without seekers
oh I misread, 2:15 is adult only
I thought metroid music was all dark ambience
any5 is a lil over an hour
I can beat adult in 5 seconds
is there an achievement for doing item loss skip
doesn't prime 1 have an sjf one?
it's beat the game, time challenges for each boss, beat the game on hard mode, and get all scans
oh also a sub 4 hour completion
sub 4 for echoes is tough...
collission in t his game is funky
don't think I can sub 4 echoes either
Echoes is a tougher game and the better game overally
I wanna play echoes again soon I really want to grind for 49
honestly if I played again I think I could get 47. my 48 is pretty good but the beginning was really bad
20 seconds lost in the first 13 minutes kill me
prime 59 wouldn't take that long either I think. just gonna not do the stupid stuff and rely on movement to get it
and that should make it not too bad
you have the prime 2 fundamentals you should be able to get sub hour
just do mostly inbounds but do ibbfaf or something
Just got back from my job interview
I wish I understood what anyone was saying
this is a good game though you should try it
they're speeddrunning nerds, that is the translation
It went well, I hear back from them next week
@nozomup you're a tp runner right? I think I recognize the name
I don't usually run prime 1, but prime 2 is my bread and butter
dont even have to emulate then
phantom forgot physics after being a ghost for so long
it is time for you to learn the way of bomb jumping young phantomo
yeah you should learn horizontal bomb jumps (that don't go horizontally at all)(
we are very good at naming things
lmao I was gonna make the same joke
could be worse, could be named how Celeste tech is named
we also have a trick called uber bomb jump
don't forget Really Good Bomb Jump
I will personally fight whoever decided to name shit like 'coosting'
is that supposed to be "coasting" but playful or something
need i forget we call out of bounds "secret worlds"
and then there's chaining tech, reversing tech, etc so you get some *really* fucked up names
there is a technique in wii called spring john bomp
Spring ball is in remaster too
yeah it's a remastered tech too
spring balling right before a bomb explodes gives you an insane amount of height
I struggle with it, I'll stick to basic bomb tech like a basic bitch
so instead calling it a spring bomb jump, I called it a spring john bomp
df remember when we found that space jump early setup on remastered
and the videos blew up with people saying we cheated
there was one comment on my SJF video that was like "too much text explain with voice"
I tried for like 45 mins outta curiosity and I couldn't get it, I musta missed it
place bomb 2 right before bomb 1 explodes
you can space the final 2 bombs much closer as well
you have learned a double bomb jump
You play any new games recently?
I've dabbled in a little bit of world
nice. Never tried a Monster Hunter game I prolly should at some point. Been playing KC:D2 and Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon recently. The latter is in EA but it's been pretty fun, heavily influenced by Skyrim for anyone that wants a game like that.
I have some friends who play a lot of mh, I was gonna try the new one
but holy moly it just doesn't run, my friends didn't grab it either
to make a shitpost sloppy photoshop edit
I did get the two older ones on pc though
I've heard there's a simple code line you can change to make it better, but it's an unofficial fix
nah there's some fundamental stuff going on with asset streaming, turning camera and stuff
I'm too picky so I could never enjoy it unfortunate
I just like playing games at high refresh, low input lag etc
so when the demo booted up and its like "turn on frame generation?" I got bad vibes instantly
I upgraded to 32gb recently and a 3060 12gb, it was very nice
yeah I have a 11900k/3060ti I made like 3 years ago, I'll upgrade again in a couple years
still really happy with it, this gpu was so good for the price
previous I was running a poor 960m laptop 😆
I feel like the monetary jump between 3060/4060 stuff just isn't justified for the performance difference, even as someone who does 3D stuff/unity work
AV1 video encoding on the 40 series is nice though.
iis this a non gay channel ?
mine was a 1060 rtx before so 3060 was a nice upgrade
For one I am here so that makes this gay by default by me being here
ii thought i was going to have a good time
so much gay here I am being oppressed 😭
I put the cheers in queers and all that
fuckin excellent use of rainbow dicks
I love this room. I wonder what it was like before nuclear winter descended on this place
ssup dudes with a penchant for men to men lore relatated stuff
tthe fudge is going on my male born men
adding "non gay" to my future theoretical no out of bounds stream
someone a couple weeks ago streamed echoes with "no oob no pronouns" in the title
and I thought it was gold
on pal onward these guys have like double health
iif any trap would be a trap a she gothtrap is up there
mmama ones to be more accurate
the drop system in this game isn't the best
the drop table is based on what room you are in currently
and some of the choices they made are pretty suspect
echoes is smarter in that it takes into account what you have
like if you're under 20% HP, you have an 80% chance of an ultra energy drop
or 80% for 10 missiles if you have 0 missiles, or 80% for a power bomb with 0 power bombs etc
yeah normally they expect you to have more than 25 missiles I imagine by now
25 is pretty reasonable here tbh
I'm the chronic collectathon nerd in games, so I always get here with like, 60
except it doesn't have a flared base
made it in time o see my fave armor comin up
how u liking it so far?
@stavros12c34anenoglou that's not for a while iirc
Phantom just got wave, I think it's post third beam you see second armor upgrade
I always forget about the unique music in this room
this room has a unique version of the "puzzle" song
but this room can just be jumped up without doing anything, so you don't get to hear it outside of casual playthrough
oh I thought I was being gaslit and hearing a different version of Phendrana
I got the W but Azura got a PB and was close, was in P2 final as I finished
Yeah, Amishman finished when I was getting Peach Beam. So close!
God this game looks stunning for the GameCube
this game looks *so* goddamn good
honestly 480i on crt looks even better
Retrotink 4k putting in work monadoChad
@fatpidgeybirb dangit, now I'm hungry! *points*
Stupid autocucumber, that was supposed to be "pouts"
Oh and turning in the Vase was necessary. Lol
I love this room it's so cool
Seems like nothing bad will happen now
I thought there was one more :Va that alluded to Prime 2
did you plug your input display into your pc or do you just use different controllers for playing on dolphin?
I have a mayflash and it doesn't work doing that for some reason, no idea why
I think it works for others
and I don't want to use PC mode because it functions differently with mappings
I don't practice much on dolphin anyway
I've used Mayflash before, it's touchy
that's my last 3 braincells be nice to them
surely Phazon Metroids aren’t that bad
Same reason they blocked the save station
they don' want Samus gettin through at any cost
that’s where my music is from EZ
yeah the Pirate dip can suck
they really want you to missile I guess
getting back out is half the challenge of getting safely to thermal, I suppose
They do warn about it in the guidebook, I remember
how it feels to goron roll
everything looks Thermal beam to me
metroids are obnoxious till you get ice
this part of the game fucks
this was probably one of the first spooky segments i experienced in a game as a kid
this game definitely has some terror aspects to it
always an amusing sound from that room
I forgot how much this fight sucks
couldn't imagine doing it without thermal
SUch a beautiful game the bosses so exquisite.
oh no u reached ur gameplay limit?
thepri67Wave phanto274Wave tippiWave cmdrglWave thanx for epicness
You ever thought about an origami dick?
@SwiftPichu_ First thing I see when I join, this gonna be good
Did you change your Webcam res or something? I'm seeing more fps at least
I'll go fuck myself then, excuse me
Yeah, that checks. My Mining session in Star Citizen got shoved forward an hour in Discord but I sure as heck wasn't expecting it
I want to break out of this damn icebox. It's about to feel like spring but I gotta get through tonight first
Phantoms thoughts exactly when rolling this seed
Oh, gimme a sec, gotta flop my monitor
eh so which settings are NOT on?
Wait, WTF? I just flipped the monitor....hang on I'll put it ba....wait... frick
I don't know what would be worse, complete mirror, or this where it's random
When random settings go too far apparently. And here I thought inverted Metroid Prime 2 worlds was weird
the mirroring is making my brain lumps hurt
Still waiting on the new set
2 out of 3 turtles already
You can do it, just gotta SNIFFA it out.
i love how para is lifting mario but has a lot of issue doing it
so phantom what possessed you to do *gestures wildly* this
These look like some settings lol
its either this or play minecraft
Yeah mario stop being a bitch
Can't wait for a hammer or bomb to  be here
All the collective money for a can of soda
got my prep for st.patty day meal
Seems like pretty normal behavior for a raphnet adapter
Was it just moving on it's own?
That's just a feature of the raphnet
I've had 2 raphnets for wii guitar hero controllers and both had the same issue you're having
I am so confused why are some maps flipped?
It's one of the rando settings
It will either be mirrored or regular
Let’s see you get past the chapter MadgeRn
um excuse me mx strimmer, did u kno u can jump out of spins to save time?
oh *ew* the map is flipped, I always forget this is a thing
You can also use the whale now
Oh did shit cheeto have bombette
So we just need sushi to clear most of chapter 5
How many stars for haven access?
theoretically couldn't you spam power shock to beat fuzzipede? or is power shock too expensive?
Found out today there's a halal chicken and burger place opening literally right around the corner from my house
I am blessed to have so many banger local restaurants within walking distance
I can’t believe we’re watching the rando WR rn
did I just walk into marcoMode
So about that castle key you mentioned...
Why are you working the turtle so hard smh
I gotta dog. He was abandoned
I remember when this was a flutter noises stream :(
Since there is a lul in the rando action I guess i will ask this. Are u really that serious into Bomberman as ur next adventure and run Ice?
Yeah, I eventually wanna learn BM64
Phantom is it bad I’m yet to make more than 12k channel points and I feel like I’m in your stream all the time KEKW
I need to stop redeeming yugioh
Alright then ill take the awkward penalty in ur chat board then bc i dont get along with any of there community members.
That kid won't accept this mail that has their name on even in the jungle?  Madness, I'd say.  MADNESS
I had a run that was 1:44 ahead and died to Null & Void :)
But Risch, no one dies to Null and Void
jugoomba shaking in his boots after that stream
Only 2 Prisms, both got eaten by them, and then by the time I drew LifeSword as a backup, I was at 60 hp and moved into one that teleported onto me
And he had just queued up a PA, it was sad
if this wasn't on the nintendo online, this game might have getting the switch remake instead of thousand year door.
I know you picked up the real one
But you should check it incase
Is that enough to fight Jr?
Not that bad an option with 8 in toybox yeah
The incentive is you get to skip it later YEP
We just got a letter I wonder who it’s from Hmm
oh wow toy box is flipped around
The child gave part of herself to you
GL, ill be back in a bit talk about my league race
Yo finally have pc set up
at least it matches the dungeon. There aren't just random magikoopa
so I did a solo banjo seed, its a bit better with hints now. I run 15 out of 60 so not every hint sign is a handout. Then I did my first league race with Mazarus. Seed was very fast. Hit go mode at 1:10 but end game fights were very rough. Ended with a 2:05 with rushing last 3 chapters + ch8 taking nearly an hour.
don't you you still need star stone to beat that?
because I forgor dungeon entrance rando was on
i love it as it is, would not change a thing LUL
I personally didn't mind the prime control scheme when I played through it
liked echoes more than the first one though
also partner upgrades were the worst. I only found like 4 of them
the only good one was dizzy shell being 1 FP and I didnt have any reason to use it lol
i joined on a whim cause they needed one more for even teams. I already regret my decisions
these settings arent great for "races"
which settings are you talking about (I kinda have no idea what is even on for s3/4
fully random is just too much
don't talk about my kid like that, he's narrating.
What about the other watchtower? Or is that more of a pointless turret lol.
the solo banjo tooie rando had its logic added in the latest release
the one with the big ass ladder that Auru is on I meant. Does that not count as a watchtower? lol.
laki is going to be behind that red jar
saw a post that made me laugh in Pape AP, "When can we expect a poptracker update by Phantom? the last ID change broke the tracker pack which just says random stuff now". Me laughing to myself, "thats a good question considering they dont check this channel" LUL
also goin to phanto274Nom ghunzoNom obiyoNom NomNom
I also ran into a issue with emotracker autotracking, but I dont remember what it was so it cant be that important LUL
HUH people use a tracker for pape
"What emulator do I need to use for the APPM64? It doesn't seem to open on Project 64?" Very next message: "thats your patch file"
Do you have all the Fortress Keys you've seen? I remember you skipping one early on
could you technically do staircase skip to skip a fortress key but it would be out of logic
Kid would you take this letter off of my hands, it's addressed to you.  No?
oh did you only have 1 key on your first vist to the fortress than?
couldn't you than have done staircase skip than activated the shortcut past the 3rd key and than use that to get back up and skip the 2nd key
couldn't you still check jail+pit though
Man why is it that there's nowhere that sells meatloaf in the supermarket
6 is a lot of checks
I'm back, how have we not found the cloud turtle
Surely they're both just in 6 at this point though, right?
I love throwing channel points into an open fire
back that was good and 4 hr mark
Might be bad news for the believers but we'll see
I am still callen it laki is going to be on red jar turn in
So basically if laki isn't vanilla or moles I lose phanto274Cry
I need to save my luck for the end of the month
Both for Quarter Century Stampede and well for something else
Now here's a fun question Which comes first ultra hammer, or laki
You could kill 1 bit and  block 0
the king has let us passed for this rando
It's kinda nice seeing CK not being a total dick on power shocks
Go beat 2 and then you can finish Koot
Scarf would be nice so you don't have to sushi glitch up the mountain again
At least radio + melody is good synergy
So where is this elusive Turtle in a Cloud
Sing a melody get a letter to Goompapa for the Turtle in a cloud
I love when my turtles are locked behind doing tasks for an older turtle
So go mode was locked behind a melody
GreyGoose is hitting real good. and yeah marcoMode
after you finish this seed I recommend taking 300mg of Fukitol KEKW
fave character became my 2nd fave boss KEKW
i just got here and my eyes are confused
who is this for exactly KEKW
Deadge been sleeping on a couch for the pass 2 days getting a new Bedge and its gonna be here in 2 to 7 business days
the couch also sucks ass KEKWait
i am really hoping it come in 2 business days (tuesday) YEP
also lost a part to my monitor mount Sadge
just saw the stupidest arcade stick I've ever seen in my life
It's an aluminum arcade stick with support for 20 different consoles
Also it has 10 Dreamcast VMUs built in
oh and no insta-warp to the door?
don't have to do door minigames, but still have to traverse
that bothered me on a spiritual level
oh hell no, not actual quiz questions
Frankly that bothered me and I've done that trick less times than most
they are all the same colors to me LuL
what'd the bot call me ? ? ?
can we never do that again k thanks
Cheer100 Shadow: Where's that damn fourth Chaos Emerald?
@buff00n do you want a fight stick with 10 built-in dreamcast VMUs?
that was an amazing cutscene lmao
Cheer100 Bits for the bits train
@buff00n look at this stupid thing I'm about to dm you
just finished updating my budget and found some monies lying around
how come I didn't get gifted a sub? It's unfair :(
Be dover is an epic p0rn marcoStar
@Darkness3827 it's not letting me gift you a sub. I think Twitch is broken
once I started keeping a budget I literally saw $2k just sitting there
@lordofduh Try gifting a tier 3 that might fix it :P
If this reversed the hallway fight too...
oh hey thanks for the gift phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
Did you never find Power Bounce or is it bad?
Oh, uh, I think some of the stuff in the bottom right isn't updating
Tell me where the game hit you to do glundo
I know asking this is a stretch but... Do you know any stories about the great video game crash of 1983?
I used to work with a guy that was around for it, he had some cool stories but naturally i dont remember them
I just think its a cool topic that most people would find interesting
tomorrow Im doing 2 races with Adam phanto274S
who is winning the first redeems btw?
16 races in 2 months, gotta start the crunch
i could be at way more KEKW but you know
im running out of points btw
so name redeems need to come from others for a while
My plans got canceled today so I told Peaches its a good day for minish cap
but i am gonna be -100k whenever i go back to making the plando
the plando i was working on was about 20% done YEP
yeah for that point cost, if it was 75-80K id be more willing
I've been making a few changes to the formatting so it's easier for me to read lmao, idk if I also made changes in the doc I sent you
yo tiger ty for the gl
is this where we come for God's intended category?
Yo lopez ty for the gl
yo pp ty for the gl
What's the lore behind this meme?
Yo blopez Ty for the gl and always hitting the 😺 emoji
still haven't found my missing piece for my monitor mount Madge
have you tried to MacGyver it yet
I was meaning to add the counts at the end of each chapter so I can catch up easier when I inevitably start missing them
i could buy a replacement part for 18 bucks or the whole thing again for 45 YEP
do you know if you're going to rpglb
I'll be in Denver for a few of the days so if you get in on a day I'm there I'd watch
ooh no vaporeon leafeon glaceon or sylveon yet
Then you probably want to be hired YEP
hello goat gl with the runs today
yeah its, hard to read especially on stream lol
can't type my phone cUsse hand too et from showver
Well what do we have someone actually celebrating Mario
i heard we gotta get a fire bar, specifically one of them.
when you feel like resetting it's important to remember what the wise Hokage Naruto once said:
"LMFAO dude I kissed Sasuke AND bagged Hinata and we made a baby how fucking sick is that?"
is there a way to swim faster in minish cap?
ambassador program was pretty cool, then the internet told me it was bad and i never used it again LUL
thats like 30 x 7 days
i forgot how long it takes for the 360 to download things lol
i heard the switch 2 should have wifi 6 at least
i remember getting a red xbox 360 for my bday back in 2009 monkaSTEER
i misinterpreted glundo as gl hundo
gl is always good luck for me unfortunately
Madge found a lg gold crown monster and he left the area before i could save the quest
you always seem so much happier playing this than TP
I'm so glad they fixed this for rando
that would be extremely painful for hammerless when you just have bombette
kooper is bad to but bomb lady would be worse
Did you know... In japanese, Bombette's name is "Pinky" and her body slam move is called "PINKY ATTACK"
yo good luck, I’ll be working and lurking
I had to practice desert and forest cleanly a few times in the week to make it muscle memory
I want to get green station and the sewers section at the end
to be muscle memory like that
I'm pretty sure there's a cycle you can hit but it's really tight
I think my 3 attempts had 6, 7, and 7
need that in regular glitchless fr
Would you fuck a rat or a dragon?
today is a great day to watch a glundo
thats probably the only reason why i prefer flurries gale force is it gives you star points
gl on every other rng check
ahh because of peril strats im guessing
you have to go further right before going down
yeah I always miss the 10c block in ch4
or where you hit it from?
you don't have to hit the shy guy
oh lol well mine does too then
I'm on mobile rn or I would lolll
maybe I'll try this room with a zoomed out cam or something
I wonder if you need to one spin to the box on the way back
how is it 101% when you dont make soapcake?
Can I ask a dumb rando question?
At the beginning of each seed, you talk to FiceT and he gives you something. But he never does when I try. What setting am I missing?
ahh, yeah i imagine the varience can be frustrating for this catagory
It's unsettling how she never turns the stove off, how has this lady's house not burned down yet?
@TheWitchyHazel she just never stops cooking
if your born with the name tayce T its your destiny
Well at least she seems happy in her labors
what happens when strimmer starts making mistakes?
wait why is merlon still standing outside his house? KEKW
It's amazing how mathed out this run is
Yooo Phantom, happy mario day! phanto274Heart
yeah just need reps of reating correctly
i got the star piece in the water and just left lmao but i realized after i took the lz
i'm still downloading a game on my 360 how is this so slow
it's lost odyssey, i never actually downloaded it to my 360 so i'm doing that now so i can back it up in case they make a recomp for it like with unleashed
i played that game once couldn't get into it
i also have blue dragon lol
i got mine from maddy's brother who was getting rid of it lol
offered it to us, so why not
@Mirby_Studios now that a good game
idr how many i had but i do know i had two in ch1 lmao
okay it just jumped from 80% to done lmao
i remember playing blue dragon one time and look at the time and said what the fuck its 4am
5PM hit and the 360 went "okay time to stop throttling"
Allergy season is kicking my ASS rn
so you have a natural defense against people telling you to touch grass, that's great
I need to get prepared bc soon I'll be suffering
I got a Frosty Ice Kirby plush
i should figure out where that guy moves to lmao
i think if no all or nothing then we can skip jungle rebadge but i'll have to list 2 separate ones probably
2nd fave has arrived on the scene what does petey have to say
yeah like 360 going into sewers
yeah straight right i think that might just happen sometimes
i didn't see it tho lol
i think there was nothing you could do there lol, i think it helps to walk a frame first but you can still 4 spin going above
this fucked me up too lmao, i should make it more readable
probably 2 tries if i had to guess since you need bombette anyway
hardest item to get in this glundo or hardest thing to accomplish in this glundo
i just realized i never bought the spagonia DLC for unleashed
i got the rest of the DLC just not that one for some reason lol
yeah i was just thinking that
you can still buy 360 games via browser on PC then download on 360 even though the store is shut down
backwards compatibility on the Xbone and Series X/S
they have to keep the 360 games up on the browser for thsoe
Oh hey, Xbox, I know this stuff
whats funny is maple syurp repel gel life shroom and shooting star supposedly have a worse drop rate then jammin jelly on lil oinks
Stuff that isn’t backwards compatible is still installable from the 360 if it’s in your purchase history and hasn’t been hard delisted entirely, but you can’t get anything you have bought/downloaded before
yeah it took me a bit to find download history on my 360 lol
BC stuff is still available through the modern Xbox store (on Series X essentially), which is why it’s also available on the website
and then it took like 3 fucking hours to download lost odyssey
if they do announce a nuts and bolts recomp i am gonna actually buy that lol
i literally read that and then went below 360 coins 10 seconds later
Yeah, 360 download speeds are atrocious. Took me days to download everything back when the store went down, which was only like a couple hundred gigs
Viva Pinata does have a GFWL version, but Trouble in Paradise obviously doesn’t
I bought a GFWL disc of Viva Pinata recently just because I could, lol
i recently switched from xbox to gc and im actually not sure how i feel about gated stick
what makes this 101% vs 100%
so its just 100 with req optional miniboss
the blocks are kinda fast compared to like selling
tossing would be faster still by like 2s
heart block is like 2s, toss is like 1.5s, eating is like 5.2s
would have to time exactly what the drink animation is but tossing would still be faster
Truly a joy on the day
it's supposed to be give lyrics to simon right
oh so red house is melody?
I preordered a physical version of the Croc Remake back in novemeber. Finally today is the last day to preorder so hoping that it ships soon
reminder than quizmo doesnt care about your splits
how many coins do you need for badges
sell repels and honey candy i think will be good
yeah honey candy sells for 15 and repels sell for 30 at harrys shop
oh there's only one spare repel right
if you need goomba village shooting star sells for 20 at south
hey phantom gl with the hundo...1?
it was good played kh2 rando for the first time in 7 months
uhhh its kinda like if chapter 4 was locked by the end of chapter 7 being locked behind 4th ruins key  that was locked behind saving the yoshis in terms of logic
Yo gl with the end of the glundo Phantom!
do you know if bony beetles can first strike you with their spiky attack
oh you need 8 fp for final
fan smack would be too much
unless you still have honey candy
oh lol actually you can fan smack, i didnt account for the 2 fp outta sight
just need to race again surely
nah you could with this route im sure and some good quizmos
Just press A the mash session phanto274Mash
I lost like 9 mins for free and I'm sure I could save another 5 from playing better
just being more familiar with the route
someone summon Malleo back to do a glundo TAS
random are you gonna submit your run to lb or nah
thats like 2 runs a day wdym
what’s M4’s pb? I forget if I got record lol
i think m4 is 10s faster
I’m pretty sure I’ll come back to glundo one day
especially would this route being better
depending on what 6:1x grind is like I'll consider trying 6:0x
none of those were record i think lmao, pretty sure m4 first run was sub 7
I remember thinking I’ll submit once I beat m4’s time, and then I stopped lol
m4 in october, random in december 2023
Today Chrono Trigger is 30 years old
my new Bedge is here well my mattress still waiting on Bedge frame
Hello, how long have you been speedrunning on this Zelda?
The trick is just that dogshit
Imagine if you miss WR by 1 frame
And you coulda had it if you broke the box perfectly
I would 100% delete my twitch
unless its ur own record that u tie u shouldnt shame for not reaching anothers by a sec but that said by a non runner.
Wish I could pick up a rock and it shits out a dollar
yeah the polygon or ingame matter doesnt matter on ur gate phasing but in oot and mm digits can effect the way things work and ww
Staring straight into that keese's soul
Maybe that why his mouth was open...
Chuckie not a care in the damn world
It's chrono trigger's 30th birthday today
HolidayPresent HolidayPresent HolidayPresent PartyPopper PartyPopper PartyPopper The firs game to introduce multiple endings
living example over here, I am pretty sure SMW and Link to the past are older then I am phanto274Lurk
also gl with the runs PrideFlower
I play Z1 and Z2 and they came out 86 and 87 lol
I played Z1 as the NES classic GBA game PrideLaugh
I'm so sorry to hear that Jon
tried Z2, but fuuuuck that game got some stupid decisions in it
@Iceblue I also did 2nd quest KEKW
he didnt get to have those noises in the PAL cartridge dafuq?
that being said I probably woulda been fine w it - not like TMC link is any less loud KEKW
LTTP I know did it yea
kinda blanked it out, as said: TMC Link sword spam and such
fuck having to do Map glitch in the GBA LTTP to reach the 4sword dungeon if you dont have ppl to play that with btw
I refuse to watch runs of that cause uhhh... yeah that sword swing  noise
guess I just grew numb to those types of repetitive noises - they dont phase me near as much as if say, sudden extremely loud outta nowhere does these days
so why is this bulblin called hugo?
I only know of HuGo the Hungry Goron in majoras
the fact this works is wild to me
Ik Skyward and TP use Back in time a bunch yea, think the biggest restriction Windwaker got is the quadrant / island system?
not necessarily think it would immediately get used unless it lets you get off an easier superswim over outsets given no sword / shield
like - you'd then have to have access to something for the early game
cus like.. swordless gohma I dont think anyone would want to do
wanted to say, the flag setting to immediately access iron boots before first twili section is big as well
therefore not having the dire NEED to repair a bridge via portals, having to dedicatedly go back just to get irons
note to self: back in time is hilarious for existing
skyward sword back in time is wild yea
so.. this jump has to be done cus while you got sword and shield, the gmae is stupid flags wise and wants you to complete the sword/shield gathering here?
and with this jump stuff you're doing, you can barely get past the blocking barrier?
shield shouldnt be the issue yea - I mean, this is the hylian, not the ordon or wooden shield
come to think I renember seeing that from when you do the switch to zora armorat argorok
which is hilarious then that the model loads in with phantom equips
while at the same time using those to put items out of the system
counterpoint which I dont necessarily get though
why not make sure the items in question are just flags for the item rather then tied to a story state
like - that bit I dont get
who in their right mind would do shit like that
I know I shouldnt ask - I mean, this is clearly not the first time a nintendo game has shown these weirdnesses
but like.. why do it like that, just tie the item to a unique "did get item?" flag *shrugs*
technically yes, practically could also just make it a per item "did get item" flag
no need to dupe it at that point, just ask the game if that's been ticked, if yes: dont spawn in, if no: spawn in
curious to hear where nintendo spagetti coded then
either way sounds like big restrictions, though still dont wanna believe every piece of code was used efficiently PrideLaugh
as much as it is all technically used up and such
Good afternoon and good luck on each and every dungeon!
and not necessarily in a always good way
like... at that point, you got some weird issues you're workin around
too bad this is a no reset, that box break trick might be a run breaker
I guess I am more surprised then I should be really
then again I wanna still stand by "nintendo might not have done the best coding job" given what all ppl by now have found out about the N64
where while it was super restricted in what you had available to work with, they did not use it 100% efficiently in some cases leading to hilarious side effects and shit
so like - my brain wants to believe that as much as they did utilize everything available, it might not always have been in a smart way
ya still get what I am tryin to get to tippiThink
fair enuff on that end - 100% take being super silly there
hugos hopped up on coffee and he's all out of adhd meds
I hope someone pees in his lemonade
ok I hate how well timed that was with link standing still lookin at whatshisface's stick
the subtitles are fighting between calling it gate clip and gay club
no resets until I decide to reset
you should reset in the marathon
will there be a donation incentive to put claw on x
Seeing as you skipped cutscene "NOT TAKE MIRROR"
I need to expand my tp collection
I have a wii disc that probably doesn't work anymore
2 english discs, 1 barely worksx
my first jp disc loads very bad because it's got some scratches over the years
it loaded 10 frames slower on average compared to my english disc looool
but my new jp disc actually loads 3 frames faster on average to my english disc
jp is probably faster for any% for me but uh yeah fuck wolfos jump
I respect it though it's ugly
I believe it's still faster even if you pause to unequip it later
but in this category you have no reason to unequip it
you need to look at the ground homie
Gl, is MOOFIN time for birbs. And dishes but yanno
I spy a needy kitty! So eepy
I wish I could see more than 3 pixels but alas, phone jail
You did send me a pic of him earlier while I was on my walk! I love he
I commend u for sending it while speedrunning that's some dedication to the cat tax
You ever thought how breedable zant is?
Or fucks to fuck in this case
is ams just the ending portion of AD
thats the same order in which I do the ms runs though
unless im like running an old route
am I supposed to be using them in other places in ams
cuz you need water bombs for refills
I've been kinda having issues with ams recently
for some reason im never happy with my spr sequence
always some stupid ass time loss
I found you cannot hit him more than twice or he will block ball and chain every time
thats the only darknut like that in the game
hes also the only one that blocks after 4 hits
I just learned the other way to line it up
I had it on in the bg and it sounded like Hugo was rude
you can start 3 minutes later
phanto274GL  hope you're having a good day
God I need to play this game again
Yeah that's the boat I'm in
I'll comms bn6 if you comms bn2 LUL
Oh I didn't even see the last run wtf
I gotta derust a game I haven't run in 4 years
Oh btw, Power up with Pride submissions are live too
I highly doubt I'm getting in for that
They hate z2, and bn2 is not a strong submission
Yeah I was weirded out by that
that spider's name is apparently "Myhouseisonfire"
Yeah phantom, get on the bus
bbl going out to eat. maddy and i haven't had a "date night" type deal in a while so why not now
ems is why i dont play this game lol
ems and s&ss is why I run ams
phantom i need to go to sleep, gn ily and gl
I'm wondering if the bonk is due to late timing of the jump attack
i run ams cuz im bad at game
i take it all dungeons didn't work out?
Mr Phantom I couldnt help your Legend was of Zelda
It seems be pretty of Midna ATM
making someone do their first TPR on monday
they played vanilla for the first time like half a year ago lol
im really good at staring at the groud
the annoying thing about banjo is i turn the camera to the wall to reduce lag but the camera shifts so I have to keep turning it back
my nose couldnt tell the difference
i swear i cant play good or consistently for shit
i want to be good so bad is my problem probably
desire to be good is fine, its more about respecting the process
things have been rough but ya know. im alive
yeah. Honestly im super anxious and overwhelmed but i still feel more calm than i have in the last like 2 years
almost like i removed the problem from my life LMAO
oh def. this is a different type of anxiety for sure. but i still feel so much freer and my skin in clearing up so i mean chemical reaction
i did live with mark for a period of time a few years ago
yeah. ive been trying to get him to let me do a haircutting stream with him but he never wants to
yeah. he lets it go long and then gets like a skin fade then lets it grow out again
and i just never get my hair done. like the last time i got it colored was in october
well, you can look at the like 3 inches of regrowth ontop of my green and its pretty long
its been on the back burner lol. but im hoping within the next few weeks i can get back into it
ive actually started playing the resident evil games. my friend game shared all his games with me and theyre his favorite and so im just playing through some of them
yeah we're gonna get in a vc tonight while i try to beat res 2
yeah. i watched the gameplay for 0 and 1 and was not interested until the are remade (which should be within the next year or so)
all i could think of while watching was "THE TIME LOSS"
im already bad at aiming can we be nicer with the camera
I think it was too far on the right side
sometimes you cant reach cuz this games weird if its in a specific spot on the pillar
apparently I should bitch more often about how bad I am
fucking up numerous random shit lol
I tried to learn this but I dont understand how it works
every time I do the jump attack he just slides off and I dont get to keep spamming it
maybe thats what im doing wrong
yoo I did the faron bomb boost
that was easier than I thought
the b button thing was the issue
Rain and I cleaned up the room some...how's the run?
Yeah two different words and urgency
Gohma dodging when she doesn't need to
Wait is it the male or female spiders that lay eggs...
Don't laugh lolz male seahorses have babies xD
alright ima start my next one when you go
yeah I just post myn in extention
cuz they dont have an ams channel
I was told every zelda game... Link is unreliable because he was sleeping lolz
where is the key you grab
I might start doing that one cuz bomb boost sometimes just sucks
Why did I hear "beat her board"
You said faster lolz and I said and more accurate lolz
I was staring at the movements wtf
Nah he doesn't like throwing it because of this reason lolz
Oh hey I've been dying to try one of thes... Hey, where's my reset? My reset?? MY DIET DR. BiT?
I forgot that was a thing...the events
This is how m2k felt lolz
Yeah...especially when you're use to trying to adjust because of the last controller
I gtg... phanto274GL with the no reset run and a very known phanto274GG
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
im always the first one here
ok then the pape max rando
we need fresh rando blood then
wasnt that during the covid period? live should be more fun
you math that? i just follow the shell
Welcome back to your personal hell
reverse all cards is a great one
What was your main in this again? All bosses?
Is it Wii VC that has an alternate method?
So just play on Wii VC EZ
I even have wii vc and I decided not to
Wait that was 3 years ago?
A failed any% attempt if you will
maybe pape is better on rrlat
i mean its better entertainment then a 100% nier automata run where 18 hours is friggin fishing
night slots aee usually for rpgs and long games yeah
you could also try for esa. it has 2 strims
no i mean. normally its filled with longer games like a final fantasy or an rpg
I always loved watching paper mario runs for the glitches
i bet you ff7 will get a slot in sgdq or agdq this year with the new glitches
i heard the new skip is crazy
ff10 is cool but its just too long. same for ff9 and ff8
FF12 TZA has x4 speedup for movement which is cool. makes the run a lot shorter
csr i dont like. it in my opinion makes the run less fun
imagine if you had a csr for mario galaxy. saves 8 hours on 242 stars
I think most modern games do
kingdom hearts did it well. it became a skill
yeah. I wanted to get into speed running Borderlands 2, but you have to downpatch to a specific version and that's a pain
they specifically patched speedrun glitches that made the run cool so everyone runs on an old version
oh the item duping that got patched and then even more broken
its great if devs come on speedrun events to witness how broken their stuff is and it blows their minds
dread is also very broken lol
I always appreciate developers that do that
if a glitch doesn't affect the casual playthrough, there's no point patching it
it probably impacting the casual gamer
im not sure what it is with ttyd but i feel it didnt age well
its a good game but some things are just slowpaced
i mean why do you have to do like 30 fights in an arena
I was playing the remake and got to the final chapter and was like "I don't want to play this"
is 7 the one with the pigs?
i think the funnest chapter is the train
true its all dialogue but its done quite well
as a casual right. as a speedrun its boooooooring
but to be fair id rather speedrun the train then the friggin glitz pit
im not sure how monado ever copes running glitzpit. gee i got bad rng rip 5 mins
this is still the better of the pape games
after they let go of the rpg element it went downhill
its nothing techy about it like sm64
isnt it weird. smb is a better platformer
shouldnt have started the pikmin 216 subset btw 😅
the set of that hack has a pay of debt and all treasures speedrun as part of the set
and its within half an hour of videos you an find, sooo fuuun 🙃
I just noticed, there a no enemies here when Jr. is there?
oh, and hi gl hf, btw
I ... don't think rando does that. I'll have to check
Oh, I can take a look
The ID shifting is so dumb, I regularly forget updating the generator and then suddenly some random partner is no longer considered progression
Annoyingly, how the item type system was implemented requires items of the same time to be clumped together in the IDs. And the partners have to be last
We do have the IDs listed in the generator's docs folder. But I forgot to update that for the latest release
I may set up a PR for the next version since IDs will shift yet again (yay..)
Well I do get it. If you're used to AP autotracking stuff, and a rando update breaks all tracking ...
heck, even I am annoyed with it
I think that's not AP generally, but the pape implementation. But yeah, bleh
im sure ill go bnack to the green
but ive gotten a lot of complements on the blonde
and a lot of my hairstylist friends (and one of my teachers) told me it works well with my skin tone so im having an idenity crsis
i did have split dye at one point
all i did when i got my hair done this time was move up the highlights and tone out the green. so im like an ICY platinum blonde
that solved that mental dilema for you didnt it
3 years of me giving you passive income
just say glenn sent you and theyll art for you
trusty keeps refusing my money its unfair
i had a lil drawing that i had her rush in like two days and she goes "oh its a bday present" like durl no
i bought her REPO as payment i guess
and i need to commission two emotes from her
I don't have any other slightly pikmin related emotes
I know rock pikmin dont exist in pikmin 2 but rockmin tippiTap
definitely got some meanie ones in the set, needs 2 playthroughs if you dont know the game in and out tippiTap but nothing you cant do easily
I can get a new CPU, Mobo, and RAM for $550
what cpu combo deal is that
mhhhh I'd rather the 9800x3d personally
I wanted the 9950X, but that one is $750
And I'm like... as nice as having 4 extra cores...
@Jonxhas This is a home server. X3D is a waste
But the extra 4 cores would have been nice... but not $200 nice
its something to do with how citra recompiles
its egregiously bad in hatsune miku project mirai DX, the game runs but its unplayable in emulator because the game itself is tied to framerate
the explanation of all the pikpik carrots being eaten does kind of trigger my adhd focus
is it bad i never played this game before?
this game is closest to pikmin 4
2 > 4 > 1 > 3 for me tippiTap
mostly cus pikmin 2 is just sooo much fun
sorry, my pikmin 2 funzone brain is gettin tickled big time rn tippiGiggle
this game is crazy because in the piklopedia louie writes instructions on how to cook all of the monsters
can't wait for the pickle jar lid
still kinda sad how the Wii version onwards said no to this
god this game is so immersive
but then kept other things in
i remember being a kid and being like OMG that was at the store!!!
also like - with all the trash for me when growing up, made me think more about not throwing shit away willy nilly, think about mow mmuch trash ya produce and such
i forget how you unlock louies notes
louie notes is once you eiher a) paid off the debt or b) get all treasures
you can turn the camera btw by pressing L to center it behind you tippiTap
damn it pulled it but too late
whats RA ? r u doing 100% of the game ?
The only way to master this one is to not play it
That was my nickname in college
Ah yes, you get the pikmin limit increase now
The Pikmin yearn for the flower
"clear the cave without losing any pikmin" > loses 1 pikmin
this is like a I accidentally left my game on to go get pizza
Oh I never knew they did that, that's neat!
its in animal crossing too but i forget where
good, finally got a pb in restricted BiT
barely missed sub 3 hour though so definitely going for that
but yeah pikmin 2 is a fun game
saorik2Tifa the onion just needs tifa from the italian senate
was lurking, laid in bed a majority of the day cuz neck was VERY sore
i played the Wii version of Pikmin 2 so i guess that irony didn't apply to me
i think you should reset yeah
idk that it saves every floor
doesn't have rewind like the remaster
it does auto save every floo
i mean tbf who would actually want an empress bulblax carcass? LUL
didn't you know theyr'e easily convertible into sleeping bags
i was so many days into this game that the boss was just absolutely depressed and had nothing new to say he was just like FML
"day 111 of not paying off our debt... i am completely lost all hope and im losing weight and my wife left me"
"can you just please do your job"
got myself an airfrier yesterday btw - things awesome tippiTap
when holding a pikmin in hand, Dpad left / right to cycle through the colors tippiTap
i really want an air fryer
i don't cook but i want one
I got mine 50% off for 40 bucks rather then 80 tippiTap
and gotta say: while the fries (which were also on sale for like 1.50 per kilo) are not up to snuff w belgium fries cus the people there make godlike fries imo
i can't eat potato anymore but id like to try air fried fish or chicken just no breading
I can only imagine it going real well
maybe even wrap it in foil
long enough or with enough turnin yea
foil wrapping I dont know, ya could do that though I reckon - an airfrier basically is a very compact oven
the foil would be to prevent the outside from burning before the middle cooks
also if ya need to have some oil on it, sparingly - the one I got doesnt like lots of that, if at all v sprayed on oil o like very thin layers
the benefit for me would be not having to use oil
just saying that if you got something which would still need it somewhat, you can reduce it LOTS
i can only really eat olive oil because im allergic to peanut, sunflower and grapeseed
i just hate not being able to eat fast food
I am thinkin of tryin frozen pizza, cut into pieces then stacked in the air frier PrideLaugh
eh - ofc I'd first let it defrost a bit
but like - I cant see it not being able to do that
but also like - that just means I gotta pay attention a smidge, keep an eye on whats going on and such
like - the big plus I give an airfrier rn: its compact, doesnt need heavy duty power cables or other big install costs
and it does well for imo up to 3 people if you take care of time well
plus like - for one or 2 ppl, its more then enough for normal food. if its for specifically baking a big cake, obv. tha wont hold up
totally not related to me being happy
THE tool to break pikmin 2 KEKW
not even to pass time rly
meant to be used if you are done at a direction to bring yourself back to base
so you'd keep like 2 pikmin, napsack, they'd carry ya back
which in turn if used in silly ways enables lots of jank
So with swarming (c stick) especially with only a couple Pikmin they will only target things you're basically directly touching
They will basically form a straight line. It's for navigation and not really targeting
With things like gates, walking up to them is fine and easier if you want to crowd quickly. Otherwise just throw them
wait, were those the purples you left by the ship at the base
im missing part of your head
is this the hardest rando possible?
Heya, gl hf! Are you on a rando break break right now?
Everything is on?? That's not good for the electricity bill
No hammers to now 2 hammers Sadge
Holy flag poles it’s a Phantom stream
i did this yesterday and forgot i didn't have parakarry, laki or ultra to get around the last wall LUL
a letter? i hope its a cool letter like the Q
The music and sound effects in this game are unmatched fr pepeJAM
I had burritos last night lol
I was about to ask for the invite but chicken tacos are beta NOPERS
didnt equip attack fx c. sadge
Love how the plushies are laid out today phanto274Smile
have you turned off full heals?
looking at old bot quotes and found... Phaotmgamesbot: Thhe audio is slighty desynced. Not sure if it doesnt matter for progression, but imagine having to do Kappa
i need a randomize pipe destinations option
thats why its low impact and still fun
I've lost all my duels today :(
Yes made it and what a wecloming
Meanwhile I just got my deck boxes
I just need to finish building my decks
Meanwhile I play master duel and mald
I lost the duel which means I lost my soul
That's not even Canon zeli, they translated die to losing their soul
It is canonical for the seal of orichalcos @swiftpichu_
Genuinely doesn't exist in the manga
Correct. Not a cannon. A seal
That's why it's called Seal and not Cannon of Orichalcos
It's so funny how unused the Orichalcos is in the modern game
Oh beautiful my screen froze in an ad
Orichcalcos is absolutely atrocious to play, same for the legendary knights
Only notable card is the retrain of that one card for blue eyes
And the card also says you forfeit your soul and therefore it IS canon to the tcg
@rgamer0 Because most decks need an extra deck to survive, and those who don't probably have a better archetype-based field spell
Or both, high kings for example
The best thing that Timaeus got was the retrain to make it work better for DM decks but it has problems still
The timaeus that's basically amulet dragon? KEKW
No I'm talking about Timaeus the dragon
As long as you run full dm you're fine, but the con is that you're running full dm
Even eye of timaeus sucks in DM
That reprint looks like amulet dragon gamer
Why would you need to search for it?
DM really needs some new support
Red-Eyes and Blue Eyes have way surpassed it
I summon Mommy, I mean Guardian Eatos
Oh that was a good joke
Because it kinda counts for both in that specific instance
It's more metalmorph support but it's decent red eyes support
Crystal king is 3rd on my faves
The new Red Eyes Metal Claw Dragon in the next set
Eh metalmorph and red eyes have always been correlated
The new blue eyes stuff is pretty decent though
The important thing is to just draw the out
I consider right now that DM is mostly relegated to Shining Sarco as of this moment
Which has starters out the wazoo
And why play shining sarc when you play millennium
And will be getting even more searchers in the next set
I mean in terms of DM
And I mean in terms of YuGiOh
I know that Millenium will be getting a new Gaia
That messes up synchro and XYZ plays
How come the new Gaia is millennium and not sarc?
How do you like it when all your monsters opposing Gaia have +6 to their levels
It's because it's a Grandpa card
Oh right gaia is from grandpa
DM is mostly just gone to Yugi at this point
And Yugi's deck is Shining Sarco
New DMG helps out shining sarco a ton by being another searcher
Makes me wonder when there's gonna be a new curse of dragon reprint
As well as a way to start plays
Oh no... Not my xyz plays... Anyway, link the circuit
Retrain CoD, Buster Blader and Magnet Warriors for Sarco pls
I feel buster blader himself is fine as is, but his pet needs a reprint
Funny that one of the current meta decks is a XYZ deck that relies heavily on Rnk4.spam
Again my current decks are Shining Sarco, Sky Striker and Maliss
When I read rank 4 I can only think of utopia
2 of my decks are link spam
They're the current top deck too
I'm dm, blue eyes and sky strikers
Shining Sarco is harder to build but next set will help them out a ton besides the new probably censored DMG
Bystials are finding spots to use as disruption
Magnet Trio. Level 4. ATK 1400 DEF 1000. If this card is normal or special summoned, add 1 "Shining Sarc" or a monster that mentions it from your deck to your hand. If this card on the field is destroyed by battle or by card effect, you can set one 1 "Magnet" trap from your deck. You may only use each effect of Magnet Trio once per turn.
And Bystial Maliss is the most popular use for them right now
I know it's old in tcg but it's new enough in MD
Since right now the top decks are light/dark
Enough that some people are asking for limits on Bystials because they're oppressing the current dark meta
what if i just want to active  runick fountain
What's the last BLS as of late? It's super soldier right?
@blacktiger51 you go fuck yourself because you're getting that shit negated
I feel likes BLS should get something in a bit
Right now DM needs more support
Red eyes and Blue eyes have enough for now
@SwiftPichu_ well shit summon  hugin add runick fountain active it AngyTwink
Blue eyes is the same that just released in MD right?
Only red eyes cards I would want in the future is a crossover with it and Flame Swordsman
Since right now the only thing that unifies Joey.dek is metalmorph
Maxx C is illegal in the TCG
Remember MD is a different format altogether
Go get copies of Fuwaloss that are like currently 100 bucks for a single copy
@Rgamer0 its allowed in master dual  ACTINUP
And I worry that Fuwaloss will be a short print in the next set
Tcg, ocg and MD are all different formats
Wouldn't surprise me gamer, it's why droplet is as expensive
Since it's one of the cards announced for Quarter Century Stampede
@blacktiger51 chain salamangreat charge, targeting ash, miragestallio, and gazelle.
I'm going to get a box of it mostly to try for alt art Raye
I'll probably get that for my birthday
I liked it more than raye personally
The alt art Shizuku since we're likely seeing that in the promotional anime for Sky Strikers
Since Linkage implies that she's going into Shizuku
Is there even a date for when they're releasing it?
Next month is when the first episodes will start
Meanwhile in Japan the current Rush duel anime will end for a GX remaster
@Zeliversal well shit you got me
So no new Yu-Gi-Oh Anime for a while
Better that way, I didn't like the rush series
Arc V was decent but rushed
But after that shit got fucked
That reminds me I should probably try to update my pend deck
I loved Arc-V before the anniversary shenanigans screwed it
@Zeliversal i had to look up charge i didn't know what that 1 card did KEKW
Ok. So judgement is negated. Charge resolves. I return miragestallio and ash, summon gazelle, called by resolves without effect as no target, ash negates Maxx c, circle resolves adding jack jaguar. But the IMPORTANT thing is that your runick fountain resolves YEP
Small Melodious engine to lead into the ZARC stuff
I forgot the new zarc exists
And that it's just that much easier to summon
2 Bacha are basically so easy to make to start into the ZARC stuff
Zarc is already super easy to summon. You just need 5 very specific cards in your hand.
It more or less is getting into the pend magician things using the melodious engine
how much i miss my runick spright deck in master dual its got hit a long ass time ago Madge
Since that was my GX era stuff
Cause it's not banned anymore surprisingly
lightsworn and dark world are my 2 fav old decks
@SwiftPichu_ 1 of the spell card is still at 1 irrc
runnable as in mid af YEP
You sure were excited to reach that door
Yeah shut the F8UCk up bot
Shooting star spam on the table
Welp, you got no power so might as well use all those shooting stars
Maybe he'll feel bad for you and give you a discount if you keep trading coins with him
surely that is how it works
Nah what we need is more shooting stars
this is gonna cost you 100 coins for breaking one, how could u
Are you gonna eat that? You went to the trouble of scrambling it
@blacktiger51 You should hop in MD NODDERS
@Zeliversal i haven't played for like 6 months
Time for a break from your break
Sooo Sushie Glitch into Tubba's for Train...yeah that checks
At least your done SNIFFA ing out stuff
rando is rando? who woulda thunk it!
Sometimes may be good, sometimes may be shit
(even tho I wasn't actually first lmao)
gl with the run or runs PrideFlower
pikmin 216 is kickin my butt tippiGiggle
When do you think you'll run more All Bosses?
rain told me he wasn't trying to beat the new no ace run cause he sucks at clippy too much
the funny thing is he's like 40s ahead of the new record early on and then loses so much
this just me rn or is twitch fuckin up for other ppl as well?
fuckin up how? is fine here
I'm always having issues on mobile
then a minute later, it reloads the stream - a different stream meanwhile no issues as far as I can tell
so ye olde "cant even try to debug cus its something fucky"
next best error code is error 3000 KEKW
those are the only 2 error codes i've ever seen
i wonder if it has to do with that FFZ bug i saw about
there was some new twitch experiment that broke FFZ and they tried to submit the new version and firefox did a dumb and rejected it or something
so if you run into that you gotta uninstall it and reinstall
i always struggled to get tampermonkey stuff to work idk if i'm just stupid or what
like people say to just copy paste this thing and then i do and it doesn't work lol
i was also getting error 2000 so i just cleared browser cache and signed back in to everything lol
yea i haven't been on here much either cause i only got home a few hours ago
Basing my assumption on the fact the first thing I heard upon joining the stream was "fuck man" I'll guess the run is going great
the last "new" game I played was Kirby forgor and before that was uhhhhhh
My switch has always been a dust collector
I played some random stuff on xbox game pass that might be newer? no idea lmao
I sold mine like a month ago
my brother moved out last year and he came here a month or so ago and took the switch
I only played like 4-5 games on the switch. tiny bit of origami king, bowser's fury, kirby, smash. that might be it lmao
i barely got anywhere in it. was not having a good time at all
I think you'll save a few seconds
I like how all the modern paper mario games, i've played less and less of them
I enjoyed Color Splash outside of it being way too easy and the boss fights being either literally impossible or completely trivial if you have the necessary item (which ig goes back to it being way too easy).
Finally almost built my sky striker deck, just needs one more Linkage and the main deck staples
Dragons as in Dragon Rulers, Blue Eyes or Dragonmaids?
Blue Eyes just buy 3x of the new Blue Eyes structure deck
back in highschool someone used a red eyes deck
Red Eyes is all over the place
Though now with the new Metalmorph support Red Eyes has some ability to function now
And red eyes gains a new metalmorph starter
It's the best version of the deck right now
the red eyes cards they did for Rush Duel or whatever it's called in japan look so fucking cool
Seems that Red Eyes is leaning towards the metalmorph stuff what with darkness metal dragon and now full metal dragon
After all metalmorph seems to be entirely Joey now
What with the latest metalmorph monster being a Flame Swordsman
So metalmorph is looking more to be modernjoey.dek
Has both red eyes and flame swordsman and even copycat
GX is getting a remaster anime soon after Go Rush ends in Japan
I doubt any modern cards for GX archetypes will be in the remaster
Since HERO and Yubel and Ancient Gears and Crystal Beasts and Arcana Force all got newish support
Supreme King Jaden pulls out his new ace Evil HERO Neos Lord
Gravekeeper got a bunch of fusions a while ago
Though with individual decks Marik has a bunch of Ra support, the less said about Ishizu the better because her cards helped to define the definitive tier zero deck and Odion also got new support recently
Like Odion now actually has a deck to play
Not just Apophis and Mystical beast serket and Temple of the kings anymore
Apophis are his trap monsters and he now has 3 of them
He now has a bunch of fusions too
and Anubis as a pseudo boss
Anubis also has a bunch of traps as well
He also has a card of himself in his own deck
Red Eyes Metal Claw Dragon also does the iconic Joey pose
Ok. Mr. Phantom. I discovered secret option #3 in my CPU decision
So the previous options were: CPU + Mobo + 32GB of RAM. 12-core 5.6Ghz for $550. 16-core 5.7GHz for $750
Secret option #3 I discovered... Spend $1100. Get two of the 12 core bundles. Now I have 24 cores total, and redundant systems
2 CPUs, 2 mobos, 2 kits of 32GB ram
Like, that way I can get both the benefit of the extra cores, some fault-tolerance on the important services, and it's still a good deal compared to the 16-core CPU
what curse have u flung my way Phantom
Livesplit just opened when your run died
it's called 'hammering the shit outta silver'
I have a vision, just need to execute
I'll send a pic in DMs since you're in prologue hell
the bush is shaped like this \_/
so it can go around below mario
yo pidge ty for the gl
ty for the good luck lopez
manual hammering of metal often leaves uneven edges sadly
what are you poweiring it with now
i mean like it's own brick or just plugged into something else
yo I come back to kitty! <3
Hello everyone. just got off work. hope everyones day is going well
it's an easy trip for me :D
we have to go back in a few weeks for mom's follow up
but yeah Boston is a labyrinth
he's too busy bein starstruck by his idol
I was so close to a 21:59 once but I threw
just need lucky coins and to not mess up
I just hit a fat pb
my 2 monitors have been mounted finally have space on my desk
domino's have stuffed crust pizza now been dying to try it
@blacktiger51 I believe you mean "will die if I try it" 4Head
Thanks Phantom. That made my night
I know how I can build you a shortcut
honestly, setting everything on fire would be better since paper burns fast
it would be a short story
But you have 3 hours to go
awh wasn't in spot number 3 3:
Yo goodluck Phantom! Controller still giving you issues today despite removing the input display?
that sounds easy to time SMILERS
Oh no why? Cause card lzs?
I'm sad so many of the fast tricks are LZS. It's defintiely not an approacahble trick to learn
And I agree, seems very loopeholey the way the definition is right now
That really isn't as bad as you'd think
I just wish the push wasn't so tedious even if it does eventually work
12 is good to know, I need to practice that a bit
How did u celebrate St Paddys day weekend?
yo amish ty for the gl
yo Lopez ty for the gl
Alright, who's going to discover a trick easier than BHS that makes it obsolete so I can never feel obligated to learn the quick way
should it be? since it beats the game?
I dunno, glundo gives a similar vibe to 5 golden liloinks
are there any games you run with a perfect leaderboard in your opinion
Is there like a max sword upgrades category?
dismount with b and just hold it EZ
Okay there, I've watched your minish cap runs lol
i don't like the star pieces at all
i do think 96 star piece is cool but the rest i have no problem with existing for the most part i think
but that doesn't mean i don't think they're dumb
some of these should get migrated back to a spreadsheet ngl
ah yes, a category that's entirely rng
nah doesnt have to be empty
that's when the retime would start yeah
not quite but it's pretty insane
Sounds like your next speedrun Phantom phanto274Smile
i think there were 9 non golds
i'm just gonna have to say goodbye to my pb
because twitch didn't save my 2 highlights of it
cause my stream cut out 2 and a half hours in
and mods approved it when i asked
the day i hook up my n64
or i start playing bomberman64 instead lol
@Iceblue uggghh fiiiine. i'll start the apocalypse
i didn't want to have to do this ya know
yeah the only reason i'll hook my n64 right now is to start learning BM64
Is this game a childhood classic?
I mean this game is over 25 years old now at this point right?
Damn it how did I get to be the youngin in the room
I remember this part, the 2 guards were talking about Tubba Blubba's weakness
you mean you don't speak fluent japanese after playing this game?
I woulda been 3 in 2001 lol
I was 6 and it was the first game I ever beat SMILERS
This dang bird shows up TWICE
wait what was the first thing you said?
I also basically only played Sony consoles as a kid so I always think of N64/PS1 era being only 90s and I forget that the N64 bled into the early 2000s a bit.
If it makes you feel better Ice I'm an old 29
Cause PS2 was 2000 but GC wasn't till 01
have they try buying a new tv Kappa
Look slike bootler really doesnt want anyone to enter the forest :O
i wish i could get wall mounted
Were gonna see Lady Bow soon! :)
and of course the model is on the back and a tv that big the mount isn't extending Clueless
@Phantom5800 Who's your favorite partner? :)
what's the rng on how many throws?
There's no arguing with Lady Bow, she gets what she wants
Lady Bow is lucky she doesnt have to get all sweaty when she's in the desert!
RUN FOR IT, ITS TUBBA BLUBBA :O
IDK. I prefer the desert cold
As much as it like physically hurt being there in the summer I would take it over minnesota summers lol
always over 100 dry is way nicer than 90-100 humid
Ok I hereby order deserts to be lukewarm
@Zeliversal If you had a machine that can control weather that is!
@adventureruler1 I don't need science. I have my declarations
Tubba's house is huge but it makes sense cause he's big too, so to him its normal size
shoulda waited for half a second so it woulda been 3:44:43 which is a palindrome at least
So those guys walking around the weapons are like Tubba Blubba's relatives or something? Cause Tubba doesnt seem like a king or ruler of any kind
I mean he owns a castle so he's gotta be somewhat important
Hmmm maybe he built it himself or he works and paid for construction workers!
Well we know one thing, Tubba is not very smart, he just destroyed a part of his own house
What's a little quick escape between friends
But Tubba is strong so hes gonna get through that door no problem
Those goombas need some fresh air they been in those tunnels for too long they turned green
they need to stay off the weed(uh) too
I didnt get to see streamer beat up Tubba Blubba :(
Oh haha i thought maybe you used an item or a partner ability
Where would you rather live? Tubba Blubba's mansion or Lady Bow's mansion?
Oh godddd not this annoying little brat again >:(
I thought you really lost! haha
Would Star Storm instead of a jump have saved you or do you need it next?
Hey streamer did you read my question about the mansions?
You have to choose 1 come onnnnnnnnn
I would choose Tubba Blubba because i dont want to live in a creepy forest :O
I would think Tubba Blubba eats alot so he has to poop somewhere
or kitchens even I don't think
Well he has a bedroom thats for sure, so he should have a kitchen and bathroom SOMEWHERE
I'm not buyin a 1 bed, 0 bath, 0 kitchen mansion lmao.
Even if its only 100 bucks?????????
Remember man you could always get those things installed later!
Now could you live in a desert tho? You might have to take into account what you'll eat
You should like speedrun mario 1 while this cutscene plays
or any game that takes less than 5 min to beat
Whats surprising is that out of all the characters in the Mario games that could've helped him get proper rest... IS THE GOOMBAS!?
How many gdq options will there be
surely this time glitchless will be in
Here he comes, the brat that never knows when to stop
i would honestly be down to derust and be a part of it
how would you relay it? every 2 chapters? or 1 chapter each and just cycle twice?
i think it'd be a given that lopez just does ch7 and 8 cuz of the mashing if we do spook
yeah i could do those, would have to practice them
she went to north desert looking for moustafos, I was there to help
and backing those up doesn't feel as bad as the clubbas
powerr bomb is the new fren LUL
I wouldn't mind doing the beginning if no one else wants to
im having a good time, i played 5 hours and then now theres spikey POISON boys, so i thought that was a good place to call it lmao
but I figured I'd take the end probably
if it doesn't get in we should just do it anyway with whoever is there
and idk maybe it would be more hype switching every chapter
yeah i said when we hit the second chapter title card i was like, damn, that took me six hours. Im pretty sure phantom would've beaten the game by now LMAO
3 is longer than 2 by a bit
9 person relay, just get a random member of the audience to do prologue, then 1 person does each chapter :P
oh phantom, im getting new dinning room table set today. My sister's work sold their model home so all the furniture must go
yeah i dont think audience participation would fly lmao
we would have to put the estimate to 6hrs cuz of just bowser alone
table and 4 chairs, barely used for $350
and its in a model so you know its nice
not a problem for spook COPIUM
they should let you airlift bosses after a certain amount of dmg dealt tbh
bro cant even pluck a flower
The Koopa Bros thought they were slick too
this is very interesting to watch now that I've played through this part, I'm pretty sure it took me an hour and a half to get there
and you already know where to go
Why wouldn’t Kooper be wearing a shirt? KEKW
Oh I didn’t know the plot LUL
These little pests are pretty good at this
Whoa! Twilight Princess! I love Zelda! <3
I wasn’t paying attention I thought you were doing another rando lmao
i also really need to practice tp, but i have no idea what current settings everyone is practicing rn and also how 1.3 development is going
i want entrance rando already dangit
I also added some emotes for peaches like AngyTwink MarioDumpy PeachO NotTheRun
also yes AngyTwink is adorable i love them
That’s scary precise for such a long run damn
Just steal it from road NODDERS
Mario was too poor to continue
It'd be funny if there was a canon bad ending for every single way a run could end lol.
so just action replay 50 attack to Mario and boom you win easy in 4 minutes.
I like that the last split is "Hold b for siz minutes"
oh you can kill him tho? lmao.
is it quicker to not defend?
I know what it is LUL
oh yeah I forgot that was a thing
also cant block until we meet twink
yes lol, i did fight goomba king, i assumed it was mandatory?
no he's talkin bout the pro strats
i got no  idea what the strats are to tell yet lol we shall see
why didnt you tell ME about this axl???
i wasnt there for your first stream lmao
yeah you were, idk how long but you was there pretty -
home DEPOT is on DOOR DASH?
What about IKEA is that on there too?
good greif, i thought my delivery service was odd enough hacing gas stations lmao
I can do 7/11, but i mean like, actual gas stations
was slicing limes at work, now I've this craving for tacos
That crash site is going to need ALOT of worker toads to fix
your tacos were the final blow, definitely thought of 'em while craving Mexican cuisine
but what if you die how are you supposed to continue your progress!?
i used to work at dominos and as a result i can never eat it again
then all your runs are you sum of bests
"How can Phantom avoid getting soft locked economically?" Ah, the dreaded economic soft lock. It’s like being stuck in a loop of poor decisions and dwindling resources. Here’s a thought: maybe try not spending all your coins on things like overpriced fright jars and life shrooms. Invest in something more solid, like a speedy spin. And perhaps steer clear of shady salesmen offering "great deals". You know the guy or, you know, just reload a previous save file of life choices. Cheer100
I could splice a mid 3:37
yeah just with my sum of best
i probably will i'm just lazy lol
always blamin it on the cartridge, just rng manipulate better, duh.
if you were just good and got to that room 5 seconds earlier, you coulda gotten the key before the koopa dropped the gate NotLikeThis
The greatest character in the entire universe defeated by a flight of stairs.
you can kill prologue bowser like we talked about :P
it'd be funny if killing him warped you to chapter 8 hallway bowser.
@LordLevias19 Thanks for the gift sub!
oh you can't use hammer even tho you have it
I just showed up and see crash screen what happened
no glitches in logic wha is this
fair do you just not feel like thinking about glitches
did you at least change it to minimal cutscenes from shortened because didn't S1 have shortened
I think they updated the preset yeah
sister texted me, she'll be here in 20 minutes. I responded with POGGIES. She went to google it LUL
i am return i was forced to run an errand
i see we gave up on that tun too lmao
sub 5 go mode lfg :P
but yeah parents needed me to run to the pharmacy so i got myself a sweet treat while i was ther
youre just not having a good pape day clearly
there's a 3 musketeers anime wtf???
theres a sherlock anime for crying outloud
Is that the number of times chatting and not being first?
There's no total streams watched data?
twitch has it, it shows in your monthly recap if you sub
so this guy took me forever ti find
i misread trhat he was in the city and i was runnin garound in the desert in all the top areas because he said "keep going up" and i kinda skipped the rest
axl had to tell me he was in the city, i got the rest lmao
uhh i got the music note, and kinda got lost for a bit
what happens if you say youre mario to that guy
i said luigi on instinct but i am curious
... that would've been incredibly funny why did i not do that
lazy ass Boo, throwing the weight outside the mansion
"Want this dusty cake I found in a haunted mansion?" YES
literally just bought eggs, $9 for 24
this is not a joke, in the last few weeks the most confiscated item at the us/can border is americans trying to bring in eggs from canada
as eggs are literally now cheaper to buy in the cursed canadian currency
and also we have alot of them
aparently y'all are low on eggs and are now asking germany for eggs??? i Guess??
@peachedpocky I can believe that. It's what we do with insulin, go to our neighbors who charge reasonable prices for that shit
eggs are simple but have a lot of flexibility and utility, so they're busted
I never have eggs by themselves really but there's a lot of things I eat that use eggs as an ingredient.
I mostly use 'em for breakfast sandwiches and omelets
a cobb salad sounds good rn ur right
but also if im going through the effort to hard boil eggs im making cream eggs on toast
I have this tiny skillet, literally for frying eggs.
@buff00n i find those funny bcuz like, how small is your burner that you can get away with that
@peachedpocky burner's average, but setting it to 1 / 2 out 6 is more than enough flame to cook in the thing
@buff00n ah, a gas stove, that answers it then. I have a coil stove. There is no smaller lamo
Had a coil stove in an apartment and I hated that bloody thing
did you just do a weird clip into that wall?
That pinned message sounds like GamesBot's gonna cook some frog legs, or something
oh come back to a rando
well if that idea of a 9 person relay goes through i know what chapters you wont be signing up for lmao
yeah i don't blame you ch1 sucks for a speed run
"Who wants to run a Pape Relay?" *raises hands*
oh hes just there in spirit
I am here with a fuck yeah salad to bless the rando
sometimes u just gotta stuff a buncha greens in ur face (not St Patrick's Day)
what was it? I was busy with my salad
oh we got kooper? was putting ice cream back in freezer lmao
everyone's got the need for monch
oh not all chapters scaled to 8?
that shooting star item is very handy lmao
YES HE IS REAL AND CAN HURT YOU
Peaches, elec attacking and explosion will instantly knock down the tower
yeah for me by that part of the fight i had already used all my fp lmao
S0 was the only preset with it open iirc
I wonder how much chap 1 scaled amayzees would give
rich in honey dipped shrooms fatpidTHONK
That thing Lakilster threw is really good!!! :O
" Fuck those Yoshi kids " - Phantom
The Yoshi kids getting in to trouble once again huh?
@adventureruler1 if they got themselves in, they can get themselves out
Power of salad 🤝 power of weed
@buff00n BUT THERE JUST CHILDREN :(
( S I G H )
fast food does not go into the fridge
oooo those spike tops look fantastic
I cannot throw stones, my younger brother has thrown McDonald's straight into the fridge, without even eating any of the food
is multibonk fixed in rando or is it trash still? Or both :P
he's also done that with microwave popcorn
@buff00n STRAIGHT TO JAIL FOR YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER
I legit opened the fridge to find a fully popped, unopened bag of microwave popcorn
was it like, butter??? was it planned for toppings or st??
cause if it was butter? STRAIGHT TO JAIL DO NOT PASS GO
w. why would you pop it if you weren't going to eat it immediately
@trustyaltruist I don't bloody know, so I couldn't tell you
I can see popping popcorn for like a candy coating but like
this chat has now become r/peoplegettingreallymadatfood
but like. microwave popcorn just goes stale quickly. you have to pop right before eating
why would you pop if you weren't gonna eat it is my question
I guess it also kinda is me cause I have Food Issues :X
maybe you changed your mind mid pop? idfk
I would use an ice item against him cause he's a fire type enemy
also also, he's thrown empty plates / cups into the fridge
listen if I get soapmouth or Bad Texture midway through eating I power through that shit
I'm just assured your lil bro definitely was high in these instances
fwiw, I'm like 13 years older than him
That's about the average age gap between me and my own brothers
@FatPidgeyBirb as far as I know, he doesn't. He is on the spectrum, tho
omg Kolorado walking off sadly mid-way
@buff00n I'm on the spectrum myself (points to previous food related issues) but like. SQUINTS
Phantom softlocked their room and trapped parakarry in it
can't come into work today, I'm softlocked int my room
that actually happened to me today
got trapped in today from snow
I'd like it to be april already
damn, no food or nothing ?
@FatPidgeyBirb I too, would like to see the Switch 2 Direct
I just am sick of fake spring I would like Real Spring
it was like 65 degrees in my area, more fake spring, please
so I can have regular depression instead of seasonal depression
it's been 50 and rainy and I'm waiting for when we get sucked back to the 20s
The dog didn't deserve that!! You monster!!
I'm telling Chucky and his eevee siblings
yeah, my cat does that on occasion
it one of the few times I've seen the bastard actually drink water
Not so ominous now huh TutanKoopa? >:)
do you have  a fountain bowl for your cat then, buff00n
Does ur cat also enjoy drinking from running faucets?
@FatPidgeyBirb I have not tested this
📝 if ur cat enjoys running faucet water, I'd consider the fountain bowl
Antiguy is not really a bad guy
@FatPidgeyBirb We had to get our orange tabby a faucet shaped fountain because he refuses to drink of anything else
orange cats have a single braincell dedicated to food, attention or murder
only one of those at a given time
from my orange tabby experiences they definitely behave differently from other cats and I'm not sure why
@SeventyFourTG the running witch joke answer is that it's a soul on its first life so it has no idea what it is doing
when the ice fishing goes wrong
How else are they supposed to get their drinking water?
from a faucet like a civilized penguin
I like the song of the snowy mountains
is it just me or do gulp its remind you of quagsires
A comfy bed near a fireplace <3 Just amazing!
Well now you don't have to go to 3!
if ya want it chat, all ya gotta do is guess correctly
sure, I'll toss a casual 10k in
with that prediction I'm down to 66.6 points so I need this prediction to be wrong
Healthy pot this time around, who will win it all?
I had 155k then I spent 25k
Wow, yeah I have half that
I'd have less if I could make u play Celeste 😏
I might have spent more and/or actively watched less
I also don't win anything on gambas since I'm usually running them
Just gift me a sub marioman
if the frying pan is a key does that count for gamba
Oh I totally misread the gamble
I thought it was how many were in Tubba's Castle
I'm not, I imagine most of chapter 3 hasn't been checked yet
how much was triple dip? more?
ik it was cheaper BP but yeah didn't see FP
Does that mean 0 wins the gamba?
omg Im cracking up. Banjo Kazooie has a category called NoPOG% I fucking cant!! For real tho it mean no pause overlap glitch so no note dupes
guess I'm DQ'd from the leaderboard
Yippee hunt for the last key
well I maintain that I won the bet since that's what I thought the bet was on so yeah.
Wild goose chase of a seed
Now to save up for a plando seed
We are raiding in with frogs abound?
You know it's okay! We are raiding in with frogs abound! Seasoning with some mates, if that's what caused it, everyone had that before

How much do early resets mess with that avg?
yeah cause it's an average of each split not an average of each completed run right?
whats wrong with 3 minute cutscenes
followed by back to back dumb ass tricks that end your run instantly if you're playing any%
Sunshine ik is also awful with unskippable starting cutscenes.
what makes totk bad is just the fact its long and you have multiple run ending tricks immediately lol
but thats just wr pace so most people probably dont reset
I think "Being human" is probably something you should stop doing if you wanna be as good as tas
is that the fastest attack he can doi
I also have to deal with this asshole streaming
bros the type of person to dm you saying "yo check this banger sound track out" and its just a play list of green noise
wtf is green noise? is that like environmentally friendly white noise?
"Green noise amplifies mid-range frequencies with uniform intensity. Green noise sounds are perceived as similar to ocean waves or a stream."
getting shot on the roof sounds like a CoD problem
what the hell is this I’m tuning in and Lopez is doing glitches? phanto274S
gl all! great to hear m4 again too
but does the half frame save cause you to be frame misaligned now
Mr Phantom, did you know that you can easily win at Paper Mario by removing all the plants because Nintendo uses plant based ink YEP
Yeah and then Jess projectile vomited in dreaded's room
Darn at least im here for endgame
DId both ur march madness teams make it in?
we used to for final way before my time
or like close but the current safe fight has potential to be very fast
buff hope ur spring week is goin great
I think I'm trying not to get sick. Throat's been feeling parched the whole day.
I don't like playing Paper, said the person submitting Paper
just drink during all the cutscenes
I see your in the part where Peach disguises as the guards! >:D
If you were to give Peach a cardboard box and a tranquilizer, she could be Solid Peach of Metal Gear LOL
Wait i forgot, how did Kammy Koopa figure out that was Peach??
Was it because that green guard is supposed to be protect the outside gates and the Koopatrols are the indoor guards?
Hey that could be it! haha
He's the Andre the Giant of Clubbas, he just never stopped growing.
I personally think it would be kinda rude if Mario didnt say hello
I wanna know the physics of how spinning makes Mario move faster in a straight line.
Who do you like more? Kooper or Koops?
Oh no looks like the race is decided
when your p up and d down bawkGasm
new p-down d-up route in the works.
just duplicate p-down d-up for more attack reduction.
isn't that all speedrunning games lmao.
I got a really cool doggy bandaid on my hand
random encounters are never not annoying.
I dropped a pallet on my hand at the end of my shift and it took a chunk of skin lol
I didnt feel anything and then I got back to what I was doing inside and noticed my glove was entirely red
We were out of bandaids in my dept so I took my hairtie out and just tied tissues to my hand lmao
equip both p-up d-down and d-up p-down for perfect balance.
Did you know that you can easily beat Paper Mario by removing all the trees because then they can't make paper?
the only 4 doors in the entire castle.
time to start a new run rn so you can hold B during prologue and hold B during this at the same time!
I think he just posted a PB on BSky too
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
fun stream, have a goodnight everyone!
