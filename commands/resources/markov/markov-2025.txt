Yo haven't seen you since last year Kappa
check the write up I just did in #general
thankfully my N64 is working now
yeah i seen i was gonna say try cleaning it could be overheating
Ive never opened one before but could be worth a shot
hello. happy new year, best of luck on the run
Hii Phantom, happy new year and good luck phanto274Wave phanto274GL
it was good had some crazy luck on genshin so very happy
reset now before you go any further
so will this be glitchless or a normal speedrun?
So in Kazooie I just entered mad monster mansion, 100%'d all the previous worlds and IGT says 4:20 LUL
i was thinking my pc broke
guess i dont have to clip it
Happy New yr all! and yay a nice choice
did link die as a wolf permanently?
or is he now a growlithe?
awsm gambas and predictions will no longer have an effect on me.
It takes so long to look through the emote list to pick what one I want
maybe I'll just do this one
I finally dont feel like death
Shit's still draining so still mildly yucky feeling but I'm mostly over this cold
