Yo haven't seen you since last year Kappa
check the write up I just did in #general
thankfully my N64 is working now
yeah i seen i was gonna say try cleaning it could be overheating
Ive never opened one before but could be worth a shot
hello. happy new year, best of luck on the run
Hii Phantom, happy new year and good luck phanto274Wave phanto274GL
it was good had some crazy luck on genshin so very happy
reset now before you go any further
so will this be glitchless or a normal speedrun?
So in Kazooie I just entered mad monster mansion, 100%'d all the previous worlds and IGT says 4:20 LUL
i was thinking my pc broke
guess i dont have to clip it
Happy New yr all! and yay a nice choice
did link die as a wolf permanently?
or is he now a growlithe?
awsm gambas and predictions will no longer have an effect on me.
It takes so long to look through the emote list to pick what one I want
maybe I'll just do this one
I finally dont feel like death
Shit's still draining so still mildly yucky feeling but I'm mostly over this cold
Starting soon more like starting right now
It looks good honestly if you hadn't said grape reduction I absolutely would said to call it that
If you said ayg reduction I would've produced tears
I block that part out of my mind
I'm flying back to Houston today before the polar vortex wipes me off the map
Teaching my niece in law to pronounce the days of the week
Indiana for a travel nurse contract
This was the week I would've gone to AGDQ but I decided to save money 🥲
I pronounce my days of the week by saying dee instead of day at the end
I'd fall off that loft at least once curtis8AAAAA
Very smooth turn Phan...perfect as always
I only slept 4 hours after work before having to get ready for this flight
I got a text box for you right here PantsGrab
homie wtf is a "grape demi reduction" that ain't even real u made that up ICANT also yo gl
curtis8F oh right I knew that
I swear it's there just to stop people
You almost checked for a hint
goats can eat almost anything. including time.
My ears are open amongst other things
In my I need to touch grass
I take back what I said about being smooth lolz
also that's a good quote too lmfao
I found a streamer playing tp on crowd control
Make sure you show her your rod
When you've played rando too long
I'm legally changing my name to Dragon Ball Z.
This isn't even my final form
Ok that's enough bad jokes from me
Ugh hate talking to the cuccoos too
Tail slap them twice and they're ded
At least it gets some tail for its efforts
Damn, sorry, I promised to stop the bad jokes XD
I try to turn off sass here and it just comes out naturally
Gotta love the helpful monkeys in Zelda games
he looks like a guy who saw the moon fall :P
He looks like the best Link
I wanted that phrase tattooed on me
I hope Low Transforms isn't 'normal' now LuL I can't keep doing that
you just gotta not spank him so hard
do you know you can skip the "we're gonna fight ook" cutscene?
well not by pressing start, by rolling around to the right instead of using the monkey chain to get to the central platform
since it's not a direct path back to the central platform
yay the game didn't shatter under the massive beating of a monkey this time
Is it just on my end, or did audio just get really distorted
Every time I open your chat twitch makes my whole chat purple and says please knock
I will resist the green goblin mask this time though
I cancel it myself after a few seconds just to remove your popup lol
rhone are you going to join the glitchless mm race
I kinda just run and throw in that room
strange, must have been the browser. Tried a different browser and sounds fine now.
You dont have to do this, you can swim and jump to the chest from behind
am I stupid for doing cave of ordeals 3 times to fill all my bottles with fairy tears and also doing roll goll 64 times
no, sounds like you were bored though LOL
I wanted a true 100% file
Its better than a true 100% skyward sword file :)
Imagine how long Tender Hearted took to make that.
In Skyward Sword there are tons of collectible things, and Tender Hearted took the time to fill them up for a 100% file.
i beat it once on wii game is bad
game is bad, too may cutscenes and I hate Fi
Ookless takes a while to  learn. DF has a good file.
However if you do ookless, you can throw his first bombling to make him appear faster.
nice one pokemon colloseum rando sounds fun
i just play rayman 3 i know wanna chill and enjoi yur stream
Rolling to Eldin is by far the best part of the run, I hope you enjoyed it
I played it 20 years ago and had nightmares as a child XD because of the game
when i see rayman i see supert ed from n64
i say as a child i hat my fun with super ed beatet ons
I was only able to save the game using a rumble pack, I never finished the game (couldn't save), I bought a rumble pack to save it, what do I do? I play through it without saving
i wish you good luck wreslting the naked old man
it's what's happening off screen during a shot zoomed in on Link's face during the cs before KB1
its always funny to slap him odd
my strat is the opposite, i do the issac strat, spam a until win
so i decided to bite the (higher fees) bullet and order Cane's through doordash since i hadn't had it yet lol
all you had to do was RIDE THE DAMN HORSE, LINK
insert tulio and miguel "GET. ON. THE HORSE."
I fall asleep for 2 minutes evo17Flip
honestly, i get the cane's hype
lmao 38 doesnt have many jokes about it no
the breading is the right amount, cooked well, the chicken is flavorful, and the sauce is good
oh we've had one but they aren't dashpass eligible
so i haven't tried it yet
@Mirby_Studios i read this as breeding and was very very confused
the strat is always sidestep -> B -> A
if he sidesteps while you do, still press B
his rng is more heavily weighted than Bo's, so it's always your best bet to do that
there's still some rng but in theory he is not as bad as bo
okay that cutscene is skippable with start
tp seems to be very good at documenting their stuff
erin and I try a lot with prime 2
cause some people like to upload unlisted videos and don't share stuff unless someone asks
the best speedrun documentation is the SRC guide on how to start running crash bash 200%
I upload a lot of unlisted stuff but it's all linked on zsr, as is my playlist
nah I'm doing some MM now
I don't think you can make that RTA
You can but it only saves 1f, according to Ekke I think
I think Simi has done it
I should check my english and jp disc loads to figure out what I should use for glitchless
jp is 2 seconds faster I think from text
some of the text boxes are slower but some are faster. I still think german is the fastest
I never thought to come back out via mini boss
i mean you're in a dungeon so close enough for me
I did not know you could shoot this down from here
Make sure not to die to this boss. I hear he's really difficult
look it's me when i step outside in july here
damn, hitting it from the back\
it's a cool strat. only worth it with ordon sword though
i woke up at 5 pm and decided to skip my meds today and just go to bed early
tbf i also went to bed at like, noon
i co9uldn sleep, and then at like 9:30 i cut my hair and dyed it pink
see i WANTED to wak eup at 2, but i turned off the alarm and passed back out
butyeah i take adderall so it keeps me up, so im skipping it today so i can go to bed earlier and not like, 5am
ya know i never knew you could kill those guys as human for several years until i saw speedruns as a child
idk why did you press A on the horse if you didn't wanna get on? What
i mena yeah, i got the game in 2007, i was 10
but yeah was like, late teen like 17 or so when i started waatching Kejs, first one i saw do a tp run back when he was WR and was astonished you could do it as huma lmao
FeelsStrongMan kejs had record when I started running
now im out here like, yes this owl statue chest is attainable sphere 1
yeah kejs was the first tp runner i was watching  before beest
i could ever do any% or really any speedrun
simply bcuz idk how livesplit works
it took me several hours just to get a simple timer when i started doing rando races lmao
the first speedrun I took seriously was like a 4 hour run for me at the time
but i have done 16 star for fun before
16 star is a great speedrun for funzies
I could never take sm64 seriously
I find it hard to motivate myself to learn things when I want to learn things
ill brb going to pick up food
the twilights are more fun than you'd think with practice
-15C or 5F it was awful
Oh you're going all the way in
It's Lakebed... a zelda water temple. It's gonna have cutscenes since it's so scenic
Man helms don't like you lolz
yep same thing happened to me with a metroid prime 2 run
some random guy copyright claims the lower torvus bog theme
its so annoying getting those claims removed, much easier on twitch to get it removed
like these people sample these songs in their music which is fine but they go and coptright it illegally
yeah itss ridiculous, it happens alot to me for the fishing hole theme
what rando does to your brain
i was gonna say that sound slike alie
I have a weird reason for it
i keep claw pn x bcuz bow goes on y
when me and my brother were kids he liked hookshot/clawshot on the Y button so I decided to be different have it on X
and that preference has stuck with me forever
bow goes on y bcuz id usually put iron boots there, but w quick transformm you cant equip/unequip boots on y while olding chains in gm
idk, i was never told otherwise it just became habit
my preferences are Claw X, bow Y, Boomerang Y. everything just goes where those two aren't
yeah bcuz i did bring it up to them, and then was never updated it lmao
claw has highest priority to me
most people are Claw Y Rang X
stick goes anywhere bro come on
lmao all i know is ocarina is c down
bombs also go on any c-button
but hook goes on c-right if you're using gamecube (X)
Ok I literally just tabbed back in to type and twitch told me to knock again
Anyways I just beat ys 8
I was really not caring for the story for the first while of that game but that 2nd half really pulled me in
Also multiple chars when you max out their bond were like "Adol, there's some people out there who are gonna fucking get you" so I assume that's the next game
I did pretty much everything except like a couple raid thingies I didn't feel like doing and the 1 extra thing for postgame
I 100%'d the map and treasures and all that
Actual fun game to explore in
Woke up from a seizure... I'm dizzy and have a headache
I will... decided to watch your stream until I fall back to sleep
Damn ys 9 is only 8gb
Do you know the quick knock down
Its basically just hug the wall, 5 slow rolls, walk a few steps then spinner
At least that's how I do it
yeah i can do it very rarely
its the fourth trill, i had to watch a video pointing it out bcuz its hardto describe w words
I see you're streaming on YT now too
using spinner to leave is fast btw. for some reason in stallord's room spinner has like 3 billion speed
That's actually how I noticed you were live tonight lol
I saw you live before in YouTube
i saw you live when discord told me KEKW
i saw you were live when i st down at my pc and opened twitch lol
if I like the game enough I remember it easily
ive done rando for so long i know where every chest in thje game is
do i know the vanilla contents??? absolutley not
I think I've memorized this game by now
I'm not sure if I know where every grotto or overworld chest is
i know where boss key chests are bcuz they are different looking lmao
I've never done randomizer for this game but i've 100%ed it like 5 times this year
its very fun if you know the game well
Gonna head to bed... this headache is killing me... phanto274GL with the game and have fun
im so exciting theyre working on entrance rando rn
I would probably just use the most common settings
yeah i'm spoiled by metroid prime 1/2 randomizer
and get shit out of logic
they have sliders for trick levels for each individual trick
so like they have beginner bomb jump tricks, expert bomb jump tricks
to be fair, tp rando is literally only on ver5sion 1.2
oot and mm and combo ootmm has tr5ick lists
so I would probably have to do glitchless rando because I know how to do zora armor skip/ljas and stuff but I don't know epona oob stuff
no but i mean they've only put out two major updates
I don't care too much about cosmetic stuff
all the storage stuff is kinda dumb tbh
just because you have to walk across the map to do storage
wolf fur colour change coming soon
i have their uh, github to do list bookmarked i check it like once a week lmao
maybe I'll change link's tunic color but every hud color I see someone have is so bad so it makes me not wanna change it
@Draconif i always hit rando everything unti i  see tunic colors i like, when i just match them, all up
so it's either fully glitched logic, fully glitchless logic, or no logic
no logic is really fun if you know the game really well
but yeah theyre adding freestanding, entrance rando, random starting, and portals in item pool
it didnt use to be like that
but you used to just have to go to an area at least once to get the portal
i think portals in item pool w entrance rando is gonna go hard, especially if weget the option in the future of portals go to differnt areas, but i can see that being a pain
I know rando has quick transform
rando has q transform, fast climb and fast iron boots
ive never used iron boots on sand
but i'm ok with HD qol
me wondering why you don't have spinner and bombs equipped just to remember this is the western ruleset
wait really? so i dont just suck w poe 1 skip, its the rando thnats the problem lmao
i always use clawshot anything so poe 1 skip is always free phanto274Smile
clawshot anything? is that an option??
its an option in mm rando so i just enable it for tp rando too lol
i wonder if tp bingomizer is any good
ive only done 2 bingo raaces
i never knew how to make it super consistent though
I think the aim is too high
i think you're too far right
thepri67Love dylanjLove tippiALove ghunzoLove tghLove marcoLove AmbessaLove popesLove
just carve these skull kids into arrows
i dont know of any arrow drops in lost woods
... youre supposed to use arrows? i would just do this as dog
well this are id use bomb arrows, but i think the skulls may have arrowsd here?
i think you can also hit him w claw im not sure
when you enter tot the left pot by the switch has arrows
I didn't know that one had guaranteed arrows
most pots in tot have arrows i find, its er5y helpful
press B right after you press A
this one you have to let link swing forward more
it's more precise than the other one
it's based on where the camera was in the cutscene, so you had to hold up
that bad for a run this long
any crash in a good run is annoying
only way i know quick money is that lmao
i hate that you cant warp thjere its so annoying
yeah all of them take a while. the only one that could maybe be good is the one at lake hylia bridge
and even the puppets drop like a singular arrow
I mean mm runs typically were dead to bad drops for bombs
it doesn't anymore, but it used to
i gotta go to bed, gl on rest of run
why does that dragon have a sword and shield?
Yeah, but not nearly as well
There's an arrow chest in the next room, but you probably won't go that way
It's in this room, on the ledge you're walking past now
That might actually be the optimal route for glitchless, it's been a while
minus 11. but this is rly bad. fatpidTHONK
now you have to put in the time
We could all use a cuppy of milkers
@buff00n u know good and well what i meant
Thank god I don't run this game
I wouldn't stand how long it is
Regardless, 4+ hours is something I couldn't do
Idk shit about glitchless, but I do know tpgz is your lover for this game KEKW
Can you even do it with REL?
That's the best unfortunate shit I've seen in this game in 5 years
What makes me wonder is if there's a void plane, just because I'm that curious at fucking nothing
I have mac and cheese and chicken tendies to make for later
you know which, no need to say
fireman tweking got me feeling different
this music sounds like its from the oracle games
i started my blind vaniila tooie playthru
almost about to leave whitchy world
why dont you mod the exe1 title screen on exe6
just say its the japanese version of bn1
keiz speedrun is such a call back
even you dont intend to RNG manip, simply selecting continue from the title screen is still defined as RNG manip hence why we run single segment
its only that way for 1-3 btw
4-6 capcom stepped their game up
next time make bn1 a longer ETA LUL
redo the route, add ghost navi drops and dont do reddit skip LUL
incentive to NOT DO reddit skip KEKW
ad 10 if you know the comps
I thought you didnt know life virus skip lol
also if you fail it puts you back to post magicman fight
im 20 jiggies into tooie now
btw i got confirmation my X7 shipped, how long should it take? like 30 days?
im liking my new headphones, but I knew I would. Just went from mx40 to mx50
my old pair is fine, just the headband leather is peeling very bad
I can get a zip on cover for that tho
how you were in my recommend how are the speedruns going
I find it funny that everyone in colo cord including the person who originally made the program is like yea this program is very outdated in the programming language it uses lmao
I thought c++ was good what happened AAAA
I always hated hooking up gui to backend
At least I can easily edit the sheet ratJAMMIN
I don't think any of my college friends have gotten hacked lmfao
Smart engineers at a dumbass uni
meowdy Phantom, hope the practice is going well! phanto274GL
Oh fuck it was Supernova lmao
I called Supernova soft for not blocking anyone yet KEKW
Is this a spreadsheet for mega man
Okay I was wondering what the dots were AINTNOWAY
I dunno I saw a second place on there monadoGiggle
great to hear, if you pb I'll shove an entire carrot up my ass
I know you told me, but you never know bro KEKW
as an I guess former oot runner those two emotes fit so well
you see i just told me friend to swipe for a gacha character KEKW
Just get lucky it's a skill issue
we HolidayCookie HolidayCookie cooked HolidayCookie HolidayCookie this 1st hr.
oh I don't want the carrot
even when Higsby's not manning the counter, he's still making money
" gonna storm a terrorist base, I'll be back before dinner " - Lan, probably
GG to goodness late for getting my snack
phanto274GG on the runs, better luck next time!
aww someone beat me to first
hmmm i think twitch is messing up for me. it says continue subs on both of them and no stars or info. just says try again later. and this is after reloading
so if you have a free moment,  can you inform us what the game is about :)
well the story i mean. I'm only used to the megaman x series, as well as the OG megaman 1-10
i know nothing of the battle network
basically instead of dr light making robot children, he had a family. this is his family. wily is still a spiteful jerk.
well... at least all the character portraits look like its out of a horror movie
@Mirby_Studios thanks for the explanation. so next question following up with your statement: is Dr. Light young and having kids or is he building his "family"
yeah you play as his grandson in this
gotcha gotcha. so basically you're pretty much his living legacy that goes into computers and getting rid of virus's. and the damn doc's dead
it's also that instead of robotics, the world focused on network technology, that's the biggest difference
i know this will sound stupid, but whats the games version of "network technology"   is it basically everything is a smart device?
sounds close to what we are now a days
so they are hacking our smart devices huh? I'll keep a closer eye on my thermostat just in case
now does this game have the whole level up system or do you buy your specs/progression stuff
in this one you buy the PowerUPs to increase your stats
nice, so it sounds like you don't have to do unnecessary grinding
later games in the series swap that out mostly aside from the HP increases for a heavier customization system where you can have more specific builds and such
hey phantom, gl on the run
Its a shame that internet 8 said no
escape chips not cooperating is such a pain
so story wise, the boy you play on the overworld is the grandson, and the character inside the machines is megaman? or does he have a different name
with 4 comps to run through its really hard to get escape chips all the time. Thank goodness for R button strats
I blessed the run and it paid off
the overworld character is named Lan, he's the grandson, his digital AI assistant is MegaMan
lol megaman is the new siri
*gasp* so apple stole the idea from capcom
i smell a lawsuit for megasiri
AI have got faces like navis
dude could you imagine hackers getting into your TV and playing baby shark on loop for hours on end?
before we know it chatGPT will have a face
hey as long as the face is kat dennings i'm good with it lol
they aren't even hard to beat either. Just hp sponges
now when you use the chips, do they go away permanently?
you are correct about their hp
@Shadowcire thats how paper mario sticker star works LUL
@past88345 don't think i've ever heard that game
i just know PM 64, TTYD, and only heard of the origami one
where you can turn into a paper plane and stuff like that
its the 3ds paper mario game that had a lost trailer up on youtube recently for fans to see
whenever i remember i'll have to look it up
the trailer is very different to how the final game was
the heavy reliance on stickers was already in place, and it's hard to see what unique purpose the partners served, and as such may be another reason they were cut
oh they cut out partners in future paper marios?
partners haven't been as much of a thing since super paper mario i'd say. you had the pixls sure but they were more... ability helpers than true partners
so really the only 2 games with partners were the first 2
The environments looked cooler in the trailer and mole king boss would been cool to fight
thats like making super mario RPG without a team
it's a mario RPG without a team you get so
but i mean... red apples are better than green :D
honestly with the reception to the TTYD remake i think future paper marios will be more RPGs
instead of the adventure games they were turning into
cause super had very light RPG elements already, and with sticker star and color splash those were just adventure games with even lighter RPG elements
sounds like they butchered it to make it different for "reasons"
their vision for it wasn't an RPG anymore
hoping paper mario returns to its RPG form and does creative things with the formula
and thats a evil vision lol
Indie devs have made some interesting paper mario inspired games
@past88345 open world papermario where you traverse books as "dungeons"
bug fables especially shows the potential modern paper mario has
but yeah i do know one reason for stepping away from storylines isn't even them. japanese club nintendo members shortly after super paper mario dropped (which has a heavy reliance on story) responded to a player survey with how they did not like the story at all
i swear that bot is a fever dream come to life
so like it's not even the devs entirely to blame
they got feedback from a set of fans who could take the survey and they went with that
must've been terrible to switch genres
that wasn't even to them tho lol, that was about galaxy. his advice to them was about the characters and they went overboard
yeah you can't argue with mayamoto, he is the father of it
yeah he hated the version he played, which was the version in the trailer that dropped recently
and they... didn't change much lmao
which says a lot cause he's clarified his story comment recently saying he focuses on gameplay first and foremost
so if he hates the gameplay of something, especially something mario, you fucked up lmao
like he doesn't HATE story, he just puts its importance in game design behind the gameplay. which like, fair
story is important but if the game plays like dogshit nobody's gonna play it long enough to care about any story
true, not every game has the buster max option LUL
speaking on that, i enjoy games that are 8bit with great stories and gameplay, graphics don't mean sh*t if everything is executed poorly
yeah. plus the advice he gave to intsys about "try using only existing mario characters" was just advice and people think it was a corporate mandate they had no choice but to follow. an d like no, it was a tip they could choose to ignore. they did the opposite
so devs were just being bullheaded for no reason
big shame because original characters would have made sticker star feel less lonely
true. but they were being bullheaded that's undeniable lol
intsys in recent years has said they have basically full creative control over paper mario tho and have had that so
The funny thing is paper jam having no original characters was more of budget constraints. So alphadream restricted themselves like intelligent systems
with paper jam you could tell the writers wanted to do more with it
paper jam still has fantastic gameplay at least
the fear of lacking rng chips
its so funny how protoman flinches to a charged buster shot
hopefully you don't have to fight extra bosses
just in case anyone was asleep
also that legit got my anxiety up to maximum so thanks
only 2 months from 4 years
then I gotta stop cause that's too many
I won't say anything about my ass
And gl and I'll see you after I shower
Motherfucker you wanted a Pic of me with the carrot up my ass
Hey Phantom! Hope you are doing well phanto274Jam
That flareon and fuecoco are coolness let me guess u got them at best buy?
12345? That's the password on my luggage!
have a good night my dude
god you beat me to 1st again
I've got a MAD craving for a chicken sammich for some reason
chik fil a sounds super good right now
MegaMan X music for MegaMan.EXE, I'm in favor of it
17% of your viewers have degenerate issues
@SwiftPichu_ what's the half-life on a viewer?
I had to watch that clip you shared twice to realize the run wasn’t dead lmao
how many viewers will there be left in two years?
@En_Passant 3 and half a snickers bar
Unironically for a viewer they usually are around for like, 3 year or so
both. and it being big and veiny on top
Can I tongue play with both of them?
i'd be sad if you didn't
At least this tutorial is fast
just like the midget stuff i watch
why not? i have a judgement kink
Gives me even more of a reason to do so
We'll just dm each other it's fine
that almost sounded like another Shadow quote
@SwiftPichu_ i feel left out :(
Don't tell me it's a rip from duel links
Which one is it because I never knew there was a game with VA
Oh the one game who never made it to Mexico
I got so pissed because I really wanted to play that game KEKW
All we got was falsebound kingdom and duelists of the roses
Nah, my ps2 was set to English once I realized ratchet was in Spaniard Spanish
Yugioh voice line is so good at at those pulls
then i asked about 687354 questions about it
Axl talks abt it but I have no idea how this game works at all
it was explained to me like this: the draw system is like having a deck of 30 cards, and you can buy them or win them off battles
the bar at the top during battle is when you can select more cards, or as this game puts it, chips, and use those during battle
and what phantom just explained i didn't know about lol (minus the tied up teacher, i have plenty of those in my closet)
and the ones phantom really, really wants is the chips that has a person running. those are battle escapes
I am watching I'm just also getting my nails done ATM can't talk lol
@PeachedPocky do I? this game is fucking ass
idk just battle Network in general idk which one this is
how was the the rest of that attempt?
is it just me or is there a shitton more encounters this run?
RNG is a fickle mistress, Shadow
well i am home and gotta set up for my own stream but i will be dropping a lurk!
Yes in time. How are things?
Of course always pray to RNGesus for good runs
You keep doing this run, I'll go play with a rubber band
Somehow I pronounced gutsman as gust man
Anyways BRB gonna eat gutsmans ass
yo phantom hope you're doing well swifWave
I could not get their chip ever
I don't think I ever know the one to get it from x_x
Ah, that's where I already faught them, but I guess I never managed to double delete
I tried to 100% but internet netnavi fights was awful
S ranking and not getting the V3 is brutal
Ninja Gaiden voice: "God can't help you now"
Good evening and good luck on the run(s)
let it be known i know like nothing about these games let alone whatever this is swifSip
same can be said for a lot of what i watch i come to vibe and the games are a nice bonus lmao swifLurk
network is my fave megamanned speedrun maybe the x games are ahead of it.
bn3 is my fave bc all top 10 runs on leaerboard have dif elements regardless of dumb custom style
i guess im thinking of megaquints youtube races
Whats ur take on megaman and bass?
I find the 8 robot masters the best and angled powered up weapons
Very excited for this run bbirbHeadDesk
Have u setup the scenes and other stuff btw? Im curious if u did it since its required
Would it be worth save scumming those?
went to the gym and just got back, how are runs going?
sucks to be at the mercy of RNG like that
if it’s half as hard as that doc you shared o can only imagine
are you for real you got a quil
This is epic so I get to hear voice as well.
he's the sub in case the other receptionist gets sick
neither did I but here we are
the second fight is the bare minimum right?}
oh, I just know that the colosseum you want hyper mode
I wonder what factors affect this shit
you say you wanted 2, there ya go chief
I know that's wes boo but I still see it as naruto
I mean not much you can do with the shades looking like a fucking headband
I think there's a pc at the beginning of the tower though
from this point on you want quil rxp right ?
my typing today is fucking terrible
I think just as you purify you get fucked up
Do you need blaze by a certain point?
Oh good then POG no damage
nothin like a good ole fashion bot fight
does eagun even have the pikachu in xd? it's been forever
one thing I will say though, xd is better casually for getting all the shadow mons
I wanna say yes it was like level 12 or 13
while here you're stuck with what you catch
I just wanna see if the mf evolves or run dead
The run shall not be dead not on me watch
Damn not even close was it?
what level does quilava need to evolve?
with the late hypers it makes sense
this run is just that punishing
omg that was actually so close
Way less hoping for the manip
I must conclude you for a Quilava
My brain did not do the brain thing
There was a day years ago I said I would start speed running Colosseum or XD
do you like the poison one
currently taking up space in marks hotel room
yo gl hitting frames today Phantom!
When agitated, this POKéMON protects itself by spraying poisonous sweat from its pores.
Good day and good luck on the runs! can you explain what you were doing just now?
oh nice after what you did last night? I gotta say seeing the behind the scenes made it way less daunting
I preordered Colosseum when it came out and got the jirachi bonus disk. A few years later, my brother helped me sell it on ebay for like $5
I saw the route had times in it but how precise is it in comparison to the starting?
I only ever rented Colosseum from blockbuster
for the waiting time, how precise to leave this battle?
ah okay that makes sense, just don’t want to over roll the rng
Do you have a manip for the quilava as well?
I'm dyeing my hair pink againne
Wait idk if you seen my pink hair at all
So you have to do all this setup, and then run is basically dead if you get a bad natured quilava?
Yes made it for a run.
it was. I’m just really tired today.
I even took a nap but I’m still tired
I think I’ll chill for the rest of the day and read or something
be sure to eat coin :)
Christ on psywave of all things
I had to take a nap today because i was up late thanks to rando LUL
quick, lets do World one in SMB1 swifDerp
Help me there is a lasagna in my ass
The sauce was the best part
You're doing it for memes at this point
I'm glad I missed the adamant regice I had in the last seed
what is this? good rng? in a colo run?
I was thinking the same thing lmao
is it actually working today? cause last time i remember it was being mean
There's also a consistent feel for it without the visual
I dont need to look at link to roll clip
i'm experimenting with something new: i have my taskbar at the top of my screen so i can see the clock at all times
And my 1f links in kof11 are easy just cause it's a fast rhythm that I just dont drop
I was looking at the sheet you sent me and the rng manips didnt make any sense to me lol
Apparently a lot of people do taskbar on the top
my desk fan normally blocks the bottom right of my main monitor and my water bottle does the same with my secondary
I pretty much always see it on the bottom
I always put mine down there
W11 actually prevents you from moving the taskbar entirely, but i saw a recommendation of a free app from someone i trust that lets me do that anyways lol
If you do side what's wrong with you
it's also because my work computer doesn't let me show seconds on the clock and at work i need to respond within one minute or time out every minute if the chatter is not responding for 3 minutes so i can be more accurate
i have it showing on W11, my work computer is actively blocking that option
Do a run with umbreon NOW
i mean i'll take a fry randomizer
some are garlic, some are cheese, some are chili, it's doable
a mix of waffle and curly, purely random
like of all things the bot could've said were randomized, fries are actually doable lmfao
ohey phantom you're in my area, lemme say hi :P
look as long as i'm living here i'm going to keep making the "i live in orre" jokes
are you adamant about this iceblueSmug
how many IV does it have though
how much phone number did this thing cry for KEKW
oh yeah phantom i beat digimon world data squad and i may have oneshot the final boss
it's really funny for lucemon satan mode to pop out and just get one tapped
look it's the game's fault. the optional bosses put up a fight. they take a beating. i just used the strat i used for those to actually beat them and... i guess i overbuffed lmao
as for why lucemon, game uses an original story with the characters from the show. well the DATS members from the show.
it deals with the seven demon lords
i'm sorry, this is dub. seven deadly digimon :P
but yeah one of those characters is voiced by roger craig smith and like 80% of his lines are delivered with what he would go on to use for his sonic voice
so i just started calling that character sonic
the battle system relies on your digimon's emotions and your available commands are based on how your digimon feels and while you can somewhat affect their mood with items or support commands its still somewhat random.
and choosing moves they don't want to do (represented by showing up the fewest times on screen) lowers your friendship with them
also annoying when you have evolution requirements that require a certain amount of command categories used and your digimon never wants to do that lol
there is one funny quirk with this system tho
so once you meet all requirements for an digivolution you have to trigger it in battle. so your tamers go digisoul charge
but marcus has to hit digimon to get that energy
and... if he KOs a digimon you skip your turn and have to come back around to try again lmao
there was legit one battle where both enemy digimon were at like barely any health so i had to wait til NEXT BATTLE to digivolve agumon cause marcus would've ko'd either of them
but yeah the game did not get good reviews. i guess the battle system didn't vibe with reviewers
but having beaten it... it's not bad. i've played much worse
i've played worse digimon even lmao
i mean i was doing hardcore RA so no save states lmao
but i did fast forward a lot
also the RA leaderboard for game time beaten relies on in-game time which... is sped up when you fast forward!
so i beat the game in 44 hours. which is not at all accurate
the nice thing is it only pops up on screen once you get to the final boss's phase 2
so it's not showing you game time the entire damn game
that's how i noticed it was based on the in-game timer cause the RA overlay also sped up when i fast forwarded lmao
at which point... feels like the leaderboard shouldn't be a thing if you are punished for placing in it for using a convenience feature
like i don't mind the "steps taken" leaderboard which, while silly, doesn't get messed up by fast forwarding
so it's a low bar for the quilava to clear then :P
look it can't possibly be worse than the LAST quilava. with two 1 IVs
i take full responsiblity when this quilava has 3 0s
i asked maddy to pick up paper towels at costco. did not expect them to come in just now with a fuckin' TWELVE PACK
is that like trying to get out of first cycle
So I take it you got the framer? PogBones
was joking with maddy about how you just said you hate spoink and maddy went "everyone hates spoink spoink is a terrible pokemon"
Well maybe you should tell Quil to get it together
are you duping great balls there?
Ok. I'm debating, do I order a pizza or go get sandwiches
Yeah. First turn item glitch. If you use an item during your first half of the turn, in the second half if you swap the locations, the game uses the index of the location to remove it from your inventory, but it uses the item you originally selected
Well. Quil. I said get it together. And you didn't.
well it's not WORSE than the last one
On the plusle side, Espeon is pretty good
Although I'm just gonna say it. A game full of double battles and a plusle with no early game minum to snag is a prosecutable crime
your doing the exact same thing as the last time I opened stream and idk what’s happening
I look forward to that. I saw you talk about it in the podcast
colo has started popping up in my youtube algorithm and I have no complaints
Ahh RIP apparently I forgot to use a coupon a couple weeks ago. Oh well
So get the framer or very specific frames late 4Head
hey - that means you can be off by 2 frames twice, if you're late - right? swifDerp
correction: "just be an even number of frames less then 6 late to the first and you gucci"
It's not that hard 4Head it's only impossible
Personally I think it'd be more fun to get it
You should try setting flowtimer to the pause button on livesplit btw (since pause starts livesplit)
Also I have seen 3 espy and I've also seen 4 espy
Please one more? I've been in the hospital almost all day
We all love one more PogChamp
Just how far you'd get then?
phanto274GL and HF on the runs
thank you for giving me something to watch while everyone else is at GDQ
btw I finished Banjo last night
Tooie is top tier, people sure do shit on iit alot
only thing I didnt like was Grunty taking me 2 hours
It's worse level design with everything taking 10x longer for no reason
canary mary is meh (second go around) but outside of that it's not AS bad as people insist it is like it's Rare's greatest sin
"no reason" it's a bigger game
I'm talking about incredibly long cutscenes for basic actions
I never cared for the first Banjo, so
Coney during his last event restream was joking about how it would be an incredible challenge to get a jiggy in tooie before a sonix set finished
The button mashing rubber banding to almost impossibility
yeah cloud cuckooland canary mary is awful i won't deny that
the longer missions was what I loved about it, wish modern mario had more fo that
like if SMO had interconnected worlds that played off each other id enjoy it way more
honestly i'd rather a sequel make the collectibles maybe a bit trickier to get than how half of them in kazooie were basically "walk up press two buttons get jiggy"
@Axl_SR What is, Jak and Daxter, for $500 Axl_SR
jak doesn't do that nearly as much as you think
You dont like 10fps in a game that moves slow?
wait that's eggman from the moviews
maybe one or two things but
It's such a good feature that pokemon brought it in for sv
Ima go sleep now though, developing headaches again ._.
good luck on the run and stuff
damn, they really left her in a bag out in the desert sun, dude's are lucky she's still alive
sure the frame is rough at times but thats the version AP is using so you just get used to it
holy pulled an Espeon already gl gl phanto274GL
as long as a world "feels" connection, I don't care if it really is or isn't
a consistent 30fps is fine, I'm not sure why it's considered "unplayable" all of the sudden
SV started to make me feel nauseous if you stayed in the lake areas too long
Modern games on console running like that is inexcusable
I never noticed it watching streams or it but I’m sure that’s something that doesn’t come across like that
i know someone that HATES when a game is capped at 30 cause it's apparently a disservice and no game should ever be that low
I fully believe it, it’s such a shame I hope they learned their lesson
Game Freak can NOT fuck up Black & White remakes, people will trash their HQs
as long as that studio is allowed to cook this time
cause ILCA can cook when allowed to, i've seen it
so i blame TPC for the issues in BDSP
@buff00n *Whomever makes the Black / White remakes can NOT fuck 'em up
I mean they sure did for gen 4 and that is more beloved
Gen 5 is a better base shell though
So it is harder to make it ass
I like Gen 5 mostly cuz TMs don't break
also it was announced today that an upcoming booster pack for the digimon card game is entirely Cyber Sleuth themed
DP are ass that game wasnt fun till plat
i can't wait for the option card where i blow out my opponent's ear drums with the title theme
i like some Gen5 mons but i'm thankful that BW2 eased up on the "unova only" idea
it’s true, the evolutions levels were stupid but I’m glad B2W2 opened the selection at least
the evolution levels were AWFUL for unova mons. like WHY do i have to wait to SIXTY FOUR
I’m iffy on Gen 5 too
i guess you find the mons unfezant
FUCK the fire starter, that thing ALWAYS gets fucked up whenever I use the bastard
look i'm forever mad that they changed the name of bouffalant's signature move
here it's the boring HEAD CHARGE
that sounds so much cooler and better lmao
in bw2 you can get a lv30 one with the overworld encounter
also i maintain that Emboar should've been named Boarbecue
Same route pretty much though lol
Pretty sure the volcarona is 35
reminder that braviary's JP name is WARRGLE
I started playing W2 a while ago just so I could try Braviary before 54 or whatever level it evolves
and that's just fun to say
What the fuck is that volcarona emote
that feels more like singles though
@Pallos7 you don't understand the culture
that' s what i was getting at lol
i just didn't want to type competitive
is it possible? we have a runnable quilava?!?
is mild bad for the purifying and hyper mode necessary?
The gen 5 walking meme wins
I just moved my setup and had an old monitor from work as my third and oh my god is it a game changer
I mean you stream enough lmao
that was the only reason I wanted one since Pape takes up a whole monitor and everything is scrunched
i don't have room for a third monitor. i could fit one on my desk and plug it into my computer but i don't have a spare outlet for it lmao
I need to replace this laptop, so it might be time to get a PC
if / when I do, I'm grabbing a 2nd monitor. 2nd monitor's OD
I had to get monitor arms to fit them all otherwise I’d have zero deskspace
Fair I have a decent size ikea desk or I’d have no hope at all
I have 2 27” and a 24” so that’s probably why you don’t struggle with 2
Time for twitch handle number 1 Moltres fan to enter the chat
I don't feel like describing my setup, so I'll post a picture to Discord
Oh I thought the bot just said that for a sec
Axl gonna fly out the bot Pog
His brows and stache makes me think of bobobo
Oh shit I'm back in ad city
Shall observe it as thoroughly as possible
Did you have to get the party together to advance the RNG?
Okay that makes more sense and I’m assuming an everdrive
and it's specifically the moltres that advances the rng?
oh wait I’m not thinking right, I’m sure you can just use tool to import the team
not me thinking people are busting out their GameCube link cable
Phan that was actually legit question. Idk if someone will do something
giving you a lot of fast ones today
oh my god not the split
Operation get Phantom a good Espeon phanto274Ban
Holy no wonder Mild is so rare
oh my god you’re rolling for that just for the last fight that’s wild
with enough defense, do you ever survive that crit from your first run?
I doubt it considering base stats but maybe there are some rolls that live
Might be 65 if I remember the eeveelution numbers that are swapped around
Couple that with a middling base HP and you get Furret being scary
yeah the level is not in your favour either
How long do you consider waiting, like 4ish minutes?
And what's 5 and a half at this point?
do you have the gameboy cable for 4 moltres?
it would save a lot of time in the long run
But a lot of work to setup
Who doesn't love a fire flying type
I had to look it up, Oricorio
I think they're in S/V now too
I know they were definitely in Kitakami, the ghost ones
But i've never used in my life
You would have missed like 2 tries so far Sadge
This, resetting every time and hoping sounds horrendous
It feels like it would be around 10-12 in
jeez. I didn't realize it was that expensive
I wonder which ones aren't these days
No no, 39 is better than 50 YEP
damn, a hooker spit on me AND you're streaming on a Friday? Todays been fanstastic
That's not a hugely favourable range to kill either
That’s right that fight was horrendous
if you could get the flamethrower tm…
Or typhlosion didn’t learn it in the 50’s or 60’s
that’s fair it is a pokemon speedrun
that espeon is quite literally nice
so it’s not killing Duskull is what you’re saying lol
it just had to be better. didn't have the skill to do that
That would be a great idea
"Will this Quilava be runnable? No. No but in Spanish."
and for your espeon to not get ganked by a furret afterward
want me to make 1 real quick
one of my favorite series of games ever
I never thought but these must have almost max friendship to start off with too
Wow I actually got 10 Phantokens EZ
The Devil that Walks to a Gen 5 tune
Just because of heart gauge levels?
wait was that THE GUY we saw OUTSIDE
In the second game it's revealed it's actually his first day on the job haha!
It's in one of the news stories "it's revealed that his story of 40 long years of cranking gears is a lie and it's closer to 39."  And since the 2nd story is set like a year or so after the first one haha.
Yo, the first time I've seen a Colosseum speedrun in a Colosseum
Because they wanted to be a special kind of speedrunner
I can only imagine someone losing a run to a 1/256
the odds of something happening might be small but it will happen
Pokemon is one of those games where it happens 100% of the time 1/256th of the time
Like when you are born there is an RNG role, and if it lands on 256, your pokemon will always leave hyper mode
Your killing my cousin!  He owes me fish...
Wow, you're such a good trainer! Let me escort you into our guarded base without considering who you are!
But that's why it has speed boost D:
I love how your pokemon don't listen to you, except to attack, UNLESS they are GMO'd to not feel emotion are hyper... That makes sense
They could have put any other text there
How hard would it have been to say "Espeon is already paying attention to you"
See. Like that. It's meaningless to use that item here. Not the item didn't work, just it doesn't mean anything in this situation. Game devs are aware of that concept
But calling your Pokemon can't just simply be meaningless, no Espeon have to SPECIFICALLY just not be listening to its trainer except for battle commands
Ok I actually love this game it's just one of those details that I'm like "Someone specifically wrote that and it doesn't make sense"
hi phantom i have a question for you
you sent us like.. 5 boxes of floss
there is so much of it
It has your name on it from amazon
Your teeth are gonna be SO clean
I am deadass serious, it has your name on it, and there's so many of it
ok I type that and twitch once again asks me to knock
I looked at it and I was like.. "phantom doesn't live here anymore..." *opens it* "Huh this is kinda heavy... what is- oh that's floss.. oh god.. why is there so much of it??"
Like.. if it was 1 maybe 2.. I'd understand
is it always oblivious? or is it thick fat? I’m assuming abilities randomize between the 2?
I wish I saw the damage range
ooo a run instead of  watching fire types :P
the model looks weird to me
It has an edgy Galarian form
i dont not like them just the modle
@darkapplequeen We needed to snag the Meditite
Otherwise in terms of Pokemon we will have no pokemon
And if we have no pokemon in a Pokemon game, you're just a loser
And we didn't Speedrun to be a loser
is it back to stare at fire types time again
AND we get the added side benefit of rescuing a GMO pokemon from an evil person and an extra body
Imagine missing when lunging yourself knee first
it sure isn’t Gen 1 crit rate
I swear someone at Pokemon put some secret line of code that checks if "good" rng would actually be bad in the situation, and if so, guarantees it
i think flareeon on background needs to be closer for good luck
would this manip be different if performed on a gamecube instead of a wii?
Best platform to be GBA games: GC. Best platform to play GC games: Wii. Best platform to play Wii games: Wii U. Best platform to play Wii U games: The DX/Deluxe re-release for the Switch Kappa
You know what they need to do
They need to make a PokeBall where the red/white is sideways and call it the Miror Ball
It's a special ball that has an extra catchrate for lotad and ludicolo
Or maybe like any "dancing" pokemon
Should be the one around 14x
Unless there's multiple around that, then gl lol
@Swiftalu oh look who it is
holy snot this new rng program has HUGE font
Did Juan finish approving updates or
Nah I can wait it's chill
Yo it's a very fast alu swifWave
Banjo kept me up at nights, I ccan finally sleep now
I was hearing the voices in my sleep LUL
Just do both runs at the same time
honestly glitchless could be the wave for me, ive only done any% (very hard and time consuming)
did you do your BN event already?
It's like TP Glitched but without the glitches
You gotta attempt to connect with its heart
Wait why do we call it here?
Dude your mode is so hyper you don't even know
Oh hey you finally got a good espeon?
The espeon met all of the required stats on the postinf
A bad colosseum in the game dedicated to colosseums
The important thing is that we get the spoon this time
I, personally, forbid it with the power I invested in me
seems were on a run. Back from halftime my buckeyes are up.
has pape dropped in price? my local is selling it for $55. Never seen it that low
they have jet force gemini for 15, that surprises me
Dude you could revive someone with that revive
You really needed to heal D:
They don't need your modern medicine
Oh. I'm being informed apparently they do
It's about the principle of the matter
Seeking specific performance, not monetary gains
im slowly replacing my shittily hacked together UI with a better one on my speedrun timer
i did some speedruns with it tho, it does work
also im like 5 minutes away from bopping a pc runner on the hl2 leaderboards lol
it being harder means i have to be more careful and more precise
Miror is timeless never gets old
and then if i ever run on PC again i can use strats i came up with for xbox to make it really easy lol
Wait did your quil die again
I saw it died a couple of times in pyrite and was like oh no
But at least sheet will not assume ty if you don't evolve
People have done first fight no ty lol
Hey at least it wasn't crit sixeTada
Oh I saw, Zeke told me lmao
Was like "That's why I am scared to use confusuon"
"BALTOY was burned!" "BALTOY was hurt by its burn!" "BALTOY fainted!"
"BALTOY was burned!" "BALTOY used Cosmic Power!" "BALTOY's SP DEF and DEF rose!" "BALTOY was hurt by its burn!" "BALTOY fainted!"
Thanks Swift. I was having trouble keeping up
The defenses might be wrong but it might as well be 1 message with how fast they pop up
Wynaut at least isn't too bad of a lead
Dude that Geodude just got geo'd
I moved all shifted info + that in there so you don't need to scroll up and down
(I hated scrolling up and down)
Great start for sure but its tied going into 4th.
"Oh fuck does Venus target my dumb fuck fire fish lemme just SCROLL ALL THE WAY UP TO FIND OUT then scroll ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN"
your brain is too big phantom
Also it's ok your not the first person to not know about using the miscinfo tab lmfao
I don't really have a better way to call it and already noted it down at the top about the change
Sorry, I didn't read what Swift said, can someone TTS?
So you want me to tts you say waynerHmm
Cheer100 shadow: Also it's ok your not the first person to not know about using the miscinfo tab lmfao I don't really have a better way to call it and already noted it down at the top about the change People just hate reading
I would have read it but I hate reading
he just went rrrrr he didnt get to am
think it had to be confusion ty kill shrew
Most of my notes now are the premium tts voices I'm so limited here >:(
I just got shadow and kkona so we get dying and screaming
I guess I can make shadow say foods
Cheer100 shadow: fettuccine alfredo (silence) cappuccino (silence) beef burritos (silence) creme brulee (silence) croissants (silence) Crème Fraîche Meringues (silence) cheese soufflé
YEP Shadow said all those completely correctly
i love how he says creme brulee
ok cool I didnt remember if this one was laughing or yelling
do you have these on some document you copy / paste from ?
this is one of my favorites lately
Cheer100 kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,,
it's a normal thing to type
I have this conversation almost every day
I forgot how long this one was oops
can't wait to see how the bot uses that
The bot hasn't pulled any of my tts to my knowledge yet
Why would people be trying to sleep when they can watch Colosseum?
it would use way more commas
all the kkonas use a billion , and ' to space it right
D: you just took the spoon away
Now how will Espeon eat ice cream?
Cheer169  eggman: you thought you could trick me with that fake emerald, didn't you? tails: so... how did you know it wasn't the real one? sonic: tails! eggman: because you just told me, fox boy!
I guess TTS Monster doesn't support eggman and tails voices sadge
They might just be premium ones
It's not too bad considering you heal right after this I guess
Venus is a planet, of course you lose to it
What do you think Rui does after this game?
I love this sequence. You find a key to use a key to steal a key
And you let two detainees escape
Instead of .. you know... Just finding the key
I love how she just gets on the TV to be like "Yo you didn't catch them yet :( Big sad okay bye"
My buckeyes are goin to the Natty baby!
We do like TM 17 :)
Gone are the days Espeon KO'd pokemon out of love for you
Just use the Pokemon go use moves until all of her pokemon faint. It works every time
Just curious is there a reason we do the full heal first?
And full health means no fainting, in some cases
That specific teddiursa is the teddiursa they made into a shadow in XD. New lore
Maybe if it sang better it wouldn't need to cry
It would be unoptimal to miss so he doesn't do it
no fire blast this run i suppose
You know. These villains are not very smart. If they installed mantraps in their elevators they'd have been far more successful at every venture
They should hire me as a consultant
D: Plusle? But Plusle is gonna get absolutely murdered
lol this is a fun exploit
Also, I like how in XD it's clear they renovated this lab and changed it to be more secure
But it's still the same structure
Also. That brings an interesting point. Who the hell is a construction contractor in this region?
whomever they are, they don't ask questions
"What's that? You want a giant pyramid laboratory base with a giant generator at the top that can be overvolted by pressing a button over and over?
Ohhh. I didn't even register the fact that you just took all the pokes out of your party
Like I give them a pass with Relagem tower. Since there's the casino cover business
And a giant colosseum which is tourism and entertainment
And like... Who built the deep colosseum and was like "Yes. Giant pit under a giant city in a ravine under the city where there's no sunlight. OSHA approved"
You know. I just had a cool idea for a game mechanic I want them to implement now
If you use a move that steals Keckleon's held item it should get an instant +10 boost to all stats
Drat the run had to end this way
That would have activated Blaze :)
Unfortunately it also can't use moves
Umbreon destined to be in the box forever
Ahh okay I see what you mean by the targeting now
When have I ever steered you wrong?
Raikou considered Quick Attack but didn't consider Strong Style
This now breaks my staying up time this yr.
We all need to stay up
Ok Ty it's all on you
I’m not streaming tonight I’m going to bed
damn come back and run o7
ima try n lurk snooze sleep so talk a lot ok mr strimmer?
Uhm I can't help but notice a high discrepancy
Who runs TP .. for fun?
What's up? Taking a break from math because something is wrong with my formula XD
That's like paying taxes for fun
It's better than me who is really tempted to try a 100% no hit run
So I'm gonna say I'm gonna lurk so I can work on my project but I probably won't actually work on it or actually lurk
for emerald I added type shuffle, so all fire poke would be rock for example
did you see how lopez attempts went?
cant wait to die to a ice trap and everyone o7 also KEKW
Paper Mario is where runners go to experience hell
yeah, that does rhyme well PrideLaugh
if it burns my ears, yeah ohheyi30Hehe
Fire does that too but it doesn't rhyme
extract the oil and take a bath in it
I played the Switch game when that came out
i played master duel like 3 days ago it was still shit KEKW
I stopped playing Pokemon TCG around the Unova sets
dont think i could get back into yugioh nowadays. looks too crazy compared to back then
I used to play a Serperior heal deck and then an elektross energy recovery deck
i am just so done with yugioh
YuGiOh isn't a game, it's an introductory competitive law class
It's all about who can summon Barrone the fastest and then win. Anything else isn't playing it's just goofing around
Yeah Yu-Gi-Oh right now is rather crazy with how the decks now are
Most decks is just half handtraps and then your engine of choice
I think we need to pull the Pokemon strategy. Do a one time ban of everything and then slowly reintroduce things so the game is reasonably paced again
Blue Eyes is set to get some new supports soon
I get it. They want tournaments to be quick, but two turn win or scoop isn't fun
But you don't get it! Their eyes were blue!!
idk what my fav deck is anymore
A link 1 and a few new tuners/synchro Ultimate Dragon and a XYZ
New Ultimate Dragon is flipped stats from ultimate dragon
Which allows Blue Eyes to run Crimson Dragon
Just got out the most difficult shower I've ever taken
D: that beast is so twilight
That targets something with a level on your field sends itself back to extra and then summons a dragon synchro from extra with the monster whose level you targeted
Yoooo let's go I love using the Crimson dragon for decks that never used the signer dragons ever
uh oh phantom is on that tp glitchless grind
And it counts as a synchro summon so it bypasses all the summon restrictions
And new Blue Eyes can summon both it's new synchro ultimate dragon and CD easily
Basically, you can get a free Quasar dragon which normally requires an accel synchro and has to be synchro'd but Crimson cheats it out as long as you can summon it and any other level 12
Which lets you put out another level 12 Dragón Synchro most often being either Cosmic Quasar or Stardust Sifr
It's not toxic because they used lead free paint
Dark Magician really needs that level of support
And because it returns to ED, you can just summon it again next turn assuming you haven't lost by then
Mostly just the metalmorph stuff that helps to bond both it and Flame Swordsman together
Dark Magician is just too easily interrupted with modern decks shitting out handtraps like Ash or Called by
Blue Eyes monster: "Once per turn, you can force your opponent to forfeit. This effect and it's activation cannot be negated". Red Eyes: "Once per duel; Increase this cards attack points by 1, then your opponent gains 10,000 life points"
Because handtraps are basically half the deck now
Ash, Droll, Infinite, Maxx C, etc.
Yeah Mulcharmy and Maxx C together is cancer
Because if you don't deck them out they will reload their deck
Because Mulcharmy will force your hand to return to max size while sending the rest of the cards back into the deck
At least Maxx C is limited to 2 in the OCG
I love when my opponent throws a maxx C right before I summon 3 trickstar lycrois
More or less Yu-Gi-Oh right now aims to prevent the other player from playing the game
Because they want tournaments to be quicker
And if you can FTK even bettee
Just take 6 prizes in a single attack
Could totally reach there...he just had to jump
me going to sleep   have fun and good lucky phantom
mark is going to give me our wii so ill be learning this run soon o7
i loved this game so much as a kid it was the first one i tried to play as fast as possible
time save for next run YEP
cant believe they made a whole game from that smash stage
I see a lot of gold
i will say i am learning more about the game
D: That was my favorite eldin bridge
@Zeliversal I hear you could get lucky in Hyrules version of the Ikea market, they make new ones regularly KappaPride
tippiLurk gl with the run tippiLove
these 2 bugs are quite literally positioned to be a pain in the neck
honestly? couldve just repositioned them - there's 2 wide fields
coulda put one by the owl statue as like a mental "ahaaaa!" once ya then get domrod
so as to encourage having seen them and such
like - ik HD cut some of them out, but cutting them out to me feels like the silliest of solutions when MQ OoT (even if in sections very awkwardly) showed slight repositionings as a solution
I never made it past the temple and the volcano
Forest temple / Death mountain ya mean ilsolaro? tippiTap
if I were to, from asthetic I'd give AG, GM and CitS in that order their slots in this, from gameplay tie-in to visuals it'd be AG, Snowpeak and CitS in that order
with Snowpeak taking the "this is hilariously dumn for a zelda game" spot
I get that and also the not inherently intuitive controls of certain things inside of it
but I do like how it behaves despite that
in repetition, 100% Snowpeak is the worst if you dont know jack about how to cheese some things
cus then you're on a very extended and exhausted railroad
not just the HP chest, that one I give a pass - I more mean the extended "I know this happens now, but round and round i go"
for all respective forced roundabouts you gotta take
like - it encourages thinking vastly out of the box to the point where you can accidentally break into the other spheres of "planned pathing"
these 2 bulblin up there are my biggest enemies btw
ever since I did the cheevos for this KEKW
She got her licenses from a inside a cereal box, give her a chance
aw man you skipped the cutscene where Link looks at Telma's tits twice oranLUL
silly question btw, phantom, derpy curiosity: what in videogames ya think takes up the most space? models, graphics, cutscene related things?
Also whatcha submitting for Speedtember this year? oranMonka
I would then be thinking of prerecorded cutscenes rather then ingame render - ingame render is code which is nothing for itself really
The longer the better tbh LOL
Oh this year slots will be 12 hour streams for 4-5 days, starting in the day and ending in the night.
But submissions are open till May so you got a lot of time
I would hazard a uninformed guess in times for glundo TP are in the 9 to 10hr range, yea? if you're zoomies?
oh huh, I thought its a wee bit more KEKW makes sense though
also makes me decently happy then given glundo is essentially zoomies casual hundo which I think I had like a 11hr file save at entrance to final fights like one time?
obv. thats not really anything to go by + not single sitting run and shit, but it rly does sound like glundo then is just "do that but very much so more planned and better"
hear me out: its not OoT water temple
the water dungeon is almost always the best dungeon in the game
except this one I think snowpeak is better
But I HAVE played this game
I hope you're well swift PrideLaugh
I need a guide every time for this one
@Jonxhas I am good hbu tippiSway
@Swiftalu for once more then just living, I actually feel not void KEKW
i need a guide whenever i do water, great bay, or lakebed, and any others i'm forgetting
AFTER YOU JUST SAID THAT IT WASN'T THAT BAD
GBT for me is sadly down to like 8 minutes now 😅
I played WAY too much MMRando
the most "ohhh" to me out of the 3 examples
I mean at least this isn't the sky temple shit
God that dungeon is ass too
top 3 dungeons in zelda series
That dungeon is the most frustrating one for me
1. snowpeak 2. temple of time 3. great bay temple
I love the design of it I just hate ball chain
GBT the temple is pretty cool, but GBT the experience is brought down by its bosses
I still like Snowpeak, you saw me putting it just behind AG for overall feels and vibes
its peak "haha lmao me silly" the dungeon
I do find it funny cause I recently replayed this game and it was such a breath of fresh air after skyward sword lmfao
WHY DID THEY MOVE BACKWARDS LOL
That's fair but I didn't mind that
you just reminded me of the pain when I was on 59/60 poes
I just waited and scrolled twitter or somethin
I literally SCOURED THE FUCKIN WORLD WAITING 10MIN EACH TIME FOR NIGHT
just do that during a run
temple of time and day/night? KEKW
literally like going to OGC in OoT
and I didnt think of it casually like ever that thats a thing which happens
hell, bulblin camp suffices for that too
"just go back there when ya need night time" never occured to me
I like spending 3 minutes going to arbiter's again instead of spending 4 minutes waiting for night
If you're phantom, then who's Ganon Sus
and fun fact that does NOT work on Wii 1.0
saving and quitting in Palace of Twilight also sets it to night time
@RubixTheSlime totally not me over here internally crying over memories of sitting there for over 4 real hours scouring hyrule for poes
Everyone here is the same person
It's the same for me as well
draconifs on my end is slightly lighter on the blue then mine
i can help the color problem
its the same overall range my non-trained eye would say, just a different shade of dark
That is copyright and theft and I will not stand for it
but can you sit for it?
there needs to be an enemy named bob
Yeah that's right I'm stealing colors too SirMad
@Draconif but there is, they are just called BOB-Omb
and they are in Mario games
one of the helemasaurs in lakebed named jake
but they sure as hell (in this one at least) love to be proactive
and that one cave where you deal with them loves to be painful KEKW
which honestly I dont recall if it has a heart piece or not, but I always went and did that one casually
fuck knows why if there isnt a heart piece there
not the worst enemy in zelda, the worst enemy is game controller from skyward sword
I think the freezard blocking the boss key in snowpeak should have a name
it kills me more than any other
eventually I will do glitchless again
in 2014 I did any% and a couple of all dungeons. in 2016 I did glitchless
and now for morpheel to take a swim at the ceiling
I think this wasnt even the worst
could have been one more random circle
imagine that cursed RNG where you get a 3minute cutscene for morpheel being unable to path to here KEKW
if you can manipulate RNG during the cutscene in any way, that makes me want to make a TAS of just Morpheel taking literal minutes
ya would truly wish that these 3rd party nonsense claims would not be okay ye
"who's ready for DMCA? this song will--" *cut to ad*
I suddenly feel bad for loving this song. dropBlind
you dont have to feel bad for that
time to see if a certain piece of bridge will again show us weird collision KEKW
i love those keese, or at least the way they taste
just give me the signal next run and i'll run ahead to take care of them
I mean - leathery texture has to be part of it
Link out here wanting to give up again up here KEKW
he nearly went under that bridge again!
"i forgor how my legs work"
I saw him think about sticking his head under it KEKW
and I BET the reason is silly simple
the bridges are as suggestive as the gates
the bridge isnt a single piece object model-wise
but each bridge segment is its own
as in "one bigger model, but separate pieces with lil gaps in the floor"
and then ya apply the wind jostling it about to the mix and you get "oh its not a platform during this frame"
either cus too high or too low or too weirdly angled during the cycle
ya should just model a piece of bridge like that more like say, a carpet or a cape really
you an apply textures to it to make it be seethrough where ya need it no prob
just - make it internally be more cape / carpet like
or maybe just like 3 total cuboids
more thinking one slim cuboid and then ya apply animation-cycle based deformations to it
which you can then line up with where you want the pieces of the wooden bridge (this instance) to be
actual cloth like physics I would assume could pose hassles in other places if you have that overall type of object elsewhere as like curtains as an example
"what if the player all of a sudden can walk up vertical pieces of cloth" and shit
*makes a game entirely out of cloth collisions and billboarded models*
You can time it pretty easily
Its like right before link jumps the gap
shame this is glitchless, this cutscene but human link is my favorite
there is but it takes 2 hours
i've seen it done before, idk where
and when would Low% get MS
low% gets master like like any% does
wolf link taming epona is a close second
Yeah that one is pretty hype
I'm excited for that when I run 100%
"human link pulls the master sword" only wins because you can fully see what's going on
actually, i think my favorite glitched cutscene of all is hitting the goron mask right as you return deku princess
I just love the theme of Snowpeak a lot
the effect is small and simple, but amusing. deku princess cranes her neck to look you in the face but the monkey just stares at your crotch
Exploring an abandoned military outpost is really cool
@RubixTheSlime belly button camera is strong
and funnier with goron then with zora I bet
You know I never thought about that, this is the only 3D Zelda like that too
i discovered it on accident and nearly died laughing
in Skyward sword your only bomb "drops" are from plucking bomb flowers
You get drops in Skyward Sword
musta forgotten those then, cus like - early in it feels so low in how often ya get them that my brain always just filled back up
and "later on" you really dont care much anymore cus you can have extra pouches if you want to
I do really like that feature in Skyward Sword though, plucking the bomb flowers and being able to store them later
or "shoot an arrow and be able to recover it if its in the wall"
how do you grow those things domestically, asking for a friend
which I dunno if skyward sword did that, but wanna say TP and Windwaker do both allow you that
Yo that happened to me the other day when my shield was on fire and I lost my shield due to it
Nah I didn't bother at that point
Since it technically wasn't really needed for anything
Its actually faster to roll up the stairs there
the stars aren't a slope so it doesn't kill your roll speed
Right before the key, you took the ramp
its also faster to do whatever TAS does
Yeah the Redead kill here actually surprised me when I saw Beest's strat for it
I knew I was a Tall Ass Stepbro
Don't worry Link, you can quickspin when you feel like it
I've found that rotating the stick slower than you think makes quickspinning more consistent
poe not be cringe challenge: impossible
invisible maze rooms not be cringe challenge: more impossible
link: "aight imma just put this spinner thing in my pocket"
not all the way in the corner though. just the general left wall
the spinner is def one of my fav tools
I've watched too much 100% I questioned why you ignored the poe
imagine if there was a random furry you could transform in front of
i for one would probably sleep better knowing the wolf that keeps running through town is actually just a human
i'd also be very jealous of the shapeshifting power
i want to be like yeto when i grow up
Yeto's basically the "eh whatever" person, lets you in his house and everything
who knew that bombs and jobs had so much in common
ball & chain makes block puzzles so much better
chillfos giving skyword sword game controller a run for its money
If you pb I will shove a turkey up my bunghole
I will not send proof you degenerate bastard
also who said anything about sending proof other then you Pichu? KEKW
did you hit the one spot where its a problem KEKW
Snowpeak heard you had a chill time so far
but the repairs are another 200 no? KEKW
Yeto and Yeta are into lock play
they keep a safety key in the chapel because you gotta unhorny to get to it
dont get trolled too hard by the game
does the golden cock taste like chicken, gold, or cock?
in other news, my medicine has worn off
I'm convinced most streamers are just torsos
must attend glubbers's run on GDQ
but also came to say i dressed up as link for halloween in 2015
if streamers are torsos to the viewers, what are viewers to the streamer
no way, i dressed up as link for a different even in 2016
would it force me to go live if you answered my knock one of these times
That'd be very funny if it did
i even sewed my own hat, and hennaed a triforce on my hand
i cant even chat so :(
i don't watch much gdq these days
Their chat is understandably sub only during the main events lol
aka only if i specifically plan it for someone i know
And that's been it so far lmao
i haven't seen any of this week lmao
I also really only watch it when its someone i know
i watched the no a button press SM64 run, that was cool
I watched the opening Pikmin run
I haven't watched gdq runs in a while
after going to one in 2019 it's just not the same
though maybe i'll watch back some things
i'd love to go some day, but money
I'll watch friends' runs but I won't go out of my way to watch it
or a game I really like
if mark and i didnt have to leave on thursday we were gonna be taking shots, so there was no watching runs
I always kill the lizalfos with bomb arrows on the first trip
makes the 2nd trip so much less annoying
you can do it pretty fast if you group them together
Seems the game was done in time for a stream. GLHF
why doesnt the statue roll when you roll. inaccurate movement, game literally unplayable
the statue also 1 shots the lizalfos
I think the statue should explode if link dies
where do i get a dominion rod that's bedroom compatible
also is there a submission rod
in this context it's a 1 shot. I think it does 10 hearts
the order is up, left, down right, up right, left, up left
but snowpeak is the coolest. peak gaming
AG can be a little dry sometimes
hey would you like a yellow rupee
that's TAS RNG manip levels of rupees
so that's where my order got held up at
i'll never order from Malo Express again
there's a guarnateed arrow drop in the alley by that one boko near the house
until you need rupee, then only arrow
ilia is supposed to be a major character yet restoring her memory is not mandatory
I think it's the other side
you do have to restore it
you do get the sky book though because you need it for the horse call
but that is in your inventory forever
just imagining how hated TP would be if you had to do this part without fast travel
it's much more enjoyable in glundo since you're doing stuff along the skybook
you even do cave of ordeals in the middle of it
Link: yo check out what i can do with my rod
we would need exactly 1 golden bug
what are the points of Ooccoos?
Did you pay your city taxes?
What is that little screen tho?
So which colosseum is your favorite?
i used to make Luke (my other brother) play this part for me because the hands made me anxious
Anyone here have a turkey they don't want?
i cant wait for my first run of this game to take 10hrs
Is this the best room in the game I see
@monado I'm gonna shove Patrick up your ass based on that comment
Look if I shove Mr krabs or SpongeBob it's just a guilty pleasure
I'll give you something to stare at Zeli, I promise I won't find it rude
Remind me to never learn glitchless if I get the itch
Glitchless is unironically a lot of fun
Can't do it if I don't run it
If I tell you its Pikmin I'd be lying to you
And I don't think you want that
Then I find it rude SirMad
I do have some good news for you Zeli
You can't fix this with an emote of cute Pikmin
what if I told you there's news of more Pikmin emotes being made
I'd say you tell me a lot of things and only some have been true
Most is a subset of some
Learning Palace isn't too bad tbf
If you learn stuff in Palace
You get it over with faster
I could also go drink some milk
It better have milk and not water
You could also play some Pikmin, but you won't
I'm gonna get my cereal (if you thought I was gonna say cum I'm judging you you degenerate pig Stare )
Holy shit, feels like you just had her
link open the door please can we not fight anymore
how the hell did that not hit
I swear to God and God knows, if you ask for proof about shoving a turkey up my ass I'll go up there and shove it up yours
what the Hell are y'all talking about in chat
Yeah well I didn't expect you'd actually be able to
Buff00n help me out of this I beg
They want Pic or didn't happen
GamesBot with the "Good luck" IMMEDIATELY after Phantom explains the bird going up someone's ass
Wouldn't be the first time a bot fucks me over
Or on this platform for that matter
I mean, you've threatened to fuck yourself over, so
Oh it's not even close to the shit I do say when I'm unhinged
i dreamt that i watched a documentary about a guy who had a fetish of shoving things up his colon
SwiftPichu_: Wouldn't be the first time a bot fucks
@stalkor if it was lasagna that was swiftpikachu_
chat, would YOU fuck a robot ?
Head is head, regardless of the source
we're on the same page, then
@buff00n yes but only in the communication port
do i get a spoon and eat chocolate icecream out of the container
i think its a Pennsylvania thing
I was attempting some Mario Party 9 solo mode for a sub 2:40 time
and errr, the run was absolutely apocalyptic
we're waiting to see if Swift has to stuff a turkey up their ass
I do not think I could’ve had a slower win on the last 3 boards
he really kicked that ball back at you
I genuinely wonder how mathematically improbable that run was
Get down from there Zelda monadoA
cant wait for the ER convo: “hi. whats the problem?” swift:”i stuffed a turkey” ER:”ok…then why are you here” Swift:”well….”
they must be cool ranch flavored
did you just say Cool Ranch is bad ?
I haven't even had cool ranch so no debate from me here
Yeah México doesn't have the same variety in snacks
No phantom tequila isn't a snack
But most of mexico's snacks is unironically insects
You're not fucking Ganondorf, Ganondorf is fucking you
I don't know the inside out of horseback dorf, most I know I hold up right KEKW
Too many swifts and swiftalu for me is the real swift
DARK LORD OBLITERATED BY BLUE TWINK
I'll send you a rotisserie Chicken
imagine being a red head and a twink.
I trust you'll figure out the rest
You cheap bitch at least give me a good turkey
it's $5 chicken, nice and juicy
You can watch glub when it's out from gdq
It was closer to 45, but yeah needed to squeeze the donos as usual
should have put on the iron boots
And why do I have a feeling ano has a time
Not as bad of a time, those used to he old hundo times
thank god. the fishing here is so non existent
Now if you turn over to oot, they have hylian loach rta
Yeah but this game is more serious than oot
They don't call extensions meme categories for nothing
I love staring at a rupee for like 13 hours
Yeah because ano is the only one I know who has done low transforms
low% you mean sit and stare at a rupie%
To be fair low% seems good for a subathon
Or other shit while it's going
Swiftike did a run a few years ago
doesnt low% have that 3 hour wait?
Ike did a low% run which was basically him losing at Mario kart
I've a feeling you'd like glundo more than this
i've already thought about doing glundo because it looks fun
i guess it would depend on whats faster
Low% in pape I feel there needs to be a warp or something
Did your bot just say yes but also no
so then what if you get bow.
I am, SO bloody tired, outta nowhere
I got someone doing yu gi oh if you want
did Link go to find a way home to his redhead gf ?
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your weekend
I will not shove anything up my ass
Yoy! phanto274Wave phanto274Smile  and phanto274GL trying for a phanto274Gold
I love this music so much musica23Mvgdance
Brings back a ton of memories
btw phantom what do you use for your on screen chat
I might give that a shot as well. not super happy with what I'm currently using for onscreen chat
do you just remember what stats you need for it to be a range?
or do you have a tool that tells you that?
that may be the last part of this run that is good
he's not slow, he's just living life at his own pace
that's why his hidden power is ice, because it doesn't move fast enough to heat up to any reasonable amount
and just like that I already have SGDQ week off
Oh I get it. Because the move is confusion
a modest quilava moseying his way through orre
wow a modest Quilava in this day and age? what a world
thansk for the hoothoot rand amish
I do what I can *tips hat*
Okay Quilava what are you doing
i mean i'd expect nothing lese with that speed IV
But you don't have FW so idk
terriermon should be on the bed peache114Angy
You know what, I take what I said back
Im good, I redeemed for someone to play prime 1 rando. I let them roll it and it was god awful LUL
Why do you catch the Meditite?
waow we have an espeon and quilava tracker so i don't even have to ask
The umbreon remains a mystery tho
Can’t crit it it’s in the ball EZ
I missed an if in there but I’m sure it makes sense
How many x specials do you typically use in a run?
"I'll take your entire stock" intensities
Memir B and his Ludicolo squad
They be dancing in the rain so casually.
duking was told about leg day once, but what are legs if not lower arms, so he worked out his arms more
When your arms hang that low they’re legs
mark literally just told me I wasn’t allowed to take this game when I took the Wii today
Ay, you got my name right first try!
Oh so he talks about me does he lmao
That Espeon’s defense was looking a bit too high
@Sanaerys_ i talk about you on stream when i talk to you does that count
I need to go finish setting up my splits for tp glitchless
@TheGlubbers I don't know, I was just being stupid- I mean funny
@TheGlubbers ty ty, it's the depression /jk
So Rash is guaranteed no matter what IV you are
that hitmontop is angry cause he wishes that when he looked up he saw sky
I’ll be lurking. Lai made dinner, and I’m about to go into a food coma
She made fried chicken and potatoes
im leaving to meet variety for dinner in lunder 30 min
going to uvil at 5pm is gonna suck KEKW
I gotta speedrun the moment I get home. Gotta setup GDQ OBS so I can do comms for tgh the 16th lmao
I love Typhlosion! No worries, Phantom. This Typh won'tlet you down. <3
I get home at 6pm, and my appointment is for 8:45pm LMAO
that's still super easy tho ice
like comms obs is trivially fast you could get home at 8:40 and be fine KEKW
I also gotta make sure Windows 11 didn’t fuck me in the ass while I was gone
Don't look at the two missed crits and the nature.
it's funny i see the arena and immediately know "mt battle" cause maddy doing attempts at it in XD lol
Bot has been on fire lately
@lordofduh Hey thanks! I appreciate it! <3
I forgot this trainer has multiple Trapinches?!?
If you pb I'll shove my cigarette up my ass and draw a stache on my ass
Thank you! It was last Friday. PartyHat
That's why I'm confidently saying stupid shit
I'll worry once you're around venus
If you pb, I’ll also shove a cigarette up Pichus ass and draw another mustache
Ice I'm gonna draw a fucking penis in your ass
I've said turkey, finger, pencil, pen, I think cat at some point
Anything is possible with a little commitment
Phantom you’re missing out on this dinner
I think I’ve moaned like 5 times eating this chicken and potatoes
OK so Lai is the man swifNotes
After dinner like this, Lai can be whatever she wants
why's my cat so damn touch-starved
Oh hey there's the cat I shoved up my ass
Did you not dig the houndour?
If you have a slimmer thing of respect towards me I hope you read nothing KEKW
I hated this fucking trainer for so long
I won't address pikaclones as the goat
That is the fastest fight I have ever seen
Just cause it takes 2 turns and it took 1
I wonder if hundo ever uses umbreon
want to hear my favorite dumb orre-related factoid
@swiftpichu_ probably not bu no snags does
I'm just big plusle fan lmao
if you purify the roselia from XD and transfer it to another game you can give a seel a kiss from a roselia
Being alive in a Colo run is a blessing
fave guy is beaten on pace?
cause that's the only way for roselia to learn sweet kiss
That strat is slow but is such a good backup for stuff like this
We love plusle in this house
tippiLurk phanto274Lurk rhacodLurk while having dinner
I see my personal nightmare so ty for pointing
Love this game hope runs going good natsunamiRave2
All part of the plusle experience
I've liked minun more than plusle
Fun fact no matter what iv/nat combo that plusle is it will always outspeed, because those geodudes have 19 speed lol
What about the old man who used pikachu he was pretty rad lol
Give the old folks a breaks
I'm waiting for phantom to get the Pikachu win
Plot armor pikachu is always clippable
Hell yeah, losing to Venus. that’s the spirit
You gotta pb for pichus sake
There’s a cigarette on the line
Ice I swear to God I'm gonna stick my finger so deep it's gonna look like I have you as my puppet
You'd need more than a finger if you're promising that, Pichu
Just know that I’m drinking 2 gallons of milk the day before
I'm afraid a whole fist is just kink
And I am very lactose intolerant
It's fine I'll eat taco bell
what are y'all threatening each other with in chat
I really hope you PB so you submit this run with this chat
I think Ryz's notes have backup for if catty dies, but my notes should have it too
Swift let phantom's run die, please KEKW
Wait are you doing fast banette?
psychic blaze kicked in there Pog
Or it might be for lab death idr, but they weren't when I last used them
That's the spirit! Keep the run alive!
I even have a bunch of safety stuff in play as those notes are meant for safety
Yea you might want my notes then
If you hate being safe I also have a version that's got no safety stuff
Do what all of us do, just play Pokemon Unite
Pokemon Lets go and unite are so dope
Ice, that's a MARGAINLY worse idea
Of course Buff, but hear me out
Open some packs in Pocket phanto274Smile
I like watching a friend be toxic in Unite, but I don't do team games
Rider Nelis, the streets are curious about what you be riding?
this thing has been Fire Blasting too well Susge
Back to the lab again isolar2Catjam
big dumb idiots don’t know you have protect
Oh you are doing lab death
Maybe I should write notes, I like using Zeke notes but they have 0 hand holding (Which is fine for me tbh)
I did not cause I assumed you'd go for maku catch no lab death
Ok maybe I do consider writing notes then
done with dinner and we dont do safe
I just like how I write notes better (I am biased)
and that's still the safer pape run
I will shrimply write lab death note
I will shrimply make it speed guides live compatible 🤌
Yea tho I assume it doesn't translate the exact same as google sheets where I used ~pretty colors~
Oh the double protect I like that one
Might have found out another thing I may need to edit/check with the damage formula woo hoo!
It's that I realized it's type1x type2 and not (type1 x type2)
love how they used the 64 models here
Anyways yea so in the formula rather than being in parathensis it's just multiplied with everything else which can matter if your number ends up being a decimal
Beat Venus at a hefty cost of time
It would be off by 1-2 at most
There's a heal machine down when you walk towards venus yea
I have no idea wat Rhydon is about to do
But you're probably right it probably does toxic, just like crobat protects
It all comes down to this
20 levels under wil do that
This run is in shambles now.
I can do damage formula stuff I got you
Don't trust showdown I've learned lol
I had a disagreement with showdown on a calc yesterday and I was right
Oh you know what there was a heracross fight that had 0 iv set
I think it might be this one
There should be stats on the side too
Oh fuck yes I don't have to lube up the cig
Odd I'm getting the same stats for 0 iv neutral heracross
you can't just ask that of a streamer
You be nerds, I'll watch football
Also make sure it's set to Advance generation
I'm watching rams vs vikings bitch
If not then fate doesn't want you
also what are we nerding about, I'll take that any day over american football aka Spend More Time Between Plays Than Actual Action
Or hear me out, you can burn rng while doing laundry
The short of it is you got a bulky heracross but also yea the sheet misguided hard
That is the only one I know of yes
I did copy the data over it was pointed out before long ago so I’ll fix it
Hope the RNG is with us this time
Most optimal run: Always hit fire blast, don't get KO'd. EZ
I am the devil's advocate yes
had to pop out for a bit, how did the run die? Make it to Realgam Coliseum?
Pray for good RNG idk lol
Damn that’s wild it kept trucking
I saw Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare tonight
All we are missing is the Water/Ghost starter
Since there's no starter with that combination yet
Man, even speedrunning Colloseum is difficult
I watched a video of someone getting every shadow shiny with RNG manips and I thought, “Speedrun maniping doesn’t look too bad right now”
Trying to think of my favorite Pokémon from every region
Either Spheal or Sceptile for 3
phanto274GG got a decent run off the ground at least
GL on your runs Phantom phanto274GL
phantom is always good and awsm orange a great member.
I shared it in #suggestions today
also icebound said everdrive pape is possible, it will just take time
im just glad to know it can be done
pape rando discord is doing a pape only AP async, we have 8 people lol
I learned today with dk64r there is a tracker that can display the song playing if its a dev branch seed
peache114Yawn  guess who just crawled out of bed
im living  in shame axl leave me be
RNG on your side tonight with that pull
I’m going to attempt it again tonight lol
I need to look at Glubs video again cuz it wasn’t clicking
Yeah I just need to stand in the same spot then figure out the visual cue from there
satellite u sacrifice a panel of ur or opponents
and it gattling guns 2 boxes ahead
During your time did you work on any projects that got leaked
I was watching Kit and Krysta talk about their experience so was curious
the soundtrack is a banger NODDERS
school comp goes way too hard
how much damg does it do? 15?
youll save time if you draw it on iceman
ive seen dalus do it a few times
lmao im not really listening more lurking bcuz im working on  vods and all i hear is "when you go shopping with a girl and she wont shut up"lmao
do you run faster when running against the walls?
why is it called power plant when it's not plant power
ALL UR BASE R BELONG TO US
Darn it was a great one
Doing AP with pape, how do i turn on auto tracker?
gotcha ill just do it manually then no worries
if you pb I'll shove my UI goku funko up my ass
Looks like I'll be in vegas again in the summer lol
Evo is doing official side-games with full medals and shit and kof was announced first
I'm planning it out with mn friends rn
Also top 8 is back thank god
battle network chads who up for some late night gaming
Don't worry woman also walk away from me
Maybe the game thinks you do
Glad you enjoyed the vomit formula in sheets sixeTada
I should probably consider getting a job doing excel sheets lmfao
I love making stuff like that so yes I would
Hopefully no terrible game bugs to prevent a phanto274Gold
Ayo, gl hf on the run(s)!
Haven't got any yet, but good to know
Done with duties time to enjoy a stream
Capcom's favorite BN character is Mr. Match LUL
Isn't there, like, some kind of super niche competitive scene for some of the BN games?
is that based on the actual charracter or the just the design?
BN6 has an online scene, they found a way to play online thanks to the GBA wireless adapter
hello escape, nice to see you this encounter
ermm... i meant to say "BN3 Resetter" KEKW
but yeah i used to watch symes
Ive been around, hell ive been following erothaur and kilios for over 10 years
Yo what's up man (of mega)?
an RNG manip in a battle network is precise?!? no way i don't believe that at all
If you pb I will shove mirby up my ass
KEKW i come back to that message
We're a veeeery long way from having a beef
spare a chat member a subspace emissary run in the future?
BN is the best game man. Never gets old.
Don't threaten me with a good time
I'm an x/zero fan and I hate BN
Motherfucker do you not remember my first BN game was network transmission?
I'm not an X fan, but I am a MMZ fan
I'm sorry I take it back
It is cool, but it's extremely fucking jank
twas ok, tho i died all my runs lmao
hes playing jp version so no lmao
@peachedpocky I know, but let me dream
Alright, imma head out though. Goodluck with the MegaMan Battle Network 532 run calami29Boingus3
I ask myself that question everyday, for 23 years.
Or even worse, a degen psychic
think you meant to spell psycho
If I was a psycho I wouldn't be here
One thing is talking shit and another doing shit
Yes that’s right it was all my luck
Why not start with the first game though lol
Start with 2 and play 1 later, or just skip 1?
Why is that dude passed out LMAO
he was just laying on the road
I have to run my laundry is done lol. Good luck with the rest phanto274Smile
Spaghetti I havent eaten in 2 months
Yeah but I just got back and needed to express myself
Probably sit in vc later tonight or tomorrow so we can talk about this run
i always giggle when you kill one of them as they move cause the smear sprite
i did my first timed segemt of tp
yeah i got to faron twilight at 31:46
Great 1st hr but alas din time gonna phanto274Lurk tippiLurk rhacodLurk
you should play a non-rng game like colosseum :)
just get the right frame 1st try
also i just saw that message you sent do all friends :)
surely they got 7 hours to spare
i found it funny you got 2 escapes in battle 2
like it really wanted you to get out
"even we know this encounter is trash, go on, get out of here"
i was actually gonna suggest myth KEKW
you played tales of graces f at all?
the remastered is out today been having fun re playing it
Hey Phantom, did you know 0.01 CAD equals 0.069 USD? isnt that so nice?
i couldve just said 7 cents yeah but this is funnier
I accidentally clicked on the stream and had my phone in my lap
We all hate BN1, welcome to the club
it have 1 of the best combat system people have said they don't like the story but i like the story
and suddenly heard voices talking about the 0.069 American cents, and axelhad JUST finished messaging me abt jt
so I thought I was hearing shit
al I know is vesperia is one of the better ones, never played it tho... this is the xbox 360 exclusive right?
vesperia combat is good but i think the game sucks
@Axl_SR ps3 in jp only also then ps4 and pc switch too i think
Xillia 1 is what got me into tales
I like graces f a lot too
or just get the ps5 version of graces
I have graces f ps3 physical
funny thing is you get the grade shop right away and its max out you can start with anything on if you want
I heard what digital foundry said
Ttyd remake is bad for speedruns too. But i still feel it's a good remake otherwise
i got returns just so I can play it on arcade stick like I did with tropical freeze
just a fun silly way to revisit
@iceblue My new audio technia headphones are limited edition ice blue LUL
Hideki Kamiya saying Switch 2 leakers need to be destroyed is so real
are we gonna find fast guage in the bed comp again?
ice, its the same as bn2 style skip if you're aware of that one too
I just got here to open the folder cloae the folder open the folder open the folder
can't you not jack out in power plant?
did you see how jugoombas bn5 runs went today?
All I caught was reset on knightman fight cause no drilarm1
and what do those get you
there is a free backup in scilab comp
then you do the Chip Gate ASE instead Kappa
the best way for ice to learn this is to run it himself KEKW
I don't know how it works, only that the result is you flip the bits for the complete flags to unlock gold duo
I still don't have them all in this game
we gonna see the TalkToDesk manip?
lemme guess, you only get $2.50 of it still
Ice, did you know Ms. Mari has a twin sister? So if you left her kidnapped no one would ever know LUL
so chips are more likely to appear in their original spot
Every 64 in game steps there is an encounter check, the first few hundred steps the chance is 0%, then every other encounter check it increases 3% > 6% > 9% until around 45% or 49%, then its just a matter of how many coin flips you win.
I find 43 funnier than 69 LUL
Smog made an alphabet soup emote LUL
if only Escape J+K+L was a PA
you escape but also get a reward
you escape and then turn off encounters until you jack out
not true, you go to school to use the subway Keepo
oh hell fuckin yeah ice, you already know
these fish guys have hype animations
If you pb I'll shove this fish so deep up my ass I'll float
oy that the nerd i was just chatting with in discord :P
it's okay he had his music
also i find it funny that the anime makes the kid an entire unique character and part of the group
why is it called water comp when we're not compensated for it
elec man scenario music goes crazy hard
that or the battle theme might be my favorite songs in this game
the game also cuts the encounter rate
they coded in to turn you at corners, so they clearly thought of it
it was L, you could've picked it
i tuned out after you beat up a scotsman in the oven sorry
i could read if you weren't skipping all the cutscenes
you also can't charge at all without charge 2
i still want to cosplay her at some point
just need to lose weight lol
FireMan in the dub got renamed TorchMan too lol
What is Ices knowledge of this and who is in the lead?
ice's knowledge of this run is "wow the sequel's run is better"
ice don't do that to yourself, not even at my low this morning would i be willing to torture myself that much
in the anime masa had a secret identity as leader of a crimefighting trio (with sal and miyu). his name? COMMANDER BEEF
hold on i have live footage of ice right now
the funniest part is it's perfectly in time with the BGM
i gift a sub to myself
i wanted to even out my bits lmho
Pride1 one gay bit to even mine out
v0oid has his effects all set to 69 bits so i was uneven lol
Twitch presents real american heroes. Today we salute you Mr Battle Network Speedrunner Guy. Without you we would be forced to do the unthinkable... playing BN1 ourselves. But you can finish it in under 2 hours. On with your god awful RNG you battle bad boss RNG, not drawing Escape chips, and failing polar bear skip. And why do you do it? No really, why would you play BN1? Regardless, we tip our hat Cheer100
there is a glitch to this fight, not sure how it works but protoman takes damage everytime he steps lol
is that just hitting him with spark
oh, you need clues to find WWW Area in the undernet, this leads to to Higsby memo, teacher memo, and pa memo
i like to think that those stops are still there but lan never needs to go there so he doesn't
but it's also funny to just imagine the trans were moved entirely to new lines
yeah, M-Cannon can take out the life virus aura. Good Idea
lie down. try not to cry. cry a lot.
wait, the WWW Door chip is just something you can get off an enemy?
maddy said "What?!? Guts being useful for something?!?!? BLASPHEMY"
you should head into internet 10+ for chips Kappa
invis is one of the best chip in the series
now you can redo the trader
you can even save scum it
pretty sure you can buy D Barriers at most drug stores
YO IS THIS MY FAVORITE SPORT FOOTBOMB?!?
this is the run of all time
are you comparing to sum of worst now lol
that was rough, i see why he's the final boss
Endgame and just in time about to popesTreat tippiEAT TreatCorn
GGs on the 36 minute pb
Hey Phantom! Hope you are doing well today
Too famous for your own good lol
i mean lets be honest here
when you click the RANDOMIZE button that's all it takes to ask for that
starting without boots is really fun to watch
What would be amazing is early boots
take it from me, someone who had ocarina on adult fishing in the ZOOTR she just did, and had required golden gauntlets cause she forgot to turn off trials and found out they were behind talon cucco game where the weird egg was in hyrule castle fairy fountain
although that seed also had the hilarity of having medallions set to anywhere and yet having shadow medallion be FULLY VANILLA
lordofduh called the early Kooper too
I look away for 5 seconds. I didn't even notice they got Kooper
hello I hope you are well
when do you do hotfix? I’m sure have said but I haven’t been around much lately been pretty busy
I didn’t realize when puzzles are randomized the colored boxes in the toy box are too. 😂 I have to write it down because it’s so long
Yes back in time and seems pape bonus content
there's no ice potato on me
the most precious coin in all starborn valley
I got 2 quarters in my car door
guess you need to leave traps on
my twin sister thinks it’s entertaining
I like traps. lots of instant gratification turned to rage quickly
that’s the worst it’s happened to me so many times
when is gdq hotfix? gotta make sure I tune in for support :)
I'd also tell you to fuck off
I'll join vc and you can listen to me snore and fart
yeah ill be there for support for sure friend
and gets the quake badge lol
ask for quake and you shall receive
When you get a chance after stream go post in my discord AP channel
thanks for the pie. I mean bomb
love the fuecocco plush and the plush next to him i think its an octorok
is there ever a point to d down pound
So. I can't help but point out a confusing element
Why do you need to test the rando settings before hotfix when you just hotfix them at hotfix?
Just hotfix a good end time 4Head
im thinking goombario might be here
there's still a fair amount of checks out there to get anyway
just got done yapping about all masks on hotfix which was fun
what kind of estimate are you aiming for
shame shas had to call in a substitute host but glad you had fun
it was, i played axl's reqiest game
you are cool, you are rad, and you make fun content raid
Love the skin, can you believe smash ultimate took away fire mario
i told them to say that you are cool and make good content, but thanks axl for just spelling that out
You're gonna be on GDQ? That's dope af!
hes been there a few times, he did an event a few months ago w tp rando and glubbers
right right pax, i cant differentiate events
that race was great, I took a screen cap. One of you was on final and the other was on Bowser??? witth he caption "this is such a close race" LUL
I remember you doing pokepark, based game
GaySex GaySex2 Looking why is this a emote
its always really cool to have a dev on the couch
are you doing the dumb laki trick?
speaking of Tubba's Castle key @Axl_SR
oh right @lordofduh the stream is done so ill hop in rando VC channel
the guys are waiting on my AP items LUL
im gonna lurk and grab more iced tea
oh joy where was the goomba
you don't need that many repel gels? bold call Mr 5 HP Kappa
life shrooms don't grow on trees, but apparently on bushes :o
he didn't intend to, but ended up skinny dipping
so for christmas i got a pokemon cookbook and there's a recipe for shuckle berry juice
i just ordered a milkshake from cold stone and basically just did that recipe as the milkshake lol
the recipe calls for vanilla yogurt with banana, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries with pomegranate juice. couldn't get the last bit but i just got the rest (with vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt)
yeah it's a basic smoothie mix lol. it is also tasty indeed
also i did submit a small logic update over github
easy fix, train station bushes only show in logic with bombette
I noticed during my AP this week lol
im go mode now, icebound is waiting on my koot stuff but im rushing for final now lol
WHY CAN I BLOCK CRYSTAL BITS ON BIZHAWK BUT NOT ON HARDWARE!?!?
still no tubba bubba castle key?
what are the chances of that?
don't think it's part of the rando algo to troll the runner
i have broke logic in the archi im doing so much that im beating my game in about 15mins
i dont have my light arrows
I just got a 7 cap on hallway starting at 8 dmg
got phase 1 to 69 LUL
um no cant say i have
well shit that a lot of damage
nah, I said no to GDQ lol
Brother we all know that's wishful thinking
phanto274GL on finding the ideal settings
So what was added to try and get it to the ideal length
ahhh god content hello how are doing
ist thiis new setting blitz or just a rando
what do you have on is i can ask
so basically what you were doing before but without the beta stuff you added?
your last run on gtq was have startet with suchie glich
An 🍎 a day keeps the Juniors away
what do you think mirrow mod on gtq ?
just mirror your x axis too and it's the exact same as normal :P
on the first chapter of the run woud be funny in gta is mario cant do nothing my opinient littel bit enoing but funny
i just pry of a good seed
I found you're stuff on YT the other day for the Nightmare random I just finished that a few hours ago
General Guy fused with Argorok to make a flying tank
That's I'm shoving a seed up my ass to see if I a tree can grow up
All you need in life is bitches
So how about that airline food
why do i have never think aboud that just just laki
the blocks on beach are not rando?
we have out of logig boots
hmm, so i haven't been getting emails saying you've started streaming. will unfollowing and refollowing fix that?
nop that what we dont whant
yep thats all turned on, just haven't been getting notfied at all
but i got axl's notification so i dunno
i ahve persenaly erverthing mutet dc or anithing but i guss for the gtq run i mayby wanna aktivate then
geez that top bar color is something else. gl hf o7
i go to beat lurk of phone gn
It's just for Koopa Bros actually
i mean gerneral guy was posebil but a littel bit rng
Because they can be literally unkillable
What's Rowf set to? All 5 sets?
what when are bots on mout rugget
For Chan it's Boots, Goombario, Sushie, or Watt. I suppose we could add Laki, but I think currently it's kind of like throwing a bone in regards to battle logic
Kind of brutal if you ask me
That's why I wanted to add at least Watt to GG logic, but everyone was like "let's not be too hasty here"
Right. But I think the KBF boss is the only one that's in any way likely to be that early, right?
Did you include the bombette skip for the toybox wall pre GG?
Haven't had time to look over the PR besides taking a glance
tho I noticed the bombette puzzle skip change is incorrect. Not sure if a fix before after sunday is a good idea because it's a weird edge case
Missed the start where you probably mentioned this, did you add longer BC?
Aight, curious what the time is going to be
I mean she's been in the box without refrigeration for over one hour
I dip my balls in the Burger King soda dispenser. if that offends you then you can leave this country, snowflake.
y'all were supposed to copy and paste that
my brain was so confused by this music lol
I dip my balls in the Burger King soda dispenser. if that offends you then you can leave this country, snowflake.
burger king is already gross enough
potentially, but i have to die by my slander of BK
i've had it one singular time
and i will never eat there again
the last time i had BK it was just the most digusting burger i've had
so even though i used to enjoy it i just can't anymore
i was linked to a online tool that lets you spin the world map in like all the different types of projections and i turned africa into a potato
yeah i don't think i've ever been to burger king without a catastrophic event following it
are you not gonna deliver that mail?
parakarry is going to lose his job
My moms Eagles are going to the champ game. Now its the ravens turn. GLHF on the rando madness.
iirc the koopa tower is technically still bowser, but the koopas separated are their own enemies
you found the chef of bowser's castle
if you leave now you might just starve them out
I saw a group of ants today. I saw a fucking group of ants today. And these ants were just doing their fucking thing. Ants. Ants? This lowly form of creation, ants? Ants? Do you know how ants do their thing? Do you know what it is to be an ant and do your thing? You fucking work. All day. All night. 24 hours a motherfucking day. Ants. All they know is work, that's what they exist for. The queen fucking ant, queen bee, whatever, she needs a fucking lair. Well it's time to get to work ant boys! Le
phanto274Nom ghunzoNom rhacodNom NomNom time so will be tippiLurk phanto274Lurk rhacodLurk then.
for the record that was hilarious
also i am back from finally doing a long-delayed self-care
I saw a group of ants today. I saw a fucking group of ants today. And these ants were just doing their fucking thing. Ants. Ants? This lowly form of creation, ants? Ants?

I haven't been here, what kind of settings are these?
i've always loved that this glitch makes you go "oh no junior troopa's frozen in ice! anyways"
the legendary scarf of true power
so today, because of retroachievements, i learned there's a one piece tactical RPG on original gameboy
Oh this blooper is last, huh
but still, of all genres on all systems
Go mode! (Assuming you can clear Bowser's Castle)
Should be a fairly quick endgame then
Checking the panel but not the block smh
I guess power badges were cheap?
we just don't need your go mode item in the middle of the fucking desert again
also these settings were terrible they led you to getting goombario
oh good I can actually chat now
My twitch hasn't been letting me chat for 2 hours lol
2 sets of shoes in Toad town
It's because Watt bled onto the hud
Hammer or bombette would open this seed up
Funny option would be feesh for something under a panel
What the fuck is that following you
the random BP needed for badges, I'm guessing it's a range like 0-3 more/less than vanilla and not completely random, right?
sounds like what you're saying is that randos are so random
I was just making a cringe joke
it was good, we did a lil weekly race together
with drak, levias and axl. 7 chapter, dungeon/boss rando
how's the settings for this one?
This one fuzzy will be it's new name
Bow was half off on a different shop
the idea of Bow realizing she can be bought for cheap LUL
That upgrade reminding you of a shiny new pair of shoes
what a good trick to join the stream to lmao
runs of what? nah i'm kinda of out of the loop ngl
i never could do this trick period
hitting 1s and then a 10
yo phantom! I won the race
also everdrive has arrived in my state. Did you X7 come with usb cable?
and someone else already got the SRC page so i can actually just enjoy learning to run the game instead pf stressing routing it
What's the estimate gunna be when you do the run?
whelp my Ravens 🐦‍⬛ ended 🆙 losing but enjoyed a snow ❄️y bike 🚲 ride out. how goes the finds so far? Oh a 🆕 seed.
love the closing of the eyes just then
Just to look fancy or use as a head wrap
you took the star piece from the quiz guy but not the from the tree
Bucket and scarf in the desert
will we find the goomba lord
i really hope you have to do this for the gdq seed
If only the dusty hammer could be used as a one use hammer
One use as in it'll break after and you have to go rebuy it
so far an upgrade melody and a ruins key ouch
yes on thursday so just grinding away!
i used to have wr but now i'm 4th. 2nd and 3rd have mid to low 1:13's and wr is a high 1:12
i want to get a mid 1:12 and then asses to see if I wanna do the 1:11 grind which would be about 1.5 mins from sob
yo have fun i'm gonna get my dinner that's been waiting monkaS
Maybe the hammer you're looking for is on snowman's gift...
He was here last time too
Just one position to the right
The million dollar question this seed "Does Merlow have a phanto274Ban ?"
Nah it's fine, train is here
Sadge only if  farore's wind setting was pubilc
this is so fun to watch :)
hammer behind anti guy would be funny
getting boo's portrait can't compare to this
it's not a fish, it's a mammal Kappa
rogueport news hear how does it feel to be a mario without a hammer?
At this rate it's more and more likely that Merlow had it
100+ checks surely a hammer will be one
hmm purple fire pink camo cool
i am sooo tired have fun papey sparkleYawn sparkleYawn
YES i am a mmbn enjoyer!!!!!
not enjoying MMBN makes you a bum
yeah that event we gotta be a little more less ... kinky on main LUL
i don't think helix wants us to talk about that LMFAO
@Iceblue I'm not hearing you CAN'T be freaky on main, tho
If we wanna be invited back
How much to fight Amazee Dayzee
Don't you mean vanilla Crystal King?
sorry ive been lurking and saw you got up to this boss lol
This seed has one hell of a twist when it came to the hammers
Guess where the last hammer is
Spear Guy could have lived but instead chose the afterlife by Stone hammer
only 3 screens away, bro could’ve done something
Here take this shooting star and go rescue your child yourself
he’s a yoshi, couldn’t he have eaten the m bush or something
all that for a sfx badge lol
also this seems like a fun seed
Guess where the final hammer is?
For all those who just joined us
I just guessed on those lol
I've got the stream on 5% volume yet Raven STILL hears my audio
those 1 coins are just the bee's knees huh
time to glitch into blueberry patch
I can do a few glitches but not all of them some are very hard to do
Rosie actually has something of value today
my birthday is 2 days away
you can just barely see the outline of the walk way in the dark but I can see it.
"didnt see this guy" in pitch black lol
but that is really cool you can do that without using watt
How to easily beat a Paper Mario boss: Shredder Strats
mario can walk on water it’s a miracle!
It's only been 7.5 hours and the average working day is 8-12 YEP
Just get a ✂️ and it's auto-win vs all of PapeMario
Then again Paper Mario defeated a pair of scissors
Paper Mario is the paper that beats scissors
@jc________________ then that means rock beats paper
I can’t wait to see that
ive been lurking for a while
i was doing a rando with 110 power stars but i was missing 10
goombas and koopas being the same color makes that worse
I haven’t done power stars yet. I figured when I got better that would be the time to try it.
Just use aim bot and then you can't miss
part of my concern is that the spoiler log seemed to suggest bowsers castle had power stars but I couldn't get there without all 120
um I didn’t know that’s how you did that. I thought you stood on the middle and just let bombette fall but that makes way more sense
i remember needing the last pair of boots in a jail cell in order to have the height to hit the ? blocks in the sewer
This one is a real stinker
The worst item in the game
“Where’s the key?” right fucking there I guess
that's where the key was? was it your run where the tubba blubba key was vanilla some days ago?
French vanilla in the worst way
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Today will be Chinese dim sum for me for dinner
Just had my bi-annual teeth cleaning
It's going to be 7 bp
Your pathing shorts have been really helpful btw
When I left you yesterday no hammer and still no hammer
Doesn't this combination also get you to ch5?
i just got back from running an errand. Found a USB micro, hoping thats the right one for the X7
i beat the pot centipede and got you a bubbleman chip. i'm sorry :P
did you just bomb the block and get a badge
oh i was ages behind lmfao
i was wondering if bombing blocks works in vanilla lmao
Goombario came packaged with an upgrade
just never thought to try that as a kid lmfao
Lemme know if you want jcog and me to watch out for backtracks this bad during the seed vetting
I only watched the first hour of the second run from yesterday. But I peeked the finish time, and oof
Okay, so we're looking for something not sub 3:30, but also something not completely terrible...
Super early general guy with nothing
We might need backtracking though to get anywhere near 4hrs
Early to mid game BC is the way to go probably
oh. Yeah that's awful in almost any settings
Anywho, gotta bounce, gl on the rest. Also pls send me the spoiler logs for the past 2 or 3 seeds if you still have em
Hammer does the same as Jump x1 so Jump was always better
Again berserkers aren't known for brain capacity and instead watch weapon go smash
Now we don't have to use the awkward way into 7
Doesn't help that in this case you couldn't get rid of the Tuff Puffs easily with partner
i mean.. games done quick, its in the name
Nice nice. Will definitely try to catch the hotfix. I'm glad PMR is gonna get some attention
dungeon and boss rando for pm is seems super interesting
mario: heals all the time enemy: heals at all (hes cheating)
Oh I just noticed the different bosses on the tracker, that's cool
Just finished the meat sauce and linguini and lookin pretty solid on ur finds
yeah i got it for about that much when i snagged it, friend showed me a sale that knocked it down that much lol
If it was a Watt star though
Just learned paradox pokemon in the anime just make sounds and dont actual say their names. Truly the unga bunga of pokemon anime language. Cheer100
guzzlord just screams, so its basically Goku LUL
you have mods, put there asses to work
Im telling Rigby I want your hotfix settings to be season 4 LUL
i heard something about a mod? need something
I never laughed so hard at a single emote use
id imagine youd have a better time find clean japanese audio than english
yeah I was gonna say I'm sure someone's ripped the game audio at some point
maybe not for the modern ones but certainly for the older ones.
of right, pokemon cries! My dumbass is thinking the anime cause thats what I mentioned first
Probably your favorite mons and mons you use for speedruns
cant you just rip it from the fan made pokedex apps? The ones ive used have cries
Hence why the Espeon and Quilava cries
oh pokepark would be a good starting point'
there i finally found a funny one
progressive undernet rank in ariel's grotto
what are you doing with that ariel
Vanilla bowsers castle 3 times in a row
Looks like we need to make sure that doesn't happen for your run
Enjoy this music because it's stopping now
it wasn't even C O N T E N T bad
And now back to the vanilla speedrun of Paper Mario
like a bad seed can be redeemable if it's at least entertaining in how bad it is, this was not that lol
your splits analyzer seems to be more accurate about my resets
No wonder the child was imprisoned in the castle
this game is so good and fair
holy shit 5fp power bounce lmao
honestly yeah but seeing it drain 20fp in 4 turns feels wrong lol
you sure you have enough repel gels
dylanjGG phanto274GG rhacodGG popesPOGGERS tippiWin marcoWin
great end to a ravid seed
i think being idk 70 mins under is a problem
just in time gotta go to cheer on my buckeyes in the title game
Fuck ME, it's cold as HELL
hopefully not more than 4 either
this 1 is a 407 Kappa
i oneshot woodman with a fully charged atomic fire and he left 50 rupees for you in the pile of ashes that used to be him
streamer's too cool to homeward shroom
Still fuckin worthless of a character
man pretending hes not wearing boots just so he can jump on his friend
we can *see* the boots mario
someone whisper devs, get them on the barefoot mario start sprite
If we all did 5 dollars
37 people in chat, < 3 dollars each
the fact that your "dollars" is 10k bits LOL
"hi everyone, i brought a bomb!"
You're gonna shove nuts in bloopers mouth
Have you ever considered how blooper feels?
What was he doing with those
I was wondering where I left those
Sorry I was trying to dry them
and we got to see you throw nuts at blooper
You skipped like 5 on mountain
What if you put on slow go
I can contribute 883 bits towards the cause
what did that penguin do to you
why do you keep blowing him up
is not even ONE wall in this game save?
been trying out the Going Commando AP and good lord doing endgame planets with no armor is brutal cause rn everything is vanilla damage. phanto274Cry
hey - better that then random planet difficulty making early planets a nightmare
cus I mean - R&C games all have had new game + options, so like... KEKW
i wonder if you can NG+ the AP lmao
I bet you could, just that it would not be really helpful
like - unless you wanna do nanotech level sanity that is
cus I renember up your arsenal (thats the 3rd, yea? I always forget the names and go 3 cus over here it was 1, 2, 3 and then the title which I didnt memo from there) did have another 100 nanotech levels behind that
or hell - hear me out, something which could reasonably be added from NG+ stuff: higher bolt multiplier unlocks and weapon level based checks
and then Deadlocked was the 4th which was called Gladiator in EU iirc
only had 3 as a kid, thought the series was interesting, but cus I didnt have the money to even think buying into the PS eco, it always stayed an afterthought
but yeah lotsa stuff is locked behing NG+ in UYA
going commando also does have a couple more weapon level upgrades behind NG+, no?
i forget cause i never played GC much, ik UYA does and also the RYNO is locked behind it iirc.
If you pb I'll fist Jon
@SwiftPichu_ fuck you KEKW not open for business PrideLaugh
@SwiftPichu_ I KNOW that now swifSmug
That's what I get for being degen, jon is into butt stuffing
@SwiftPichu_ that I did not say KEKW
I just said that to your degen hypthetical, I aint open for business for you KEKW
Unironically me being me has indeed backfired on me
A guy already tried to flirt with me KEKW
I was already prepared for it to backfire on me anyways
As I also knew I was gonna be banned somewhere eventually
huff'n puff chose to be of the frost kind today is all
whaaat you dont want to buy the coin? BUT IT WAS FOR ONE COIN! KEKW
Oh yeah its party city tonite! Lookin pretty solid on items on the 2nd go around
I was hoping for charmy and the "hey you found a KEYY!" one tbh KEKW
so the story of this seed: mario has soggy feet
What item is behind star pieces?
can you toss Goombario in the trash as well
that was a lot of life shrooms
ya know... I shouldnt be surprised...
but somehow seeing new kinds of "fuck walls" moves in a videogame get me despite that tippiGiggle
cmon red luigi, get up there
the setups that take this long are evil
@buff00n only because the game said so this seed PrideLaugh
Just threaten to send him to Minish Cap
i am back from the gym
So it's hard to randomize Bowser's castle location huh
Since this is the fourth time that it's in the same place
how many things do ya need in bowsers to progress?
I did see parakarry, laki, bow - didnt play this in forever, so I dont know
Think all the partners minus Watt
ahh - ya still got a good ensemble of partners required for bowsers castle though I wanna guess
glitch logic, fair either way me brain thinkin "what if the dungeon randomization goes and is silly"
I swear, I hate this fucking keyboard man
again eating what I am typing out - had it eat entire words already....
guess rando's gonn rndo w castle placement then
"hey Peaches gues what! Twilight Princess is playable in AP" "Axl! You cant just come into my stream make me drop everything and not not help me test it!!" KEKW
it became playable a few days ago, needs more time in the oven
so..... why cant you beat it......?
fowl top chest had my super boots and it didnt send, had to manually send it
also you cant really change settings either
makes me renember how sunshines AP was there for a bit, then cus of a variety of issues between 🐬 and delfino plaza state nonsense were rough and the person behind it got busy IRL no one picked that up from there >.>
being rough - my brain forgot the sentence I was typing out mid typing it seems c.c
im not sure, github i see WritingHusky at the top of the page
the bottom mentions help from lunarsoap
meanwhile me out here specifically not playing MM in AP because of that...
so the map part of your trackerr will be dead due to new logic?
@Axl_SR it should work as long as phantom doesnt also update the pack to use the new logic
and then once thats done, it again will work *shrugs*
WritingHusky...is it a bunch of awoos
but emotracker doesnt auto hook to any rando out there to pull the logic from there straight up
as it is now I can do it just fine without a map, I just like the convence of being able to pin all the hints
I mean - that you'll still be able to do regardless, unless its a new location tippiThink
how deep is the ER rabbit hole opening up, if you heard any of that
super silly question, but: ooccoo nest or some such for the per dungeon ooccoos? swifDerp
I know OoT has C buttons in the pool. You cant use the button to play the ocarina until you find it
do you use simple 64 or retro?
oh yeah there is that to lol
thank you for letting me know good luck with your gdq run
We had that happen in the last seed
That is the seed that was bad
stupid in a good way or a bad way
And Bowser's Castle being vanilla 4 times in a row
The Espeon and Quilava reset simulator
To the point where their cries are now in your memories
