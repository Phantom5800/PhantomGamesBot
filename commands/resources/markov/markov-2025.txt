Yo haven't seen you since last year Kappa
check the write up I just did in #general
thankfully my N64 is working now
yeah i seen i was gonna say try cleaning it could be overheating
Ive never opened one before but could be worth a shot
hello. happy new year, best of luck on the run
Hii Phantom, happy new year and good luck phanto274Wave phanto274GL
it was good had some crazy luck on genshin so very happy
reset now before you go any further
so will this be glitchless or a normal speedrun?
So in Kazooie I just entered mad monster mansion, 100%'d all the previous worlds and IGT says 4:20 LUL
i was thinking my pc broke
guess i dont have to clip it
Happy New yr all! and yay a nice choice
did link die as a wolf permanently?
or is he now a growlithe?
awsm gambas and predictions will no longer have an effect on me.
It takes so long to look through the emote list to pick what one I want
maybe I'll just do this one
I finally dont feel like death
Shit's still draining so still mildly yucky feeling but I'm mostly over this cold
Starting soon more like starting right now
It looks good honestly if you hadn't said grape reduction I absolutely would said to call it that
If you said ayg reduction I would've produced tears
I block that part out of my mind
I'm flying back to Houston today before the polar vortex wipes me off the map
Teaching my niece in law to pronounce the days of the week
Indiana for a travel nurse contract
This was the week I would've gone to AGDQ but I decided to save money 🥲
I pronounce my days of the week by saying dee instead of day at the end
I'd fall off that loft at least once curtis8AAAAA
Very smooth turn Phan...perfect as always
I only slept 4 hours after work before having to get ready for this flight
I got a text box for you right here PantsGrab
homie wtf is a "grape demi reduction" that ain't even real u made that up ICANT also yo gl
curtis8F oh right I knew that
I swear it's there just to stop people
You almost checked for a hint
goats can eat almost anything. including time.
My ears are open amongst other things
In my I need to touch grass
I take back what I said about being smooth lolz
also that's a good quote too lmfao
I found a streamer playing tp on crowd control
Make sure you show her your rod
When you've played rando too long
I'm legally changing my name to Dragon Ball Z.
This isn't even my final form
Ok that's enough bad jokes from me
Ugh hate talking to the cuccoos too
Tail slap them twice and they're ded
At least it gets some tail for its efforts
Damn, sorry, I promised to stop the bad jokes XD
I try to turn off sass here and it just comes out naturally
Gotta love the helpful monkeys in Zelda games
he looks like a guy who saw the moon fall :P
He looks like the best Link
I wanted that phrase tattooed on me
I hope Low Transforms isn't 'normal' now LuL I can't keep doing that
you just gotta not spank him so hard
do you know you can skip the "we're gonna fight ook" cutscene?
well not by pressing start, by rolling around to the right instead of using the monkey chain to get to the central platform
since it's not a direct path back to the central platform
yay the game didn't shatter under the massive beating of a monkey this time
Is it just on my end, or did audio just get really distorted
Every time I open your chat twitch makes my whole chat purple and says please knock
I will resist the green goblin mask this time though
I cancel it myself after a few seconds just to remove your popup lol
rhone are you going to join the glitchless mm race
I kinda just run and throw in that room
strange, must have been the browser. Tried a different browser and sounds fine now.
You dont have to do this, you can swim and jump to the chest from behind
am I stupid for doing cave of ordeals 3 times to fill all my bottles with fairy tears and also doing roll goll 64 times
no, sounds like you were bored though LOL
I wanted a true 100% file
Its better than a true 100% skyward sword file :)
Imagine how long Tender Hearted took to make that.
In Skyward Sword there are tons of collectible things, and Tender Hearted took the time to fill them up for a 100% file.
i beat it once on wii game is bad
game is bad, too may cutscenes and I hate Fi
Ookless takes a while to  learn. DF has a good file.
However if you do ookless, you can throw his first bombling to make him appear faster.
nice one pokemon colloseum rando sounds fun
i just play rayman 3 i know wanna chill and enjoi yur stream
Rolling to Eldin is by far the best part of the run, I hope you enjoyed it
I played it 20 years ago and had nightmares as a child XD because of the game
when i see rayman i see supert ed from n64
i say as a child i hat my fun with super ed beatet ons
I was only able to save the game using a rumble pack, I never finished the game (couldn't save), I bought a rumble pack to save it, what do I do? I play through it without saving
i wish you good luck wreslting the naked old man
it's what's happening off screen during a shot zoomed in on Link's face during the cs before KB1
its always funny to slap him odd
my strat is the opposite, i do the issac strat, spam a until win
so i decided to bite the (higher fees) bullet and order Cane's through doordash since i hadn't had it yet lol
all you had to do was RIDE THE DAMN HORSE, LINK
insert tulio and miguel "GET. ON. THE HORSE."
I fall asleep for 2 minutes evo17Flip
honestly, i get the cane's hype
lmao 38 doesnt have many jokes about it no
the breading is the right amount, cooked well, the chicken is flavorful, and the sauce is good
oh we've had one but they aren't dashpass eligible
so i haven't tried it yet
@Mirby_Studios i read this as breeding and was very very confused
the strat is always sidestep -> B -> A
if he sidesteps while you do, still press B
his rng is more heavily weighted than Bo's, so it's always your best bet to do that
there's still some rng but in theory he is not as bad as bo
okay that cutscene is skippable with start
tp seems to be very good at documenting their stuff
erin and I try a lot with prime 2
cause some people like to upload unlisted videos and don't share stuff unless someone asks
the best speedrun documentation is the SRC guide on how to start running crash bash 200%
I upload a lot of unlisted stuff but it's all linked on zsr, as is my playlist
nah I'm doing some MM now
I don't think you can make that RTA
You can but it only saves 1f, according to Ekke I think
I think Simi has done it
I should check my english and jp disc loads to figure out what I should use for glitchless
jp is 2 seconds faster I think from text
some of the text boxes are slower but some are faster. I still think german is the fastest
I never thought to come back out via mini boss
i mean you're in a dungeon so close enough for me
I did not know you could shoot this down from here
Make sure not to die to this boss. I hear he's really difficult
look it's me when i step outside in july here
damn, hitting it from the back\
it's a cool strat. only worth it with ordon sword though
i woke up at 5 pm and decided to skip my meds today and just go to bed early
tbf i also went to bed at like, noon
i co9uldn sleep, and then at like 9:30 i cut my hair and dyed it pink
see i WANTED to wak eup at 2, but i turned off the alarm and passed back out
butyeah i take adderall so it keeps me up, so im skipping it today so i can go to bed earlier and not like, 5am
ya know i never knew you could kill those guys as human for several years until i saw speedruns as a child
idk why did you press A on the horse if you didn't wanna get on? What
i mena yeah, i got the game in 2007, i was 10
but yeah was like, late teen like 17 or so when i started waatching Kejs, first one i saw do a tp run back when he was WR and was astonished you could do it as huma lmao
FeelsStrongMan kejs had record when I started running
now im out here like, yes this owl statue chest is attainable sphere 1
yeah kejs was the first tp runner i was watching  before beest
i could ever do any% or really any speedrun
simply bcuz idk how livesplit works
it took me several hours just to get a simple timer when i started doing rando races lmao
the first speedrun I took seriously was like a 4 hour run for me at the time
but i have done 16 star for fun before
16 star is a great speedrun for funzies
I could never take sm64 seriously
I find it hard to motivate myself to learn things when I want to learn things
ill brb going to pick up food
the twilights are more fun than you'd think with practice
-15C or 5F it was awful
Oh you're going all the way in
It's Lakebed... a zelda water temple. It's gonna have cutscenes since it's so scenic
Man helms don't like you lolz
yep same thing happened to me with a metroid prime 2 run
some random guy copyright claims the lower torvus bog theme
its so annoying getting those claims removed, much easier on twitch to get it removed
like these people sample these songs in their music which is fine but they go and coptright it illegally
yeah itss ridiculous, it happens alot to me for the fishing hole theme
what rando does to your brain
i was gonna say that sound slike alie
I have a weird reason for it
i keep claw pn x bcuz bow goes on y
when me and my brother were kids he liked hookshot/clawshot on the Y button so I decided to be different have it on X
and that preference has stuck with me forever
bow goes on y bcuz id usually put iron boots there, but w quick transformm you cant equip/unequip boots on y while olding chains in gm
idk, i was never told otherwise it just became habit
my preferences are Claw X, bow Y, Boomerang Y. everything just goes where those two aren't
yeah bcuz i did bring it up to them, and then was never updated it lmao
claw has highest priority to me
most people are Claw Y Rang X
stick goes anywhere bro come on
lmao all i know is ocarina is c down
bombs also go on any c-button
but hook goes on c-right if you're using gamecube (X)
Ok I literally just tabbed back in to type and twitch told me to knock again
Anyways I just beat ys 8
I was really not caring for the story for the first while of that game but that 2nd half really pulled me in
Also multiple chars when you max out their bond were like "Adol, there's some people out there who are gonna fucking get you" so I assume that's the next game
I did pretty much everything except like a couple raid thingies I didn't feel like doing and the 1 extra thing for postgame
I 100%'d the map and treasures and all that
Actual fun game to explore in
Woke up from a seizure... I'm dizzy and have a headache
I will... decided to watch your stream until I fall back to sleep
Damn ys 9 is only 8gb
Do you know the quick knock down
Its basically just hug the wall, 5 slow rolls, walk a few steps then spinner
At least that's how I do it
yeah i can do it very rarely
its the fourth trill, i had to watch a video pointing it out bcuz its hardto describe w words
I see you're streaming on YT now too
using spinner to leave is fast btw. for some reason in stallord's room spinner has like 3 billion speed
That's actually how I noticed you were live tonight lol
I saw you live before in YouTube
i saw you live when discord told me KEKW
i saw you were live when i st down at my pc and opened twitch lol
if I like the game enough I remember it easily
ive done rando for so long i know where every chest in thje game is
do i know the vanilla contents??? absolutley not
I think I've memorized this game by now
I'm not sure if I know where every grotto or overworld chest is
i know where boss key chests are bcuz they are different looking lmao
I've never done randomizer for this game but i've 100%ed it like 5 times this year
its very fun if you know the game well
Gonna head to bed... this headache is killing me... phanto274GL with the game and have fun
im so exciting theyre working on entrance rando rn
I would probably just use the most common settings
yeah i'm spoiled by metroid prime 1/2 randomizer
and get shit out of logic
they have sliders for trick levels for each individual trick
so like they have beginner bomb jump tricks, expert bomb jump tricks
to be fair, tp rando is literally only on ver5sion 1.2
oot and mm and combo ootmm has tr5ick lists
so I would probably have to do glitchless rando because I know how to do zora armor skip/ljas and stuff but I don't know epona oob stuff
no but i mean they've only put out two major updates
I don't care too much about cosmetic stuff
all the storage stuff is kinda dumb tbh
just because you have to walk across the map to do storage
wolf fur colour change coming soon
i have their uh, github to do list bookmarked i check it like once a week lmao
maybe I'll change link's tunic color but every hud color I see someone have is so bad so it makes me not wanna change it
@Draconif i always hit rando everything unti i  see tunic colors i like, when i just match them, all up
so it's either fully glitched logic, fully glitchless logic, or no logic
no logic is really fun if you know the game really well
but yeah theyre adding freestanding, entrance rando, random starting, and portals in item pool
it didnt use to be like that
but you used to just have to go to an area at least once to get the portal
i think portals in item pool w entrance rando is gonna go hard, especially if weget the option in the future of portals go to differnt areas, but i can see that being a pain
I know rando has quick transform
rando has q transform, fast climb and fast iron boots
ive never used iron boots on sand
but i'm ok with HD qol
me wondering why you don't have spinner and bombs equipped just to remember this is the western ruleset
wait really? so i dont just suck w poe 1 skip, its the rando thnats the problem lmao
i always use clawshot anything so poe 1 skip is always free phanto274Smile
clawshot anything? is that an option??
its an option in mm rando so i just enable it for tp rando too lol
i wonder if tp bingomizer is any good
ive only done 2 bingo raaces
i never knew how to make it super consistent though
I think the aim is too high
i think you're too far right
thepri67Love dylanjLove tippiALove ghunzoLove tghLove marcoLove AmbessaLove popesLove
just carve these skull kids into arrows
i dont know of any arrow drops in lost woods
... youre supposed to use arrows? i would just do this as dog
well this are id use bomb arrows, but i think the skulls may have arrowsd here?
i think you can also hit him w claw im not sure
when you enter tot the left pot by the switch has arrows
I didn't know that one had guaranteed arrows
most pots in tot have arrows i find, its er5y helpful
press B right after you press A
this one you have to let link swing forward more
it's more precise than the other one
it's based on where the camera was in the cutscene, so you had to hold up
that bad for a run this long
any crash in a good run is annoying
only way i know quick money is that lmao
i hate that you cant warp thjere its so annoying
yeah all of them take a while. the only one that could maybe be good is the one at lake hylia bridge
and even the puppets drop like a singular arrow
I mean mm runs typically were dead to bad drops for bombs
it doesn't anymore, but it used to
i gotta go to bed, gl on rest of run
why does that dragon have a sword and shield?
Yeah, but not nearly as well
There's an arrow chest in the next room, but you probably won't go that way
It's in this room, on the ledge you're walking past now
That might actually be the optimal route for glitchless, it's been a while
minus 11. but this is rly bad. fatpidTHONK
now you have to put in the time
We could all use a cuppy of milkers
@buff00n u know good and well what i meant
Thank god I don't run this game
I wouldn't stand how long it is
Regardless, 4+ hours is something I couldn't do
Idk shit about glitchless, but I do know tpgz is your lover for this game KEKW
Can you even do it with REL?
That's the best unfortunate shit I've seen in this game in 5 years
What makes me wonder is if there's a void plane, just because I'm that curious at fucking nothing
I have mac and cheese and chicken tendies to make for later
you know which, no need to say
fireman tweking got me feeling different
this music sounds like its from the oracle games
i started my blind vaniila tooie playthru
almost about to leave whitchy world
why dont you mod the exe1 title screen on exe6
just say its the japanese version of bn1
keiz speedrun is such a call back
even you dont intend to RNG manip, simply selecting continue from the title screen is still defined as RNG manip hence why we run single segment
its only that way for 1-3 btw
4-6 capcom stepped their game up
next time make bn1 a longer ETA LUL
redo the route, add ghost navi drops and dont do reddit skip LUL
incentive to NOT DO reddit skip KEKW
ad 10 if you know the comps
I thought you didnt know life virus skip lol
also if you fail it puts you back to post magicman fight
im 20 jiggies into tooie now
btw i got confirmation my X7 shipped, how long should it take? like 30 days?
im liking my new headphones, but I knew I would. Just went from mx40 to mx50
my old pair is fine, just the headband leather is peeling very bad
I can get a zip on cover for that tho
how you were in my recommend how are the speedruns going
I find it funny that everyone in colo cord including the person who originally made the program is like yea this program is very outdated in the programming language it uses lmao
I thought c++ was good what happened AAAA
I always hated hooking up gui to backend
At least I can easily edit the sheet ratJAMMIN
I don't think any of my college friends have gotten hacked lmfao
Smart engineers at a dumbass uni
meowdy Phantom, hope the practice is going well! phanto274GL
Oh fuck it was Supernova lmao
I called Supernova soft for not blocking anyone yet KEKW
Is this a spreadsheet for mega man
Okay I was wondering what the dots were AINTNOWAY
I dunno I saw a second place on there monadoGiggle
great to hear, if you pb I'll shove an entire carrot up my ass
I know you told me, but you never know bro KEKW
as an I guess former oot runner those two emotes fit so well
you see i just told me friend to swipe for a gacha character KEKW
Just get lucky it's a skill issue
we HolidayCookie HolidayCookie cooked HolidayCookie HolidayCookie this 1st hr.
oh I don't want the carrot
even when Higsby's not manning the counter, he's still making money
" gonna storm a terrorist base, I'll be back before dinner " - Lan, probably
GG to goodness late for getting my snack
phanto274GG on the runs, better luck next time!
aww someone beat me to first
hmmm i think twitch is messing up for me. it says continue subs on both of them and no stars or info. just says try again later. and this is after reloading
so if you have a free moment,  can you inform us what the game is about :)
well the story i mean. I'm only used to the megaman x series, as well as the OG megaman 1-10
i know nothing of the battle network
basically instead of dr light making robot children, he had a family. this is his family. wily is still a spiteful jerk.
well... at least all the character portraits look like its out of a horror movie
@Mirby_Studios thanks for the explanation. so next question following up with your statement: is Dr. Light young and having kids or is he building his "family"
yeah you play as his grandson in this
gotcha gotcha. so basically you're pretty much his living legacy that goes into computers and getting rid of virus's. and the damn doc's dead
it's also that instead of robotics, the world focused on network technology, that's the biggest difference
i know this will sound stupid, but whats the games version of "network technology"   is it basically everything is a smart device?
sounds close to what we are now a days
so they are hacking our smart devices huh? I'll keep a closer eye on my thermostat just in case
now does this game have the whole level up system or do you buy your specs/progression stuff
in this one you buy the PowerUPs to increase your stats
nice, so it sounds like you don't have to do unnecessary grinding
later games in the series swap that out mostly aside from the HP increases for a heavier customization system where you can have more specific builds and such
hey phantom, gl on the run
Its a shame that internet 8 said no
escape chips not cooperating is such a pain
so story wise, the boy you play on the overworld is the grandson, and the character inside the machines is megaman? or does he have a different name
with 4 comps to run through its really hard to get escape chips all the time. Thank goodness for R button strats
I blessed the run and it paid off
the overworld character is named Lan, he's the grandson, his digital AI assistant is MegaMan
lol megaman is the new siri
*gasp* so apple stole the idea from capcom
i smell a lawsuit for megasiri
AI have got faces like navis
dude could you imagine hackers getting into your TV and playing baby shark on loop for hours on end?
before we know it chatGPT will have a face
hey as long as the face is kat dennings i'm good with it lol
they aren't even hard to beat either. Just hp sponges
now when you use the chips, do they go away permanently?
you are correct about their hp
@Shadowcire thats how paper mario sticker star works LUL
@past88345 don't think i've ever heard that game
i just know PM 64, TTYD, and only heard of the origami one
where you can turn into a paper plane and stuff like that
its the 3ds paper mario game that had a lost trailer up on youtube recently for fans to see
whenever i remember i'll have to look it up
the trailer is very different to how the final game was
the heavy reliance on stickers was already in place, and it's hard to see what unique purpose the partners served, and as such may be another reason they were cut
oh they cut out partners in future paper marios?
partners haven't been as much of a thing since super paper mario i'd say. you had the pixls sure but they were more... ability helpers than true partners
so really the only 2 games with partners were the first 2
The environments looked cooler in the trailer and mole king boss would been cool to fight
thats like making super mario RPG without a team
it's a mario RPG without a team you get so
but i mean... red apples are better than green :D
honestly with the reception to the TTYD remake i think future paper marios will be more RPGs
instead of the adventure games they were turning into
cause super had very light RPG elements already, and with sticker star and color splash those were just adventure games with even lighter RPG elements
sounds like they butchered it to make it different for "reasons"
their vision for it wasn't an RPG anymore
hoping paper mario returns to its RPG form and does creative things with the formula
and thats a evil vision lol
Indie devs have made some interesting paper mario inspired games
@past88345 open world papermario where you traverse books as "dungeons"
bug fables especially shows the potential modern paper mario has
but yeah i do know one reason for stepping away from storylines isn't even them. japanese club nintendo members shortly after super paper mario dropped (which has a heavy reliance on story) responded to a player survey with how they did not like the story at all
i swear that bot is a fever dream come to life
so like it's not even the devs entirely to blame
they got feedback from a set of fans who could take the survey and they went with that
must've been terrible to switch genres
that wasn't even to them tho lol, that was about galaxy. his advice to them was about the characters and they went overboard
yeah you can't argue with mayamoto, he is the father of it
yeah he hated the version he played, which was the version in the trailer that dropped recently
and they... didn't change much lmao
which says a lot cause he's clarified his story comment recently saying he focuses on gameplay first and foremost
so if he hates the gameplay of something, especially something mario, you fucked up lmao
like he doesn't HATE story, he just puts its importance in game design behind the gameplay. which like, fair
story is important but if the game plays like dogshit nobody's gonna play it long enough to care about any story
true, not every game has the buster max option LUL
speaking on that, i enjoy games that are 8bit with great stories and gameplay, graphics don't mean sh*t if everything is executed poorly
yeah. plus the advice he gave to intsys about "try using only existing mario characters" was just advice and people think it was a corporate mandate they had no choice but to follow. an d like no, it was a tip they could choose to ignore. they did the opposite
so devs were just being bullheaded for no reason
big shame because original characters would have made sticker star feel less lonely
true. but they were being bullheaded that's undeniable lol
intsys in recent years has said they have basically full creative control over paper mario tho and have had that so
The funny thing is paper jam having no original characters was more of budget constraints. So alphadream restricted themselves like intelligent systems
with paper jam you could tell the writers wanted to do more with it
paper jam still has fantastic gameplay at least
the fear of lacking rng chips
its so funny how protoman flinches to a charged buster shot
hopefully you don't have to fight extra bosses
just in case anyone was asleep
also that legit got my anxiety up to maximum so thanks
only 2 months from 4 years
then I gotta stop cause that's too many
I won't say anything about my ass
And gl and I'll see you after I shower
Motherfucker you wanted a Pic of me with the carrot up my ass
Hey Phantom! Hope you are doing well phanto274Jam
That flareon and fuecoco are coolness let me guess u got them at best buy?
12345? That's the password on my luggage!
have a good night my dude
god you beat me to 1st again
I've got a MAD craving for a chicken sammich for some reason
chik fil a sounds super good right now
MegaMan X music for MegaMan.EXE, I'm in favor of it
17% of your viewers have degenerate issues
@SwiftPichu_ what's the half-life on a viewer?
I had to watch that clip you shared twice to realize the run wasn’t dead lmao
how many viewers will there be left in two years?
@En_Passant 3 and half a snickers bar
Unironically for a viewer they usually are around for like, 3 year or so
both. and it being big and veiny on top
Can I tongue play with both of them?
i'd be sad if you didn't
At least this tutorial is fast
just like the midget stuff i watch
why not? i have a judgement kink
Gives me even more of a reason to do so
We'll just dm each other it's fine
that almost sounded like another Shadow quote
@SwiftPichu_ i feel left out :(
Don't tell me it's a rip from duel links
Which one is it because I never knew there was a game with VA
Oh the one game who never made it to Mexico
I got so pissed because I really wanted to play that game KEKW
All we got was falsebound kingdom and duelists of the roses
Nah, my ps2 was set to English once I realized ratchet was in Spaniard Spanish
Yugioh voice line is so good at at those pulls
then i asked about 687354 questions about it
Axl talks abt it but I have no idea how this game works at all
it was explained to me like this: the draw system is like having a deck of 30 cards, and you can buy them or win them off battles
the bar at the top during battle is when you can select more cards, or as this game puts it, chips, and use those during battle
and what phantom just explained i didn't know about lol (minus the tied up teacher, i have plenty of those in my closet)
and the ones phantom really, really wants is the chips that has a person running. those are battle escapes
I am watching I'm just also getting my nails done ATM can't talk lol
@PeachedPocky do I? this game is fucking ass
idk just battle Network in general idk which one this is
how was the the rest of that attempt?
is it just me or is there a shitton more encounters this run?
RNG is a fickle mistress, Shadow
well i am home and gotta set up for my own stream but i will be dropping a lurk!
Yes in time. How are things?
Of course always pray to RNGesus for good runs
You keep doing this run, I'll go play with a rubber band
Somehow I pronounced gutsman as gust man
Anyways BRB gonna eat gutsmans ass
yo phantom hope you're doing well swifWave
I could not get their chip ever
I don't think I ever know the one to get it from x_x
Ah, that's where I already faught them, but I guess I never managed to double delete
I tried to 100% but internet netnavi fights was awful
S ranking and not getting the V3 is brutal
Ninja Gaiden voice: "God can't help you now"
Good evening and good luck on the run(s)
let it be known i know like nothing about these games let alone whatever this is swifSip
same can be said for a lot of what i watch i come to vibe and the games are a nice bonus lmao swifLurk
network is my fave megamanned speedrun maybe the x games are ahead of it.
bn3 is my fave bc all top 10 runs on leaerboard have dif elements regardless of dumb custom style
i guess im thinking of megaquints youtube races
Whats ur take on megaman and bass?
I find the 8 robot masters the best and angled powered up weapons
Very excited for this run bbirbHeadDesk
Have u setup the scenes and other stuff btw? Im curious if u did it since its required
Would it be worth save scumming those?
went to the gym and just got back, how are runs going?
sucks to be at the mercy of RNG like that
if it’s half as hard as that doc you shared o can only imagine
are you for real you got a quil
This is epic so I get to hear voice as well.
he's the sub in case the other receptionist gets sick
neither did I but here we are
the second fight is the bare minimum right?}
oh, I just know that the colosseum you want hyper mode
I wonder what factors affect this shit
you say you wanted 2, there ya go chief
I know that's wes boo but I still see it as naruto
I mean not much you can do with the shades looking like a fucking headband
I think there's a pc at the beginning of the tower though
from this point on you want quil rxp right ?
my typing today is fucking terrible
I think just as you purify you get fucked up
Do you need blaze by a certain point?
Oh good then POG no damage
nothin like a good ole fashion bot fight
does eagun even have the pikachu in xd? it's been forever
one thing I will say though, xd is better casually for getting all the shadow mons
I wanna say yes it was like level 12 or 13
while here you're stuck with what you catch
I just wanna see if the mf evolves or run dead
The run shall not be dead not on me watch
Damn not even close was it?
what level does quilava need to evolve?
with the late hypers it makes sense
this run is just that punishing
omg that was actually so close
Way less hoping for the manip
I must conclude you for a Quilava
My brain did not do the brain thing
There was a day years ago I said I would start speed running Colosseum or XD
do you like the poison one
currently taking up space in marks hotel room
yo gl hitting frames today Phantom!
When agitated, this POKéMON protects itself by spraying poisonous sweat from its pores.
Good day and good luck on the runs! can you explain what you were doing just now?
oh nice after what you did last night? I gotta say seeing the behind the scenes made it way less daunting
I preordered Colosseum when it came out and got the jirachi bonus disk. A few years later, my brother helped me sell it on ebay for like $5
I saw the route had times in it but how precise is it in comparison to the starting?
I only ever rented Colosseum from blockbuster
for the waiting time, how precise to leave this battle?
ah okay that makes sense, just don’t want to over roll the rng
Do you have a manip for the quilava as well?
I'm dyeing my hair pink againne
Wait idk if you seen my pink hair at all
So you have to do all this setup, and then run is basically dead if you get a bad natured quilava?
Yes made it for a run.
it was. I’m just really tired today.
I even took a nap but I’m still tired
I think I’ll chill for the rest of the day and read or something
be sure to eat coin :)
Christ on psywave of all things
I had to take a nap today because i was up late thanks to rando LUL
quick, lets do World one in SMB1 swifDerp
Help me there is a lasagna in my ass
The sauce was the best part
You're doing it for memes at this point
I'm glad I missed the adamant regice I had in the last seed
what is this? good rng? in a colo run?
I was thinking the same thing lmao
is it actually working today? cause last time i remember it was being mean
There's also a consistent feel for it without the visual
I dont need to look at link to roll clip
i'm experimenting with something new: i have my taskbar at the top of my screen so i can see the clock at all times
And my 1f links in kof11 are easy just cause it's a fast rhythm that I just dont drop
I was looking at the sheet you sent me and the rng manips didnt make any sense to me lol
Apparently a lot of people do taskbar on the top
my desk fan normally blocks the bottom right of my main monitor and my water bottle does the same with my secondary
I pretty much always see it on the bottom
I always put mine down there
W11 actually prevents you from moving the taskbar entirely, but i saw a recommendation of a free app from someone i trust that lets me do that anyways lol
If you do side what's wrong with you
it's also because my work computer doesn't let me show seconds on the clock and at work i need to respond within one minute or time out every minute if the chatter is not responding for 3 minutes so i can be more accurate
i have it showing on W11, my work computer is actively blocking that option
Do a run with umbreon NOW
i mean i'll take a fry randomizer
some are garlic, some are cheese, some are chili, it's doable
a mix of waffle and curly, purely random
like of all things the bot could've said were randomized, fries are actually doable lmfao
ohey phantom you're in my area, lemme say hi :P
look as long as i'm living here i'm going to keep making the "i live in orre" jokes
are you adamant about this iceblueSmug
how many IV does it have though
how much phone number did this thing cry for KEKW
oh yeah phantom i beat digimon world data squad and i may have oneshot the final boss
it's really funny for lucemon satan mode to pop out and just get one tapped
look it's the game's fault. the optional bosses put up a fight. they take a beating. i just used the strat i used for those to actually beat them and... i guess i overbuffed lmao
as for why lucemon, game uses an original story with the characters from the show. well the DATS members from the show.
it deals with the seven demon lords
i'm sorry, this is dub. seven deadly digimon :P
but yeah one of those characters is voiced by roger craig smith and like 80% of his lines are delivered with what he would go on to use for his sonic voice
so i just started calling that character sonic
the battle system relies on your digimon's emotions and your available commands are based on how your digimon feels and while you can somewhat affect their mood with items or support commands its still somewhat random.
and choosing moves they don't want to do (represented by showing up the fewest times on screen) lowers your friendship with them
also annoying when you have evolution requirements that require a certain amount of command categories used and your digimon never wants to do that lol
there is one funny quirk with this system tho
so once you meet all requirements for an digivolution you have to trigger it in battle. so your tamers go digisoul charge
but marcus has to hit digimon to get that energy
and... if he KOs a digimon you skip your turn and have to come back around to try again lmao
there was legit one battle where both enemy digimon were at like barely any health so i had to wait til NEXT BATTLE to digivolve agumon cause marcus would've ko'd either of them
but yeah the game did not get good reviews. i guess the battle system didn't vibe with reviewers
but having beaten it... it's not bad. i've played much worse
i've played worse digimon even lmao
i mean i was doing hardcore RA so no save states lmao
but i did fast forward a lot
also the RA leaderboard for game time beaten relies on in-game time which... is sped up when you fast forward!
so i beat the game in 44 hours. which is not at all accurate
the nice thing is it only pops up on screen once you get to the final boss's phase 2
so it's not showing you game time the entire damn game
that's how i noticed it was based on the in-game timer cause the RA overlay also sped up when i fast forwarded lmao
at which point... feels like the leaderboard shouldn't be a thing if you are punished for placing in it for using a convenience feature
like i don't mind the "steps taken" leaderboard which, while silly, doesn't get messed up by fast forwarding
so it's a low bar for the quilava to clear then :P
look it can't possibly be worse than the LAST quilava. with two 1 IVs
i take full responsiblity when this quilava has 3 0s
i asked maddy to pick up paper towels at costco. did not expect them to come in just now with a fuckin' TWELVE PACK
is that like trying to get out of first cycle
So I take it you got the framer? PogBones
was joking with maddy about how you just said you hate spoink and maddy went "everyone hates spoink spoink is a terrible pokemon"
Well maybe you should tell Quil to get it together
are you duping great balls there?
Ok. I'm debating, do I order a pizza or go get sandwiches
Yeah. First turn item glitch. If you use an item during your first half of the turn, in the second half if you swap the locations, the game uses the index of the location to remove it from your inventory, but it uses the item you originally selected
Well. Quil. I said get it together. And you didn't.
well it's not WORSE than the last one
On the plusle side, Espeon is pretty good
Although I'm just gonna say it. A game full of double battles and a plusle with no early game minum to snag is a prosecutable crime
your doing the exact same thing as the last time I opened stream and idk what’s happening
I look forward to that. I saw you talk about it in the podcast
colo has started popping up in my youtube algorithm and I have no complaints
Ahh RIP apparently I forgot to use a coupon a couple weeks ago. Oh well
So get the framer or very specific frames late 4Head
hey - that means you can be off by 2 frames twice, if you're late - right? swifDerp
correction: "just be an even number of frames less then 6 late to the first and you gucci"
It's not that hard 4Head it's only impossible
Personally I think it'd be more fun to get it
You should try setting flowtimer to the pause button on livesplit btw (since pause starts livesplit)
Also I have seen 3 espy and I've also seen 4 espy
Please one more? I've been in the hospital almost all day
We all love one more PogChamp
Just how far you'd get then?
phanto274GL and HF on the runs
thank you for giving me something to watch while everyone else is at GDQ
btw I finished Banjo last night
Tooie is top tier, people sure do shit on iit alot
only thing I didnt like was Grunty taking me 2 hours
It's worse level design with everything taking 10x longer for no reason
canary mary is meh (second go around) but outside of that it's not AS bad as people insist it is like it's Rare's greatest sin
"no reason" it's a bigger game
I'm talking about incredibly long cutscenes for basic actions
I never cared for the first Banjo, so
Coney during his last event restream was joking about how it would be an incredible challenge to get a jiggy in tooie before a sonix set finished
The button mashing rubber banding to almost impossibility
yeah cloud cuckooland canary mary is awful i won't deny that
the longer missions was what I loved about it, wish modern mario had more fo that
like if SMO had interconnected worlds that played off each other id enjoy it way more
honestly i'd rather a sequel make the collectibles maybe a bit trickier to get than how half of them in kazooie were basically "walk up press two buttons get jiggy"
@Axl_SR What is, Jak and Daxter, for $500 Axl_SR
jak doesn't do that nearly as much as you think
You dont like 10fps in a game that moves slow?
wait that's eggman from the moviews
maybe one or two things but
It's such a good feature that pokemon brought it in for sv
Ima go sleep now though, developing headaches again ._.
good luck on the run and stuff
damn, they really left her in a bag out in the desert sun, dude's are lucky she's still alive
sure the frame is rough at times but thats the version AP is using so you just get used to it
holy pulled an Espeon already gl gl phanto274GL
as long as a world "feels" connection, I don't care if it really is or isn't
a consistent 30fps is fine, I'm not sure why it's considered "unplayable" all of the sudden
SV started to make me feel nauseous if you stayed in the lake areas too long
Modern games on console running like that is inexcusable
I never noticed it watching streams or it but I’m sure that’s something that doesn’t come across like that
i know someone that HATES when a game is capped at 30 cause it's apparently a disservice and no game should ever be that low
I fully believe it, it’s such a shame I hope they learned their lesson
Game Freak can NOT fuck up Black & White remakes, people will trash their HQs
as long as that studio is allowed to cook this time
cause ILCA can cook when allowed to, i've seen it
so i blame TPC for the issues in BDSP
@buff00n *Whomever makes the Black / White remakes can NOT fuck 'em up
I mean they sure did for gen 4 and that is more beloved
Gen 5 is a better base shell though
So it is harder to make it ass
I like Gen 5 mostly cuz TMs don't break
also it was announced today that an upcoming booster pack for the digimon card game is entirely Cyber Sleuth themed
DP are ass that game wasnt fun till plat
i can't wait for the option card where i blow out my opponent's ear drums with the title theme
i like some Gen5 mons but i'm thankful that BW2 eased up on the "unova only" idea
it’s true, the evolutions levels were stupid but I’m glad B2W2 opened the selection at least
the evolution levels were AWFUL for unova mons. like WHY do i have to wait to SIXTY FOUR
I’m iffy on Gen 5 too
i guess you find the mons unfezant
FUCK the fire starter, that thing ALWAYS gets fucked up whenever I use the bastard
look i'm forever mad that they changed the name of bouffalant's signature move
here it's the boring HEAD CHARGE
that sounds so much cooler and better lmao
in bw2 you can get a lv30 one with the overworld encounter
also i maintain that Emboar should've been named Boarbecue
Same route pretty much though lol
Pretty sure the volcarona is 35
reminder that braviary's JP name is WARRGLE
I started playing W2 a while ago just so I could try Braviary before 54 or whatever level it evolves
and that's just fun to say
What the fuck is that volcarona emote
that feels more like singles though
@Pallos7 you don't understand the culture
that' s what i was getting at lol
i just didn't want to type competitive
is it possible? we have a runnable quilava?!?
is mild bad for the purifying and hyper mode necessary?
The gen 5 walking meme wins
I just moved my setup and had an old monitor from work as my third and oh my god is it a game changer
I mean you stream enough lmao
that was the only reason I wanted one since Pape takes up a whole monitor and everything is scrunched
i don't have room for a third monitor. i could fit one on my desk and plug it into my computer but i don't have a spare outlet for it lmao
I need to replace this laptop, so it might be time to get a PC
if / when I do, I'm grabbing a 2nd monitor. 2nd monitor's OD
I had to get monitor arms to fit them all otherwise I’d have zero deskspace
Fair I have a decent size ikea desk or I’d have no hope at all
I have 2 27” and a 24” so that’s probably why you don’t struggle with 2
Time for twitch handle number 1 Moltres fan to enter the chat
I don't feel like describing my setup, so I'll post a picture to Discord
Oh I thought the bot just said that for a sec
Axl gonna fly out the bot Pog
His brows and stache makes me think of bobobo
Oh shit I'm back in ad city
Shall observe it as thoroughly as possible
Did you have to get the party together to advance the RNG?
Okay that makes more sense and I’m assuming an everdrive
and it's specifically the moltres that advances the rng?
oh wait I’m not thinking right, I’m sure you can just use tool to import the team
not me thinking people are busting out their GameCube link cable
Phan that was actually legit question. Idk if someone will do something
giving you a lot of fast ones today
oh my god not the split
Operation get Phantom a good Espeon phanto274Ban
Holy no wonder Mild is so rare
oh my god you’re rolling for that just for the last fight that’s wild
with enough defense, do you ever survive that crit from your first run?
I doubt it considering base stats but maybe there are some rolls that live
Might be 65 if I remember the eeveelution numbers that are swapped around
Couple that with a middling base HP and you get Furret being scary
yeah the level is not in your favour either
How long do you consider waiting, like 4ish minutes?
And what's 5 and a half at this point?
do you have the gameboy cable for 4 moltres?
it would save a lot of time in the long run
But a lot of work to setup
Who doesn't love a fire flying type
I had to look it up, Oricorio
I think they're in S/V now too
I know they were definitely in Kitakami, the ghost ones
But i've never used in my life
You would have missed like 2 tries so far Sadge
This, resetting every time and hoping sounds horrendous
It feels like it would be around 10-12 in
jeez. I didn't realize it was that expensive
I wonder which ones aren't these days
No no, 39 is better than 50 YEP
damn, a hooker spit on me AND you're streaming on a Friday? Todays been fanstastic
That's not a hugely favourable range to kill either
That’s right that fight was horrendous
if you could get the flamethrower tm…
Or typhlosion didn’t learn it in the 50’s or 60’s
that’s fair it is a pokemon speedrun
that espeon is quite literally nice
so it’s not killing Duskull is what you’re saying lol
it just had to be better. didn't have the skill to do that
That would be a great idea
"Will this Quilava be runnable? No. No but in Spanish."
and for your espeon to not get ganked by a furret afterward
want me to make 1 real quick
one of my favorite series of games ever
I never thought but these must have almost max friendship to start off with too
Wow I actually got 10 Phantokens EZ
The Devil that Walks to a Gen 5 tune
Just because of heart gauge levels?
wait was that THE GUY we saw OUTSIDE
In the second game it's revealed it's actually his first day on the job haha!
It's in one of the news stories "it's revealed that his story of 40 long years of cranking gears is a lie and it's closer to 39."  And since the 2nd story is set like a year or so after the first one haha.
Yo, the first time I've seen a Colosseum speedrun in a Colosseum
Because they wanted to be a special kind of speedrunner
I can only imagine someone losing a run to a 1/256
the odds of something happening might be small but it will happen
Pokemon is one of those games where it happens 100% of the time 1/256th of the time
Like when you are born there is an RNG role, and if it lands on 256, your pokemon will always leave hyper mode
Your killing my cousin!  He owes me fish...
Wow, you're such a good trainer! Let me escort you into our guarded base without considering who you are!
But that's why it has speed boost D:
I love how your pokemon don't listen to you, except to attack, UNLESS they are GMO'd to not feel emotion are hyper... That makes sense
They could have put any other text there
How hard would it have been to say "Espeon is already paying attention to you"
See. Like that. It's meaningless to use that item here. Not the item didn't work, just it doesn't mean anything in this situation. Game devs are aware of that concept
But calling your Pokemon can't just simply be meaningless, no Espeon have to SPECIFICALLY just not be listening to its trainer except for battle commands
Ok I actually love this game it's just one of those details that I'm like "Someone specifically wrote that and it doesn't make sense"
hi phantom i have a question for you
you sent us like.. 5 boxes of floss
there is so much of it
It has your name on it from amazon
Your teeth are gonna be SO clean
I am deadass serious, it has your name on it, and there's so many of it
ok I type that and twitch once again asks me to knock
I looked at it and I was like.. "phantom doesn't live here anymore..." *opens it* "Huh this is kinda heavy... what is- oh that's floss.. oh god.. why is there so much of it??"
Like.. if it was 1 maybe 2.. I'd understand
is it always oblivious? or is it thick fat? I’m assuming abilities randomize between the 2?
I wish I saw the damage range
ooo a run instead of  watching fire types :P
the model looks weird to me
It has an edgy Galarian form
i dont not like them just the modle
@darkapplequeen We needed to snag the Meditite
Otherwise in terms of Pokemon we will have no pokemon
And if we have no pokemon in a Pokemon game, you're just a loser
And we didn't Speedrun to be a loser
is it back to stare at fire types time again
AND we get the added side benefit of rescuing a GMO pokemon from an evil person and an extra body
Imagine missing when lunging yourself knee first
it sure isn’t Gen 1 crit rate
I swear someone at Pokemon put some secret line of code that checks if "good" rng would actually be bad in the situation, and if so, guarantees it
i think flareeon on background needs to be closer for good luck
would this manip be different if performed on a gamecube instead of a wii?
Best platform to be GBA games: GC. Best platform to play GC games: Wii. Best platform to play Wii games: Wii U. Best platform to play Wii U games: The DX/Deluxe re-release for the Switch Kappa
You know what they need to do
They need to make a PokeBall where the red/white is sideways and call it the Miror Ball
It's a special ball that has an extra catchrate for lotad and ludicolo
Or maybe like any "dancing" pokemon
Should be the one around 14x
Unless there's multiple around that, then gl lol
@Swiftalu oh look who it is
holy snot this new rng program has HUGE font
Did Juan finish approving updates or
Nah I can wait it's chill
Yo it's a very fast alu swifWave
Banjo kept me up at nights, I ccan finally sleep now
I was hearing the voices in my sleep LUL
Just do both runs at the same time
honestly glitchless could be the wave for me, ive only done any% (very hard and time consuming)
did you do your BN event already?
It's like TP Glitched but without the glitches
You gotta attempt to connect with its heart
Wait why do we call it here?
Dude your mode is so hyper you don't even know
Oh hey you finally got a good espeon?
The espeon met all of the required stats on the postinf
A bad colosseum in the game dedicated to colosseums
The important thing is that we get the spoon this time
I, personally, forbid it with the power I invested in me
seems were on a run. Back from halftime my buckeyes are up.
has pape dropped in price? my local is selling it for $55. Never seen it that low
they have jet force gemini for 15, that surprises me
Dude you could revive someone with that revive
You really needed to heal D:
They don't need your modern medicine
Oh. I'm being informed apparently they do
It's about the principle of the matter
Seeking specific performance, not monetary gains
im slowly replacing my shittily hacked together UI with a better one on my speedrun timer
i did some speedruns with it tho, it does work
also im like 5 minutes away from bopping a pc runner on the hl2 leaderboards lol
it being harder means i have to be more careful and more precise
Miror is timeless never gets old
and then if i ever run on PC again i can use strats i came up with for xbox to make it really easy lol
Wait did your quil die again
I saw it died a couple of times in pyrite and was like oh no
But at least sheet will not assume ty if you don't evolve
People have done first fight no ty lol
Hey at least it wasn't crit sixeTada
Oh I saw, Zeke told me lmao
Was like "That's why I am scared to use confusuon"
"BALTOY was burned!" "BALTOY was hurt by its burn!" "BALTOY fainted!"
"BALTOY was burned!" "BALTOY used Cosmic Power!" "BALTOY's SP DEF and DEF rose!" "BALTOY was hurt by its burn!" "BALTOY fainted!"
Thanks Swift. I was having trouble keeping up
The defenses might be wrong but it might as well be 1 message with how fast they pop up
Wynaut at least isn't too bad of a lead
Dude that Geodude just got geo'd
I moved all shifted info + that in there so you don't need to scroll up and down
(I hated scrolling up and down)
Great start for sure but its tied going into 4th.
"Oh fuck does Venus target my dumb fuck fire fish lemme just SCROLL ALL THE WAY UP TO FIND OUT then scroll ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN"
your brain is too big phantom
Also it's ok your not the first person to not know about using the miscinfo tab lmfao
I don't really have a better way to call it and already noted it down at the top about the change
Sorry, I didn't read what Swift said, can someone TTS?
So you want me to tts you say waynerHmm
Cheer100 shadow: Also it's ok your not the first person to not know about using the miscinfo tab lmfao I don't really have a better way to call it and already noted it down at the top about the change People just hate reading
I would have read it but I hate reading
he just went rrrrr he didnt get to am
think it had to be confusion ty kill shrew
Most of my notes now are the premium tts voices I'm so limited here >:(
I just got shadow and kkona so we get dying and screaming
I guess I can make shadow say foods
Cheer100 shadow: fettuccine alfredo (silence) cappuccino (silence) beef burritos (silence) creme brulee (silence) croissants (silence) Crème Fraîche Meringues (silence) cheese soufflé
YEP Shadow said all those completely correctly
i love how he says creme brulee
ok cool I didnt remember if this one was laughing or yelling
do you have these on some document you copy / paste from ?
this is one of my favorites lately
Cheer100 kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,,
it's a normal thing to type
I have this conversation almost every day
I forgot how long this one was oops
can't wait to see how the bot uses that
The bot hasn't pulled any of my tts to my knowledge yet
Why would people be trying to sleep when they can watch Colosseum?
it would use way more commas
all the kkonas use a billion , and ' to space it right
D: you just took the spoon away
Now how will Espeon eat ice cream?
Cheer169  eggman: you thought you could trick me with that fake emerald, didn't you? tails: so... how did you know it wasn't the real one? sonic: tails! eggman: because you just told me, fox boy!
I guess TTS Monster doesn't support eggman and tails voices sadge
They might just be premium ones
It's not too bad considering you heal right after this I guess
Venus is a planet, of course you lose to it
What do you think Rui does after this game?
I love this sequence. You find a key to use a key to steal a key
And you let two detainees escape
Instead of .. you know... Just finding the key
I love how she just gets on the TV to be like "Yo you didn't catch them yet :( Big sad okay bye"
My buckeyes are goin to the Natty baby!
We do like TM 17 :)
Gone are the days Espeon KO'd pokemon out of love for you
Just use the Pokemon go use moves until all of her pokemon faint. It works every time
Just curious is there a reason we do the full heal first?
And full health means no fainting, in some cases
That specific teddiursa is the teddiursa they made into a shadow in XD. New lore
Maybe if it sang better it wouldn't need to cry
It would be unoptimal to miss so he doesn't do it
no fire blast this run i suppose
You know. These villains are not very smart. If they installed mantraps in their elevators they'd have been far more successful at every venture
They should hire me as a consultant
D: Plusle? But Plusle is gonna get absolutely murdered
lol this is a fun exploit
Also, I like how in XD it's clear they renovated this lab and changed it to be more secure
But it's still the same structure
Also. That brings an interesting point. Who the hell is a construction contractor in this region?
whomever they are, they don't ask questions
"What's that? You want a giant pyramid laboratory base with a giant generator at the top that can be overvolted by pressing a button over and over?
Ohhh. I didn't even register the fact that you just took all the pokes out of your party
Like I give them a pass with Relagem tower. Since there's the casino cover business
And a giant colosseum which is tourism and entertainment
And like... Who built the deep colosseum and was like "Yes. Giant pit under a giant city in a ravine under the city where there's no sunlight. OSHA approved"
You know. I just had a cool idea for a game mechanic I want them to implement now
If you use a move that steals Keckleon's held item it should get an instant +10 boost to all stats
Drat the run had to end this way
That would have activated Blaze :)
Unfortunately it also can't use moves
Umbreon destined to be in the box forever
Ahh okay I see what you mean by the targeting now
When have I ever steered you wrong?
Raikou considered Quick Attack but didn't consider Strong Style
This now breaks my staying up time this yr.
We all need to stay up
Ok Ty it's all on you
I’m not streaming tonight I’m going to bed
damn come back and run o7
ima try n lurk snooze sleep so talk a lot ok mr strimmer?
Uhm I can't help but notice a high discrepancy
Who runs TP .. for fun?
What's up? Taking a break from math because something is wrong with my formula XD
That's like paying taxes for fun
It's better than me who is really tempted to try a 100% no hit run
So I'm gonna say I'm gonna lurk so I can work on my project but I probably won't actually work on it or actually lurk
for emerald I added type shuffle, so all fire poke would be rock for example
did you see how lopez attempts went?
cant wait to die to a ice trap and everyone o7 also KEKW
Paper Mario is where runners go to experience hell
yeah, that does rhyme well PrideLaugh
if it burns my ears, yeah ohheyi30Hehe
Fire does that too but it doesn't rhyme
extract the oil and take a bath in it
I played the Switch game when that came out
i played master duel like 3 days ago it was still shit KEKW
I stopped playing Pokemon TCG around the Unova sets
dont think i could get back into yugioh nowadays. looks too crazy compared to back then
I used to play a Serperior heal deck and then an elektross energy recovery deck
i am just so done with yugioh
YuGiOh isn't a game, it's an introductory competitive law class
It's all about who can summon Barrone the fastest and then win. Anything else isn't playing it's just goofing around
Yeah Yu-Gi-Oh right now is rather crazy with how the decks now are
Most decks is just half handtraps and then your engine of choice
I think we need to pull the Pokemon strategy. Do a one time ban of everything and then slowly reintroduce things so the game is reasonably paced again
Blue Eyes is set to get some new supports soon
I get it. They want tournaments to be quick, but two turn win or scoop isn't fun
But you don't get it! Their eyes were blue!!
idk what my fav deck is anymore
A link 1 and a few new tuners/synchro Ultimate Dragon and a XYZ
New Ultimate Dragon is flipped stats from ultimate dragon
Which allows Blue Eyes to run Crimson Dragon
Just got out the most difficult shower I've ever taken
D: that beast is so twilight
That targets something with a level on your field sends itself back to extra and then summons a dragon synchro from extra with the monster whose level you targeted
Yoooo let's go I love using the Crimson dragon for decks that never used the signer dragons ever
uh oh phantom is on that tp glitchless grind
And it counts as a synchro summon so it bypasses all the summon restrictions
And new Blue Eyes can summon both it's new synchro ultimate dragon and CD easily
Basically, you can get a free Quasar dragon which normally requires an accel synchro and has to be synchro'd but Crimson cheats it out as long as you can summon it and any other level 12
Which lets you put out another level 12 Dragón Synchro most often being either Cosmic Quasar or Stardust Sifr
It's not toxic because they used lead free paint
Dark Magician really needs that level of support
And because it returns to ED, you can just summon it again next turn assuming you haven't lost by then
Mostly just the metalmorph stuff that helps to bond both it and Flame Swordsman together
Dark Magician is just too easily interrupted with modern decks shitting out handtraps like Ash or Called by
Blue Eyes monster: "Once per turn, you can force your opponent to forfeit. This effect and it's activation cannot be negated". Red Eyes: "Once per duel; Increase this cards attack points by 1, then your opponent gains 10,000 life points"
Because handtraps are basically half the deck now
Ash, Droll, Infinite, Maxx C, etc.
Yeah Mulcharmy and Maxx C together is cancer
Because if you don't deck them out they will reload their deck
Because Mulcharmy will force your hand to return to max size while sending the rest of the cards back into the deck
At least Maxx C is limited to 2 in the OCG
I love when my opponent throws a maxx C right before I summon 3 trickstar lycrois
More or less Yu-Gi-Oh right now aims to prevent the other player from playing the game
Because they want tournaments to be quicker
And if you can FTK even bettee
Just take 6 prizes in a single attack
Could totally reach there...he just had to jump
me going to sleep   have fun and good lucky phantom
mark is going to give me our wii so ill be learning this run soon o7
i loved this game so much as a kid it was the first one i tried to play as fast as possible
time save for next run YEP
cant believe they made a whole game from that smash stage
I see a lot of gold
i will say i am learning more about the game
D: That was my favorite eldin bridge
@Zeliversal I hear you could get lucky in Hyrules version of the Ikea market, they make new ones regularly KappaPride
tippiLurk gl with the run tippiLove
these 2 bugs are quite literally positioned to be a pain in the neck
honestly? couldve just repositioned them - there's 2 wide fields
coulda put one by the owl statue as like a mental "ahaaaa!" once ya then get domrod
so as to encourage having seen them and such
like - ik HD cut some of them out, but cutting them out to me feels like the silliest of solutions when MQ OoT (even if in sections very awkwardly) showed slight repositionings as a solution
I never made it past the temple and the volcano
Forest temple / Death mountain ya mean ilsolaro? tippiTap
if I were to, from asthetic I'd give AG, GM and CitS in that order their slots in this, from gameplay tie-in to visuals it'd be AG, Snowpeak and CitS in that order
with Snowpeak taking the "this is hilariously dumn for a zelda game" spot
I get that and also the not inherently intuitive controls of certain things inside of it
but I do like how it behaves despite that
in repetition, 100% Snowpeak is the worst if you dont know jack about how to cheese some things
cus then you're on a very extended and exhausted railroad
not just the HP chest, that one I give a pass - I more mean the extended "I know this happens now, but round and round i go"
for all respective forced roundabouts you gotta take
like - it encourages thinking vastly out of the box to the point where you can accidentally break into the other spheres of "planned pathing"
these 2 bulblin up there are my biggest enemies btw
ever since I did the cheevos for this KEKW
She got her licenses from a inside a cereal box, give her a chance
aw man you skipped the cutscene where Link looks at Telma's tits twice oranLUL
silly question btw, phantom, derpy curiosity: what in videogames ya think takes up the most space? models, graphics, cutscene related things?
Also whatcha submitting for Speedtember this year? oranMonka
I would then be thinking of prerecorded cutscenes rather then ingame render - ingame render is code which is nothing for itself really
The longer the better tbh LOL
Oh this year slots will be 12 hour streams for 4-5 days, starting in the day and ending in the night.
But submissions are open till May so you got a lot of time
I would hazard a uninformed guess in times for glundo TP are in the 9 to 10hr range, yea? if you're zoomies?
oh huh, I thought its a wee bit more KEKW makes sense though
also makes me decently happy then given glundo is essentially zoomies casual hundo which I think I had like a 11hr file save at entrance to final fights like one time?
obv. thats not really anything to go by + not single sitting run and shit, but it rly does sound like glundo then is just "do that but very much so more planned and better"
hear me out: its not OoT water temple
the water dungeon is almost always the best dungeon in the game
except this one I think snowpeak is better
But I HAVE played this game
I hope you're well swift PrideLaugh
I need a guide every time for this one
@Jonxhas I am good hbu tippiSway
@Swiftalu for once more then just living, I actually feel not void KEKW
i need a guide whenever i do water, great bay, or lakebed, and any others i'm forgetting
AFTER YOU JUST SAID THAT IT WASN'T THAT BAD
GBT for me is sadly down to like 8 minutes now 😅
I played WAY too much MMRando
the most "ohhh" to me out of the 3 examples
I mean at least this isn't the sky temple shit
God that dungeon is ass too
top 3 dungeons in zelda series
That dungeon is the most frustrating one for me
1. snowpeak 2. temple of time 3. great bay temple
I love the design of it I just hate ball chain
GBT the temple is pretty cool, but GBT the experience is brought down by its bosses
I still like Snowpeak, you saw me putting it just behind AG for overall feels and vibes
its peak "haha lmao me silly" the dungeon
I do find it funny cause I recently replayed this game and it was such a breath of fresh air after skyward sword lmfao
WHY DID THEY MOVE BACKWARDS LOL
That's fair but I didn't mind that
you just reminded me of the pain when I was on 59/60 poes
I just waited and scrolled twitter or somethin
I literally SCOURED THE FUCKIN WORLD WAITING 10MIN EACH TIME FOR NIGHT
just do that during a run
temple of time and day/night? KEKW
literally like going to OGC in OoT
and I didnt think of it casually like ever that thats a thing which happens
hell, bulblin camp suffices for that too
"just go back there when ya need night time" never occured to me
I like spending 3 minutes going to arbiter's again instead of spending 4 minutes waiting for night
If you're phantom, then who's Ganon Sus
and fun fact that does NOT work on Wii 1.0
saving and quitting in Palace of Twilight also sets it to night time
@RubixTheSlime totally not me over here internally crying over memories of sitting there for over 4 real hours scouring hyrule for poes
Everyone here is the same person
It's the same for me as well
draconifs on my end is slightly lighter on the blue then mine
i can help the color problem
its the same overall range my non-trained eye would say, just a different shade of dark
That is copyright and theft and I will not stand for it
but can you sit for it?
there needs to be an enemy named bob
Yeah that's right I'm stealing colors too SirMad
@Draconif but there is, they are just called BOB-Omb
and they are in Mario games
one of the helemasaurs in lakebed named jake
but they sure as hell (in this one at least) love to be proactive
and that one cave where you deal with them loves to be painful KEKW
which honestly I dont recall if it has a heart piece or not, but I always went and did that one casually
fuck knows why if there isnt a heart piece there
not the worst enemy in zelda, the worst enemy is game controller from skyward sword
I think the freezard blocking the boss key in snowpeak should have a name
it kills me more than any other
eventually I will do glitchless again
in 2014 I did any% and a couple of all dungeons. in 2016 I did glitchless
and now for morpheel to take a swim at the ceiling
I think this wasnt even the worst
could have been one more random circle
imagine that cursed RNG where you get a 3minute cutscene for morpheel being unable to path to here KEKW
if you can manipulate RNG during the cutscene in any way, that makes me want to make a TAS of just Morpheel taking literal minutes
ya would truly wish that these 3rd party nonsense claims would not be okay ye
"who's ready for DMCA? this song will--" *cut to ad*
I suddenly feel bad for loving this song. dropBlind
you dont have to feel bad for that
time to see if a certain piece of bridge will again show us weird collision KEKW
i love those keese, or at least the way they taste
just give me the signal next run and i'll run ahead to take care of them
I mean - leathery texture has to be part of it
Link out here wanting to give up again up here KEKW
he nearly went under that bridge again!
"i forgor how my legs work"
I saw him think about sticking his head under it KEKW
and I BET the reason is silly simple
the bridges are as suggestive as the gates
the bridge isnt a single piece object model-wise
but each bridge segment is its own
as in "one bigger model, but separate pieces with lil gaps in the floor"
and then ya apply the wind jostling it about to the mix and you get "oh its not a platform during this frame"
either cus too high or too low or too weirdly angled during the cycle
ya should just model a piece of bridge like that more like say, a carpet or a cape really
you an apply textures to it to make it be seethrough where ya need it no prob
just - make it internally be more cape / carpet like
or maybe just like 3 total cuboids
more thinking one slim cuboid and then ya apply animation-cycle based deformations to it
which you can then line up with where you want the pieces of the wooden bridge (this instance) to be
actual cloth like physics I would assume could pose hassles in other places if you have that overall type of object elsewhere as like curtains as an example
"what if the player all of a sudden can walk up vertical pieces of cloth" and shit
*makes a game entirely out of cloth collisions and billboarded models*
You can time it pretty easily
Its like right before link jumps the gap
shame this is glitchless, this cutscene but human link is my favorite
there is but it takes 2 hours
i've seen it done before, idk where
and when would Low% get MS
low% gets master like like any% does
wolf link taming epona is a close second
Yeah that one is pretty hype
I'm excited for that when I run 100%
"human link pulls the master sword" only wins because you can fully see what's going on
actually, i think my favorite glitched cutscene of all is hitting the goron mask right as you return deku princess
I just love the theme of Snowpeak a lot
the effect is small and simple, but amusing. deku princess cranes her neck to look you in the face but the monkey just stares at your crotch
Exploring an abandoned military outpost is really cool
@RubixTheSlime belly button camera is strong
and funnier with goron then with zora I bet
You know I never thought about that, this is the only 3D Zelda like that too
i discovered it on accident and nearly died laughing
in Skyward sword your only bomb "drops" are from plucking bomb flowers
You get drops in Skyward Sword
musta forgotten those then, cus like - early in it feels so low in how often ya get them that my brain always just filled back up
and "later on" you really dont care much anymore cus you can have extra pouches if you want to
I do really like that feature in Skyward Sword though, plucking the bomb flowers and being able to store them later
or "shoot an arrow and be able to recover it if its in the wall"
how do you grow those things domestically, asking for a friend
which I dunno if skyward sword did that, but wanna say TP and Windwaker do both allow you that
Yo that happened to me the other day when my shield was on fire and I lost my shield due to it
Nah I didn't bother at that point
Since it technically wasn't really needed for anything
Its actually faster to roll up the stairs there
the stars aren't a slope so it doesn't kill your roll speed
Right before the key, you took the ramp
its also faster to do whatever TAS does
Yeah the Redead kill here actually surprised me when I saw Beest's strat for it
I knew I was a Tall Ass Stepbro
Don't worry Link, you can quickspin when you feel like it
I've found that rotating the stick slower than you think makes quickspinning more consistent
poe not be cringe challenge: impossible
invisible maze rooms not be cringe challenge: more impossible
link: "aight imma just put this spinner thing in my pocket"
not all the way in the corner though. just the general left wall
the spinner is def one of my fav tools
I've watched too much 100% I questioned why you ignored the poe
imagine if there was a random furry you could transform in front of
i for one would probably sleep better knowing the wolf that keeps running through town is actually just a human
i'd also be very jealous of the shapeshifting power
i want to be like yeto when i grow up
Yeto's basically the "eh whatever" person, lets you in his house and everything
who knew that bombs and jobs had so much in common
ball & chain makes block puzzles so much better
chillfos giving skyword sword game controller a run for its money
If you pb I will shove a turkey up my bunghole
I will not send proof you degenerate bastard
also who said anything about sending proof other then you Pichu? KEKW
did you hit the one spot where its a problem KEKW
Snowpeak heard you had a chill time so far
but the repairs are another 200 no? KEKW
Yeto and Yeta are into lock play
they keep a safety key in the chapel because you gotta unhorny to get to it
dont get trolled too hard by the game
does the golden cock taste like chicken, gold, or cock?
in other news, my medicine has worn off
I'm convinced most streamers are just torsos
must attend glubbers's run on GDQ
but also came to say i dressed up as link for halloween in 2015
if streamers are torsos to the viewers, what are viewers to the streamer
no way, i dressed up as link for a different even in 2016
would it force me to go live if you answered my knock one of these times
That'd be very funny if it did
i even sewed my own hat, and hennaed a triforce on my hand
i cant even chat so :(
i don't watch much gdq these days
Their chat is understandably sub only during the main events lol
aka only if i specifically plan it for someone i know
And that's been it so far lmao
i haven't seen any of this week lmao
I also really only watch it when its someone i know
i watched the no a button press SM64 run, that was cool
I watched the opening Pikmin run
I haven't watched gdq runs in a while
after going to one in 2019 it's just not the same
though maybe i'll watch back some things
i'd love to go some day, but money
I'll watch friends' runs but I won't go out of my way to watch it
or a game I really like
if mark and i didnt have to leave on thursday we were gonna be taking shots, so there was no watching runs
I always kill the lizalfos with bomb arrows on the first trip
makes the 2nd trip so much less annoying
you can do it pretty fast if you group them together
Seems the game was done in time for a stream. GLHF
why doesnt the statue roll when you roll. inaccurate movement, game literally unplayable
the statue also 1 shots the lizalfos
I think the statue should explode if link dies
where do i get a dominion rod that's bedroom compatible
also is there a submission rod
in this context it's a 1 shot. I think it does 10 hearts
the order is up, left, down right, up right, left, up left
but snowpeak is the coolest. peak gaming
AG can be a little dry sometimes
hey would you like a yellow rupee
that's TAS RNG manip levels of rupees
so that's where my order got held up at
i'll never order from Malo Express again
there's a guarnateed arrow drop in the alley by that one boko near the house
until you need rupee, then only arrow
ilia is supposed to be a major character yet restoring her memory is not mandatory
I think it's the other side
you do have to restore it
you do get the sky book though because you need it for the horse call
but that is in your inventory forever
just imagining how hated TP would be if you had to do this part without fast travel
it's much more enjoyable in glundo since you're doing stuff along the skybook
you even do cave of ordeals in the middle of it
Link: yo check out what i can do with my rod
we would need exactly 1 golden bug
what are the points of Ooccoos?
Did you pay your city taxes?
What is that little screen tho?
So which colosseum is your favorite?
i used to make Luke (my other brother) play this part for me because the hands made me anxious
Anyone here have a turkey they don't want?
i cant wait for my first run of this game to take 10hrs
Is this the best room in the game I see
@monado I'm gonna shove Patrick up your ass based on that comment
Look if I shove Mr krabs or SpongeBob it's just a guilty pleasure
I'll give you something to stare at Zeli, I promise I won't find it rude
Remind me to never learn glitchless if I get the itch
Glitchless is unironically a lot of fun
Can't do it if I don't run it
If I tell you its Pikmin I'd be lying to you
And I don't think you want that
Then I find it rude SirMad
I do have some good news for you Zeli
You can't fix this with an emote of cute Pikmin
what if I told you there's news of more Pikmin emotes being made
I'd say you tell me a lot of things and only some have been true
Most is a subset of some
Learning Palace isn't too bad tbf
If you learn stuff in Palace
You get it over with faster
I could also go drink some milk
It better have milk and not water
You could also play some Pikmin, but you won't
I'm gonna get my cereal (if you thought I was gonna say cum I'm judging you you degenerate pig Stare )
Holy shit, feels like you just had her
link open the door please can we not fight anymore
how the hell did that not hit
I swear to God and God knows, if you ask for proof about shoving a turkey up my ass I'll go up there and shove it up yours
what the Hell are y'all talking about in chat
Yeah well I didn't expect you'd actually be able to
Buff00n help me out of this I beg
They want Pic or didn't happen
GamesBot with the "Good luck" IMMEDIATELY after Phantom explains the bird going up someone's ass
Wouldn't be the first time a bot fucks me over
Or on this platform for that matter
I mean, you've threatened to fuck yourself over, so
Oh it's not even close to the shit I do say when I'm unhinged
i dreamt that i watched a documentary about a guy who had a fetish of shoving things up his colon
SwiftPichu_: Wouldn't be the first time a bot fucks
@stalkor if it was lasagna that was swiftpikachu_
chat, would YOU fuck a robot ?
Head is head, regardless of the source
we're on the same page, then
@buff00n yes but only in the communication port
do i get a spoon and eat chocolate icecream out of the container
i think its a Pennsylvania thing
I was attempting some Mario Party 9 solo mode for a sub 2:40 time
and errr, the run was absolutely apocalyptic
we're waiting to see if Swift has to stuff a turkey up their ass
I do not think I could’ve had a slower win on the last 3 boards
he really kicked that ball back at you
I genuinely wonder how mathematically improbable that run was
Get down from there Zelda monadoA
cant wait for the ER convo: “hi. whats the problem?” swift:”i stuffed a turkey” ER:”ok…then why are you here” Swift:”well….”
they must be cool ranch flavored
did you just say Cool Ranch is bad ?
I haven't even had cool ranch so no debate from me here
Yeah México doesn't have the same variety in snacks
No phantom tequila isn't a snack
But most of mexico's snacks is unironically insects
You're not fucking Ganondorf, Ganondorf is fucking you
I don't know the inside out of horseback dorf, most I know I hold up right KEKW
Too many swifts and swiftalu for me is the real swift
DARK LORD OBLITERATED BY BLUE TWINK
I'll send you a rotisserie Chicken
imagine being a red head and a twink.
I trust you'll figure out the rest
You cheap bitch at least give me a good turkey
it's $5 chicken, nice and juicy
You can watch glub when it's out from gdq
It was closer to 45, but yeah needed to squeeze the donos as usual
should have put on the iron boots
And why do I have a feeling ano has a time
Not as bad of a time, those used to he old hundo times
thank god. the fishing here is so non existent
Now if you turn over to oot, they have hylian loach rta
Yeah but this game is more serious than oot
They don't call extensions meme categories for nothing
I love staring at a rupee for like 13 hours
Yeah because ano is the only one I know who has done low transforms
low% you mean sit and stare at a rupie%
To be fair low% seems good for a subathon
Or other shit while it's going
Swiftike did a run a few years ago
doesnt low% have that 3 hour wait?
Ike did a low% run which was basically him losing at Mario kart
I've a feeling you'd like glundo more than this
i've already thought about doing glundo because it looks fun
i guess it would depend on whats faster
Low% in pape I feel there needs to be a warp or something
Did your bot just say yes but also no
so then what if you get bow.
I am, SO bloody tired, outta nowhere
I got someone doing yu gi oh if you want
did Link go to find a way home to his redhead gf ?
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your weekend
I will not shove anything up my ass
Yoy! phanto274Wave phanto274Smile  and phanto274GL trying for a phanto274Gold
I love this music so much musica23Mvgdance
Brings back a ton of memories
btw phantom what do you use for your on screen chat
I might give that a shot as well. not super happy with what I'm currently using for onscreen chat
do you just remember what stats you need for it to be a range?
or do you have a tool that tells you that?
that may be the last part of this run that is good
he's not slow, he's just living life at his own pace
that's why his hidden power is ice, because it doesn't move fast enough to heat up to any reasonable amount
and just like that I already have SGDQ week off
Oh I get it. Because the move is confusion
a modest quilava moseying his way through orre
wow a modest Quilava in this day and age? what a world
thansk for the hoothoot rand amish
I do what I can *tips hat*
Okay Quilava what are you doing
i mean i'd expect nothing lese with that speed IV
But you don't have FW so idk
terriermon should be on the bed peache114Angy
You know what, I take what I said back
Im good, I redeemed for someone to play prime 1 rando. I let them roll it and it was god awful LUL
Why do you catch the Meditite?
waow we have an espeon and quilava tracker so i don't even have to ask
The umbreon remains a mystery tho
Can’t crit it it’s in the ball EZ
I missed an if in there but I’m sure it makes sense
How many x specials do you typically use in a run?
"I'll take your entire stock" intensities
Memir B and his Ludicolo squad
They be dancing in the rain so casually.
duking was told about leg day once, but what are legs if not lower arms, so he worked out his arms more
When your arms hang that low they’re legs
mark literally just told me I wasn’t allowed to take this game when I took the Wii today
Ay, you got my name right first try!
Oh so he talks about me does he lmao
That Espeon’s defense was looking a bit too high
@Sanaerys_ i talk about you on stream when i talk to you does that count
I need to go finish setting up my splits for tp glitchless
@TheGlubbers I don't know, I was just being stupid- I mean funny
@TheGlubbers ty ty, it's the depression /jk
So Rash is guaranteed no matter what IV you are
that hitmontop is angry cause he wishes that when he looked up he saw sky
I’ll be lurking. Lai made dinner, and I’m about to go into a food coma
She made fried chicken and potatoes
im leaving to meet variety for dinner in lunder 30 min
going to uvil at 5pm is gonna suck KEKW
I gotta speedrun the moment I get home. Gotta setup GDQ OBS so I can do comms for tgh the 16th lmao
I love Typhlosion! No worries, Phantom. This Typh won'tlet you down. <3
I get home at 6pm, and my appointment is for 8:45pm LMAO
that's still super easy tho ice
like comms obs is trivially fast you could get home at 8:40 and be fine KEKW
I also gotta make sure Windows 11 didn’t fuck me in the ass while I was gone
Don't look at the two missed crits and the nature.
it's funny i see the arena and immediately know "mt battle" cause maddy doing attempts at it in XD lol
Bot has been on fire lately
@lordofduh Hey thanks! I appreciate it! <3
I forgot this trainer has multiple Trapinches?!?
If you pb I'll shove my cigarette up my ass and draw a stache on my ass
Thank you! It was last Friday. PartyHat
That's why I'm confidently saying stupid shit
I'll worry once you're around venus
If you pb, I’ll also shove a cigarette up Pichus ass and draw another mustache
Ice I'm gonna draw a fucking penis in your ass
I've said turkey, finger, pencil, pen, I think cat at some point
Anything is possible with a little commitment
Phantom you’re missing out on this dinner
I think I’ve moaned like 5 times eating this chicken and potatoes
OK so Lai is the man swifNotes
After dinner like this, Lai can be whatever she wants
why's my cat so damn touch-starved
Oh hey there's the cat I shoved up my ass
Did you not dig the houndour?
If you have a slimmer thing of respect towards me I hope you read nothing KEKW
I hated this fucking trainer for so long
I won't address pikaclones as the goat
That is the fastest fight I have ever seen
Just cause it takes 2 turns and it took 1
I wonder if hundo ever uses umbreon
want to hear my favorite dumb orre-related factoid
@swiftpichu_ probably not bu no snags does
I'm just big plusle fan lmao
if you purify the roselia from XD and transfer it to another game you can give a seel a kiss from a roselia
Being alive in a Colo run is a blessing
fave guy is beaten on pace?
cause that's the only way for roselia to learn sweet kiss
That strat is slow but is such a good backup for stuff like this
We love plusle in this house
tippiLurk phanto274Lurk rhacodLurk while having dinner
I see my personal nightmare so ty for pointing
Love this game hope runs going good natsunamiRave2
All part of the plusle experience
I've liked minun more than plusle
Fun fact no matter what iv/nat combo that plusle is it will always outspeed, because those geodudes have 19 speed lol
What about the old man who used pikachu he was pretty rad lol
Give the old folks a breaks
I'm waiting for phantom to get the Pikachu win
Plot armor pikachu is always clippable
Hell yeah, losing to Venus. that’s the spirit
You gotta pb for pichus sake
There’s a cigarette on the line
Ice I swear to God I'm gonna stick my finger so deep it's gonna look like I have you as my puppet
You'd need more than a finger if you're promising that, Pichu
Just know that I’m drinking 2 gallons of milk the day before
I'm afraid a whole fist is just kink
And I am very lactose intolerant
It's fine I'll eat taco bell
what are y'all threatening each other with in chat
I really hope you PB so you submit this run with this chat
I think Ryz's notes have backup for if catty dies, but my notes should have it too
Swift let phantom's run die, please KEKW
Wait are you doing fast banette?
psychic blaze kicked in there Pog
Or it might be for lab death idr, but they weren't when I last used them
That's the spirit! Keep the run alive!
I even have a bunch of safety stuff in play as those notes are meant for safety
Yea you might want my notes then
If you hate being safe I also have a version that's got no safety stuff
Do what all of us do, just play Pokemon Unite
Pokemon Lets go and unite are so dope
Ice, that's a MARGAINLY worse idea
Of course Buff, but hear me out
Open some packs in Pocket phanto274Smile
I like watching a friend be toxic in Unite, but I don't do team games
Rider Nelis, the streets are curious about what you be riding?
this thing has been Fire Blasting too well Susge
Back to the lab again isolar2Catjam
big dumb idiots don’t know you have protect
Oh you are doing lab death
Maybe I should write notes, I like using Zeke notes but they have 0 hand holding (Which is fine for me tbh)
I did not cause I assumed you'd go for maku catch no lab death
Ok maybe I do consider writing notes then
done with dinner and we dont do safe
I just like how I write notes better (I am biased)
and that's still the safer pape run
I will shrimply write lab death note
I will shrimply make it speed guides live compatible 🤌
Yea tho I assume it doesn't translate the exact same as google sheets where I used ~pretty colors~
Oh the double protect I like that one
Might have found out another thing I may need to edit/check with the damage formula woo hoo!
It's that I realized it's type1x type2 and not (type1 x type2)
love how they used the 64 models here
Anyways yea so in the formula rather than being in parathensis it's just multiplied with everything else which can matter if your number ends up being a decimal
Beat Venus at a hefty cost of time
It would be off by 1-2 at most
There's a heal machine down when you walk towards venus yea
I have no idea wat Rhydon is about to do
But you're probably right it probably does toxic, just like crobat protects
It all comes down to this
20 levels under wil do that
This run is in shambles now.
I can do damage formula stuff I got you
Don't trust showdown I've learned lol
I had a disagreement with showdown on a calc yesterday and I was right
Oh you know what there was a heracross fight that had 0 iv set
I think it might be this one
There should be stats on the side too
Oh fuck yes I don't have to lube up the cig
Odd I'm getting the same stats for 0 iv neutral heracross
you can't just ask that of a streamer
You be nerds, I'll watch football
Also make sure it's set to Advance generation
I'm watching rams vs vikings bitch
If not then fate doesn't want you
also what are we nerding about, I'll take that any day over american football aka Spend More Time Between Plays Than Actual Action
Or hear me out, you can burn rng while doing laundry
The short of it is you got a bulky heracross but also yea the sheet misguided hard
That is the only one I know of yes
I did copy the data over it was pointed out before long ago so I’ll fix it
Hope the RNG is with us this time
Most optimal run: Always hit fire blast, don't get KO'd. EZ
I am the devil's advocate yes
had to pop out for a bit, how did the run die? Make it to Realgam Coliseum?
Pray for good RNG idk lol
Damn that’s wild it kept trucking
I saw Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare tonight
All we are missing is the Water/Ghost starter
Since there's no starter with that combination yet
Man, even speedrunning Colloseum is difficult
I watched a video of someone getting every shadow shiny with RNG manips and I thought, “Speedrun maniping doesn’t look too bad right now”
Trying to think of my favorite Pokémon from every region
Either Spheal or Sceptile for 3
phanto274GG got a decent run off the ground at least
GL on your runs Phantom phanto274GL
phantom is always good and awsm orange a great member.
I shared it in #suggestions today
also icebound said everdrive pape is possible, it will just take time
im just glad to know it can be done
pape rando discord is doing a pape only AP async, we have 8 people lol
I learned today with dk64r there is a tracker that can display the song playing if its a dev branch seed
peache114Yawn  guess who just crawled out of bed
im living  in shame axl leave me be
RNG on your side tonight with that pull
I’m going to attempt it again tonight lol
I need to look at Glubs video again cuz it wasn’t clicking
Yeah I just need to stand in the same spot then figure out the visual cue from there
satellite u sacrifice a panel of ur or opponents
and it gattling guns 2 boxes ahead
During your time did you work on any projects that got leaked
I was watching Kit and Krysta talk about their experience so was curious
the soundtrack is a banger NODDERS
school comp goes way too hard
how much damg does it do? 15?
youll save time if you draw it on iceman
ive seen dalus do it a few times
lmao im not really listening more lurking bcuz im working on  vods and all i hear is "when you go shopping with a girl and she wont shut up"lmao
do you run faster when running against the walls?
why is it called power plant when it's not plant power
ALL UR BASE R BELONG TO US
Darn it was a great one
Doing AP with pape, how do i turn on auto tracker?
gotcha ill just do it manually then no worries
if you pb I'll shove my UI goku funko up my ass
Looks like I'll be in vegas again in the summer lol
Evo is doing official side-games with full medals and shit and kof was announced first
I'm planning it out with mn friends rn
Also top 8 is back thank god
battle network chads who up for some late night gaming
Don't worry woman also walk away from me
Maybe the game thinks you do
Glad you enjoyed the vomit formula in sheets sixeTada
I should probably consider getting a job doing excel sheets lmfao
I love making stuff like that so yes I would
Hopefully no terrible game bugs to prevent a phanto274Gold
Ayo, gl hf on the run(s)!
Haven't got any yet, but good to know
Done with duties time to enjoy a stream
Capcom's favorite BN character is Mr. Match LUL
Isn't there, like, some kind of super niche competitive scene for some of the BN games?
is that based on the actual charracter or the just the design?
BN6 has an online scene, they found a way to play online thanks to the GBA wireless adapter
hello escape, nice to see you this encounter
ermm... i meant to say "BN3 Resetter" KEKW
but yeah i used to watch symes
Ive been around, hell ive been following erothaur and kilios for over 10 years
Yo what's up man (of mega)?
an RNG manip in a battle network is precise?!? no way i don't believe that at all
If you pb I will shove mirby up my ass
KEKW i come back to that message
We're a veeeery long way from having a beef
spare a chat member a subspace emissary run in the future?
BN is the best game man. Never gets old.
Don't threaten me with a good time
I'm an x/zero fan and I hate BN
Motherfucker do you not remember my first BN game was network transmission?
I'm not an X fan, but I am a MMZ fan
I'm sorry I take it back
It is cool, but it's extremely fucking jank
twas ok, tho i died all my runs lmao
hes playing jp version so no lmao
@peachedpocky I know, but let me dream
Alright, imma head out though. Goodluck with the MegaMan Battle Network 532 run calami29Boingus3
I ask myself that question everyday, for 23 years.
Or even worse, a degen psychic
think you meant to spell psycho
If I was a psycho I wouldn't be here
One thing is talking shit and another doing shit
Yes that’s right it was all my luck
Why not start with the first game though lol
Start with 2 and play 1 later, or just skip 1?
Why is that dude passed out LMAO
he was just laying on the road
I have to run my laundry is done lol. Good luck with the rest phanto274Smile
Spaghetti I havent eaten in 2 months
Yeah but I just got back and needed to express myself
Probably sit in vc later tonight or tomorrow so we can talk about this run
i always giggle when you kill one of them as they move cause the smear sprite
i did my first timed segemt of tp
yeah i got to faron twilight at 31:46
Great 1st hr but alas din time gonna phanto274Lurk tippiLurk rhacodLurk
you should play a non-rng game like colosseum :)
just get the right frame 1st try
also i just saw that message you sent do all friends :)
surely they got 7 hours to spare
i found it funny you got 2 escapes in battle 2
like it really wanted you to get out
"even we know this encounter is trash, go on, get out of here"
i was actually gonna suggest myth KEKW
you played tales of graces f at all?
the remastered is out today been having fun re playing it
Hey Phantom, did you know 0.01 CAD equals 0.069 USD? isnt that so nice?
i couldve just said 7 cents yeah but this is funnier
I accidentally clicked on the stream and had my phone in my lap
We all hate BN1, welcome to the club
it have 1 of the best combat system people have said they don't like the story but i like the story
and suddenly heard voices talking about the 0.069 American cents, and axelhad JUST finished messaging me abt jt
so I thought I was hearing shit
al I know is vesperia is one of the better ones, never played it tho... this is the xbox 360 exclusive right?
vesperia combat is good but i think the game sucks
@Axl_SR ps3 in jp only also then ps4 and pc switch too i think
Xillia 1 is what got me into tales
I like graces f a lot too
or just get the ps5 version of graces
I have graces f ps3 physical
funny thing is you get the grade shop right away and its max out you can start with anything on if you want
I heard what digital foundry said
Ttyd remake is bad for speedruns too. But i still feel it's a good remake otherwise
i got returns just so I can play it on arcade stick like I did with tropical freeze
just a fun silly way to revisit
@iceblue My new audio technia headphones are limited edition ice blue LUL
Hideki Kamiya saying Switch 2 leakers need to be destroyed is so real
are we gonna find fast guage in the bed comp again?
ice, its the same as bn2 style skip if you're aware of that one too
I just got here to open the folder cloae the folder open the folder open the folder
can't you not jack out in power plant?
did you see how jugoombas bn5 runs went today?
All I caught was reset on knightman fight cause no drilarm1
and what do those get you
there is a free backup in scilab comp
then you do the Chip Gate ASE instead Kappa
the best way for ice to learn this is to run it himself KEKW
I don't know how it works, only that the result is you flip the bits for the complete flags to unlock gold duo
I still don't have them all in this game
we gonna see the TalkToDesk manip?
lemme guess, you only get $2.50 of it still
Ice, did you know Ms. Mari has a twin sister? So if you left her kidnapped no one would ever know LUL
so chips are more likely to appear in their original spot
Every 64 in game steps there is an encounter check, the first few hundred steps the chance is 0%, then every other encounter check it increases 3% > 6% > 9% until around 45% or 49%, then its just a matter of how many coin flips you win.
I find 43 funnier than 69 LUL
Smog made an alphabet soup emote LUL
if only Escape J+K+L was a PA
you escape but also get a reward
you escape and then turn off encounters until you jack out
not true, you go to school to use the subway Keepo
oh hell fuckin yeah ice, you already know
these fish guys have hype animations
If you pb I'll shove this fish so deep up my ass I'll float
oy that the nerd i was just chatting with in discord :P
it's okay he had his music
also i find it funny that the anime makes the kid an entire unique character and part of the group
why is it called water comp when we're not compensated for it
elec man scenario music goes crazy hard
that or the battle theme might be my favorite songs in this game
the game also cuts the encounter rate
they coded in to turn you at corners, so they clearly thought of it
it was L, you could've picked it
i tuned out after you beat up a scotsman in the oven sorry
i could read if you weren't skipping all the cutscenes
you also can't charge at all without charge 2
i still want to cosplay her at some point
just need to lose weight lol
FireMan in the dub got renamed TorchMan too lol
What is Ices knowledge of this and who is in the lead?
ice's knowledge of this run is "wow the sequel's run is better"
ice don't do that to yourself, not even at my low this morning would i be willing to torture myself that much
in the anime masa had a secret identity as leader of a crimefighting trio (with sal and miyu). his name? COMMANDER BEEF
hold on i have live footage of ice right now
the funniest part is it's perfectly in time with the BGM
i gift a sub to myself
i wanted to even out my bits lmho
Pride1 one gay bit to even mine out
v0oid has his effects all set to 69 bits so i was uneven lol
Twitch presents real american heroes. Today we salute you Mr Battle Network Speedrunner Guy. Without you we would be forced to do the unthinkable... playing BN1 ourselves. But you can finish it in under 2 hours. On with your god awful RNG you battle bad boss RNG, not drawing Escape chips, and failing polar bear skip. And why do you do it? No really, why would you play BN1? Regardless, we tip our hat Cheer100
there is a glitch to this fight, not sure how it works but protoman takes damage everytime he steps lol
is that just hitting him with spark
oh, you need clues to find WWW Area in the undernet, this leads to to Higsby memo, teacher memo, and pa memo
i like to think that those stops are still there but lan never needs to go there so he doesn't
but it's also funny to just imagine the trans were moved entirely to new lines
yeah, M-Cannon can take out the life virus aura. Good Idea
lie down. try not to cry. cry a lot.
wait, the WWW Door chip is just something you can get off an enemy?
maddy said "What?!? Guts being useful for something?!?!? BLASPHEMY"
you should head into internet 10+ for chips Kappa
invis is one of the best chip in the series
now you can redo the trader
you can even save scum it
pretty sure you can buy D Barriers at most drug stores
YO IS THIS MY FAVORITE SPORT FOOTBOMB?!?
this is the run of all time
are you comparing to sum of worst now lol
that was rough, i see why he's the final boss
Endgame and just in time about to popesTreat tippiEAT TreatCorn
GGs on the 36 minute pb
Hey Phantom! Hope you are doing well today
Too famous for your own good lol
i mean lets be honest here
when you click the RANDOMIZE button that's all it takes to ask for that
starting without boots is really fun to watch
What would be amazing is early boots
take it from me, someone who had ocarina on adult fishing in the ZOOTR she just did, and had required golden gauntlets cause she forgot to turn off trials and found out they were behind talon cucco game where the weird egg was in hyrule castle fairy fountain
although that seed also had the hilarity of having medallions set to anywhere and yet having shadow medallion be FULLY VANILLA
lordofduh called the early Kooper too
I look away for 5 seconds. I didn't even notice they got Kooper
hello I hope you are well
when do you do hotfix? I’m sure have said but I haven’t been around much lately been pretty busy
I didn’t realize when puzzles are randomized the colored boxes in the toy box are too. 😂 I have to write it down because it’s so long
Yes back in time and seems pape bonus content
there's no ice potato on me
the most precious coin in all starborn valley
I got 2 quarters in my car door
guess you need to leave traps on
my twin sister thinks it’s entertaining
I like traps. lots of instant gratification turned to rage quickly
that’s the worst it’s happened to me so many times
when is gdq hotfix? gotta make sure I tune in for support :)
I'd also tell you to fuck off
I'll join vc and you can listen to me snore and fart
yeah ill be there for support for sure friend
and gets the quake badge lol
ask for quake and you shall receive
When you get a chance after stream go post in my discord AP channel
thanks for the pie. I mean bomb
love the fuecocco plush and the plush next to him i think its an octorok
is there ever a point to d down pound
So. I can't help but point out a confusing element
Why do you need to test the rando settings before hotfix when you just hotfix them at hotfix?
Just hotfix a good end time 4Head
im thinking goombario might be here
there's still a fair amount of checks out there to get anyway
just got done yapping about all masks on hotfix which was fun
what kind of estimate are you aiming for
shame shas had to call in a substitute host but glad you had fun
it was, i played axl's reqiest game
you are cool, you are rad, and you make fun content raid
Love the skin, can you believe smash ultimate took away fire mario
i told them to say that you are cool and make good content, but thanks axl for just spelling that out
You're gonna be on GDQ? That's dope af!
hes been there a few times, he did an event a few months ago w tp rando and glubbers
right right pax, i cant differentiate events
that race was great, I took a screen cap. One of you was on final and the other was on Bowser??? witth he caption "this is such a close race" LUL
I remember you doing pokepark, based game
GaySex GaySex2 Looking why is this a emote
its always really cool to have a dev on the couch
are you doing the dumb laki trick?
speaking of Tubba's Castle key @Axl_SR
oh right @lordofduh the stream is done so ill hop in rando VC channel
the guys are waiting on my AP items LUL
im gonna lurk and grab more iced tea
oh joy where was the goomba
you don't need that many repel gels? bold call Mr 5 HP Kappa
life shrooms don't grow on trees, but apparently on bushes :o
he didn't intend to, but ended up skinny dipping
so for christmas i got a pokemon cookbook and there's a recipe for shuckle berry juice
i just ordered a milkshake from cold stone and basically just did that recipe as the milkshake lol
the recipe calls for vanilla yogurt with banana, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries with pomegranate juice. couldn't get the last bit but i just got the rest (with vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt)
yeah it's a basic smoothie mix lol. it is also tasty indeed
also i did submit a small logic update over github
easy fix, train station bushes only show in logic with bombette
I noticed during my AP this week lol
im go mode now, icebound is waiting on my koot stuff but im rushing for final now lol
WHY CAN I BLOCK CRYSTAL BITS ON BIZHAWK BUT NOT ON HARDWARE!?!?
still no tubba bubba castle key?
what are the chances of that?
don't think it's part of the rando algo to troll the runner
i have broke logic in the archi im doing so much that im beating my game in about 15mins
i dont have my light arrows
I just got a 7 cap on hallway starting at 8 dmg
got phase 1 to 69 LUL
um no cant say i have
well shit that a lot of damage
nah, I said no to GDQ lol
Brother we all know that's wishful thinking
phanto274GL on finding the ideal settings
So what was added to try and get it to the ideal length
ahhh god content hello how are doing
ist thiis new setting blitz or just a rando
what do you have on is i can ask
so basically what you were doing before but without the beta stuff you added?
your last run on gtq was have startet with suchie glich
An 🍎 a day keeps the Juniors away
what do you think mirrow mod on gtq ?
just mirror your x axis too and it's the exact same as normal :P
on the first chapter of the run woud be funny in gta is mario cant do nothing my opinient littel bit enoing but funny
i just pry of a good seed
I found you're stuff on YT the other day for the Nightmare random I just finished that a few hours ago
General Guy fused with Argorok to make a flying tank
That's I'm shoving a seed up my ass to see if I a tree can grow up
All you need in life is bitches
So how about that airline food
why do i have never think aboud that just just laki
the blocks on beach are not rando?
we have out of logig boots
hmm, so i haven't been getting emails saying you've started streaming. will unfollowing and refollowing fix that?
nop that what we dont whant
yep thats all turned on, just haven't been getting notfied at all
but i got axl's notification so i dunno
i ahve persenaly erverthing mutet dc or anithing but i guss for the gtq run i mayby wanna aktivate then
geez that top bar color is something else. gl hf o7
i go to beat lurk of phone gn
It's just for Koopa Bros actually
i mean gerneral guy was posebil but a littel bit rng
Because they can be literally unkillable
What's Rowf set to? All 5 sets?
what when are bots on mout rugget
For Chan it's Boots, Goombario, Sushie, or Watt. I suppose we could add Laki, but I think currently it's kind of like throwing a bone in regards to battle logic
Kind of brutal if you ask me
That's why I wanted to add at least Watt to GG logic, but everyone was like "let's not be too hasty here"
Right. But I think the KBF boss is the only one that's in any way likely to be that early, right?
Did you include the bombette skip for the toybox wall pre GG?
Haven't had time to look over the PR besides taking a glance
tho I noticed the bombette puzzle skip change is incorrect. Not sure if a fix before after sunday is a good idea because it's a weird edge case
Missed the start where you probably mentioned this, did you add longer BC?
Aight, curious what the time is going to be
I mean she's been in the box without refrigeration for over one hour
I dip my balls in the Burger King soda dispenser. if that offends you then you can leave this country, snowflake.
y'all were supposed to copy and paste that
my brain was so confused by this music lol
I dip my balls in the Burger King soda dispenser. if that offends you then you can leave this country, snowflake.
burger king is already gross enough
potentially, but i have to die by my slander of BK
i've had it one singular time
and i will never eat there again
the last time i had BK it was just the most digusting burger i've had
so even though i used to enjoy it i just can't anymore
i was linked to a online tool that lets you spin the world map in like all the different types of projections and i turned africa into a potato
yeah i don't think i've ever been to burger king without a catastrophic event following it
are you not gonna deliver that mail?
parakarry is going to lose his job
My moms Eagles are going to the champ game. Now its the ravens turn. GLHF on the rando madness.
iirc the koopa tower is technically still bowser, but the koopas separated are their own enemies
you found the chef of bowser's castle
if you leave now you might just starve them out
I saw a group of ants today. I saw a fucking group of ants today. And these ants were just doing their fucking thing. Ants. Ants? This lowly form of creation, ants? Ants? Do you know how ants do their thing? Do you know what it is to be an ant and do your thing? You fucking work. All day. All night. 24 hours a motherfucking day. Ants. All they know is work, that's what they exist for. The queen fucking ant, queen bee, whatever, she needs a fucking lair. Well it's time to get to work ant boys! Le
phanto274Nom ghunzoNom rhacodNom NomNom time so will be tippiLurk phanto274Lurk rhacodLurk then.
for the record that was hilarious
also i am back from finally doing a long-delayed self-care
I saw a group of ants today. I saw a fucking group of ants today. And these ants were just doing their fucking thing. Ants. Ants? This lowly form of creation, ants? Ants?

I haven't been here, what kind of settings are these?
i've always loved that this glitch makes you go "oh no junior troopa's frozen in ice! anyways"
the legendary scarf of true power
so today, because of retroachievements, i learned there's a one piece tactical RPG on original gameboy
Oh this blooper is last, huh
but still, of all genres on all systems
Go mode! (Assuming you can clear Bowser's Castle)
Should be a fairly quick endgame then
Checking the panel but not the block smh
I guess power badges were cheap?
we just don't need your go mode item in the middle of the fucking desert again
also these settings were terrible they led you to getting goombario
oh good I can actually chat now
My twitch hasn't been letting me chat for 2 hours lol
2 sets of shoes in Toad town
It's because Watt bled onto the hud
Hammer or bombette would open this seed up
Funny option would be feesh for something under a panel
What the fuck is that following you
the random BP needed for badges, I'm guessing it's a range like 0-3 more/less than vanilla and not completely random, right?
sounds like what you're saying is that randos are so random
I was just making a cringe joke
it was good, we did a lil weekly race together
with drak, levias and axl. 7 chapter, dungeon/boss rando
how's the settings for this one?
This one fuzzy will be it's new name
Bow was half off on a different shop
the idea of Bow realizing she can be bought for cheap LUL
That upgrade reminding you of a shiny new pair of shoes
what a good trick to join the stream to lmao
runs of what? nah i'm kinda of out of the loop ngl
i never could do this trick period
hitting 1s and then a 10
yo phantom! I won the race
also everdrive has arrived in my state. Did you X7 come with usb cable?
and someone else already got the SRC page so i can actually just enjoy learning to run the game instead pf stressing routing it
What's the estimate gunna be when you do the run?
whelp my Ravens 🐦‍⬛ ended 🆙 losing but enjoyed a snow ❄️y bike 🚲 ride out. how goes the finds so far? Oh a 🆕 seed.
love the closing of the eyes just then
Just to look fancy or use as a head wrap
you took the star piece from the quiz guy but not the from the tree
Bucket and scarf in the desert
will we find the goomba lord
i really hope you have to do this for the gdq seed
If only the dusty hammer could be used as a one use hammer
One use as in it'll break after and you have to go rebuy it
so far an upgrade melody and a ruins key ouch
yes on thursday so just grinding away!
i used to have wr but now i'm 4th. 2nd and 3rd have mid to low 1:13's and wr is a high 1:12
i want to get a mid 1:12 and then asses to see if I wanna do the 1:11 grind which would be about 1.5 mins from sob
yo have fun i'm gonna get my dinner that's been waiting monkaS
Maybe the hammer you're looking for is on snowman's gift...
He was here last time too
Just one position to the right
The million dollar question this seed "Does Merlow have a phanto274Ban ?"
Nah it's fine, train is here
Sadge only if  farore's wind setting was pubilc
this is so fun to watch :)
hammer behind anti guy would be funny
getting boo's portrait can't compare to this
it's not a fish, it's a mammal Kappa
rogueport news hear how does it feel to be a mario without a hammer?
At this rate it's more and more likely that Merlow had it
100+ checks surely a hammer will be one
hmm purple fire pink camo cool
i am sooo tired have fun papey sparkleYawn sparkleYawn
YES i am a mmbn enjoyer!!!!!
not enjoying MMBN makes you a bum
yeah that event we gotta be a little more less ... kinky on main LUL
i don't think helix wants us to talk about that LMFAO
@Iceblue I'm not hearing you CAN'T be freaky on main, tho
If we wanna be invited back
How much to fight Amazee Dayzee
Don't you mean vanilla Crystal King?
sorry ive been lurking and saw you got up to this boss lol
This seed has one hell of a twist when it came to the hammers
Guess where the last hammer is
Spear Guy could have lived but instead chose the afterlife by Stone hammer
only 3 screens away, bro could’ve done something
Here take this shooting star and go rescue your child yourself
he’s a yoshi, couldn’t he have eaten the m bush or something
all that for a sfx badge lol
also this seems like a fun seed
Guess where the final hammer is?
For all those who just joined us
I just guessed on those lol
I've got the stream on 5% volume yet Raven STILL hears my audio
those 1 coins are just the bee's knees huh
time to glitch into blueberry patch
I can do a few glitches but not all of them some are very hard to do
Rosie actually has something of value today
my birthday is 2 days away
you can just barely see the outline of the walk way in the dark but I can see it.
"didnt see this guy" in pitch black lol
but that is really cool you can do that without using watt
How to easily beat a Paper Mario boss: Shredder Strats
mario can walk on water it’s a miracle!
It's only been 7.5 hours and the average working day is 8-12 YEP
Just get a ✂️ and it's auto-win vs all of PapeMario
Then again Paper Mario defeated a pair of scissors
Paper Mario is the paper that beats scissors
@jc________________ then that means rock beats paper
I can’t wait to see that
ive been lurking for a while
i was doing a rando with 110 power stars but i was missing 10
goombas and koopas being the same color makes that worse
I haven’t done power stars yet. I figured when I got better that would be the time to try it.
Just use aim bot and then you can't miss
part of my concern is that the spoiler log seemed to suggest bowsers castle had power stars but I couldn't get there without all 120
um I didn’t know that’s how you did that. I thought you stood on the middle and just let bombette fall but that makes way more sense
i remember needing the last pair of boots in a jail cell in order to have the height to hit the ? blocks in the sewer
This one is a real stinker
The worst item in the game
“Where’s the key?” right fucking there I guess
that's where the key was? was it your run where the tubba blubba key was vanilla some days ago?
French vanilla in the worst way
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Today will be Chinese dim sum for me for dinner
Just had my bi-annual teeth cleaning
It's going to be 7 bp
Your pathing shorts have been really helpful btw
When I left you yesterday no hammer and still no hammer
Doesn't this combination also get you to ch5?
i just got back from running an errand. Found a USB micro, hoping thats the right one for the X7
i beat the pot centipede and got you a bubbleman chip. i'm sorry :P
did you just bomb the block and get a badge
oh i was ages behind lmfao
i was wondering if bombing blocks works in vanilla lmao
Goombario came packaged with an upgrade
just never thought to try that as a kid lmfao
Lemme know if you want jcog and me to watch out for backtracks this bad during the seed vetting
I only watched the first hour of the second run from yesterday. But I peeked the finish time, and oof
Okay, so we're looking for something not sub 3:30, but also something not completely terrible...
Super early general guy with nothing
We might need backtracking though to get anywhere near 4hrs
Early to mid game BC is the way to go probably
oh. Yeah that's awful in almost any settings
Anywho, gotta bounce, gl on the rest. Also pls send me the spoiler logs for the past 2 or 3 seeds if you still have em
Hammer does the same as Jump x1 so Jump was always better
Again berserkers aren't known for brain capacity and instead watch weapon go smash
Now we don't have to use the awkward way into 7
Doesn't help that in this case you couldn't get rid of the Tuff Puffs easily with partner
i mean.. games done quick, its in the name
Nice nice. Will definitely try to catch the hotfix. I'm glad PMR is gonna get some attention
dungeon and boss rando for pm is seems super interesting
mario: heals all the time enemy: heals at all (hes cheating)
Oh I just noticed the different bosses on the tracker, that's cool
Just finished the meat sauce and linguini and lookin pretty solid on ur finds
yeah i got it for about that much when i snagged it, friend showed me a sale that knocked it down that much lol
If it was a Watt star though
Just learned paradox pokemon in the anime just make sounds and dont actual say their names. Truly the unga bunga of pokemon anime language. Cheer100
guzzlord just screams, so its basically Goku LUL
you have mods, put there asses to work
Im telling Rigby I want your hotfix settings to be season 4 LUL
i heard something about a mod? need something
I never laughed so hard at a single emote use
id imagine youd have a better time find clean japanese audio than english
yeah I was gonna say I'm sure someone's ripped the game audio at some point
maybe not for the modern ones but certainly for the older ones.
of right, pokemon cries! My dumbass is thinking the anime cause thats what I mentioned first
Probably your favorite mons and mons you use for speedruns
cant you just rip it from the fan made pokedex apps? The ones ive used have cries
Hence why the Espeon and Quilava cries
oh pokepark would be a good starting point'
there i finally found a funny one
progressive undernet rank in ariel's grotto
what are you doing with that ariel
Vanilla bowsers castle 3 times in a row
Looks like we need to make sure that doesn't happen for your run
Enjoy this music because it's stopping now
it wasn't even C O N T E N T bad
And now back to the vanilla speedrun of Paper Mario
like a bad seed can be redeemable if it's at least entertaining in how bad it is, this was not that lol
your splits analyzer seems to be more accurate about my resets
No wonder the child was imprisoned in the castle
this game is so good and fair
holy shit 5fp power bounce lmao
honestly yeah but seeing it drain 20fp in 4 turns feels wrong lol
you sure you have enough repel gels
dylanjGG phanto274GG rhacodGG popesPOGGERS tippiWin marcoWin
great end to a ravid seed
i think being idk 70 mins under is a problem
just in time gotta go to cheer on my buckeyes in the title game
Fuck ME, it's cold as HELL
hopefully not more than 4 either
this 1 is a 407 Kappa
i oneshot woodman with a fully charged atomic fire and he left 50 rupees for you in the pile of ashes that used to be him
streamer's too cool to homeward shroom
Still fuckin worthless of a character
man pretending hes not wearing boots just so he can jump on his friend
we can *see* the boots mario
someone whisper devs, get them on the barefoot mario start sprite
If we all did 5 dollars
37 people in chat, < 3 dollars each
the fact that your "dollars" is 10k bits LOL
"hi everyone, i brought a bomb!"
You're gonna shove nuts in bloopers mouth
Have you ever considered how blooper feels?
What was he doing with those
I was wondering where I left those
Sorry I was trying to dry them
and we got to see you throw nuts at blooper
You skipped like 5 on mountain
What if you put on slow go
I can contribute 883 bits towards the cause
what did that penguin do to you
why do you keep blowing him up
is not even ONE wall in this game save?
been trying out the Going Commando AP and good lord doing endgame planets with no armor is brutal cause rn everything is vanilla damage. phanto274Cry
hey - better that then random planet difficulty making early planets a nightmare
cus I mean - R&C games all have had new game + options, so like... KEKW
i wonder if you can NG+ the AP lmao
I bet you could, just that it would not be really helpful
like - unless you wanna do nanotech level sanity that is
cus I renember up your arsenal (thats the 3rd, yea? I always forget the names and go 3 cus over here it was 1, 2, 3 and then the title which I didnt memo from there) did have another 100 nanotech levels behind that
or hell - hear me out, something which could reasonably be added from NG+ stuff: higher bolt multiplier unlocks and weapon level based checks
and then Deadlocked was the 4th which was called Gladiator in EU iirc
only had 3 as a kid, thought the series was interesting, but cus I didnt have the money to even think buying into the PS eco, it always stayed an afterthought
but yeah lotsa stuff is locked behing NG+ in UYA
going commando also does have a couple more weapon level upgrades behind NG+, no?
i forget cause i never played GC much, ik UYA does and also the RYNO is locked behind it iirc.
If you pb I'll fist Jon
@SwiftPichu_ fuck you KEKW not open for business PrideLaugh
@SwiftPichu_ I KNOW that now swifSmug
That's what I get for being degen, jon is into butt stuffing
@SwiftPichu_ that I did not say KEKW
I just said that to your degen hypthetical, I aint open for business for you KEKW
Unironically me being me has indeed backfired on me
A guy already tried to flirt with me KEKW
I was already prepared for it to backfire on me anyways
As I also knew I was gonna be banned somewhere eventually
huff'n puff chose to be of the frost kind today is all
whaaat you dont want to buy the coin? BUT IT WAS FOR ONE COIN! KEKW
Oh yeah its party city tonite! Lookin pretty solid on items on the 2nd go around
I was hoping for charmy and the "hey you found a KEYY!" one tbh KEKW
so the story of this seed: mario has soggy feet
What item is behind star pieces?
can you toss Goombario in the trash as well
that was a lot of life shrooms
ya know... I shouldnt be surprised...
but somehow seeing new kinds of "fuck walls" moves in a videogame get me despite that tippiGiggle
cmon red luigi, get up there
the setups that take this long are evil
@buff00n only because the game said so this seed PrideLaugh
Just threaten to send him to Minish Cap
i am back from the gym
So it's hard to randomize Bowser's castle location huh
Since this is the fourth time that it's in the same place
how many things do ya need in bowsers to progress?
I did see parakarry, laki, bow - didnt play this in forever, so I dont know
Think all the partners minus Watt
ahh - ya still got a good ensemble of partners required for bowsers castle though I wanna guess
glitch logic, fair either way me brain thinkin "what if the dungeon randomization goes and is silly"
I swear, I hate this fucking keyboard man
again eating what I am typing out - had it eat entire words already....
guess rando's gonn rndo w castle placement then
"hey Peaches gues what! Twilight Princess is playable in AP" "Axl! You cant just come into my stream make me drop everything and not not help me test it!!" KEKW
it became playable a few days ago, needs more time in the oven
so..... why cant you beat it......?
fowl top chest had my super boots and it didnt send, had to manually send it
also you cant really change settings either
makes me renember how sunshines AP was there for a bit, then cus of a variety of issues between 🐬 and delfino plaza state nonsense were rough and the person behind it got busy IRL no one picked that up from there >.>
being rough - my brain forgot the sentence I was typing out mid typing it seems c.c
im not sure, github i see WritingHusky at the top of the page
the bottom mentions help from lunarsoap
meanwhile me out here specifically not playing MM in AP because of that...
so the map part of your trackerr will be dead due to new logic?
@Axl_SR it should work as long as phantom doesnt also update the pack to use the new logic
and then once thats done, it again will work *shrugs*
WritingHusky...is it a bunch of awoos
but emotracker doesnt auto hook to any rando out there to pull the logic from there straight up
as it is now I can do it just fine without a map, I just like the convence of being able to pin all the hints
I mean - that you'll still be able to do regardless, unless its a new location tippiThink
how deep is the ER rabbit hole opening up, if you heard any of that
super silly question, but: ooccoo nest or some such for the per dungeon ooccoos? swifDerp
I know OoT has C buttons in the pool. You cant use the button to play the ocarina until you find it
do you use simple 64 or retro?
oh yeah there is that to lol
thank you for letting me know good luck with your gdq run
We had that happen in the last seed
That is the seed that was bad
stupid in a good way or a bad way
And Bowser's Castle being vanilla 4 times in a row
The Espeon and Quilava reset simulator
To the point where their cries are now in your memories
And no 5th Bowser's Castle is vanilla seed
Swift, have I told you that I work with rotisserie chickens ?
Good, shove one up your ass
Goombario start? This seed's gonna be ASS
What happy meal, sushi and dressing in the same place
Whelp time to pay for a feesh upgrade
Damn, hard times for squirtin'. Sheesh.
taking a break from my rando to eat I’m hungry
If it consoles you a bit, i managed to fix the partner menu cursor for the next release. Rain's fix had an off-by-one
I hate when they summon another one.
All this from a WeLoveGoombario start
Just one more to Ultra Hammer phanto274Ban iceblueBan
Yeah I've been thinking this one would've been perfect
The right kind of stupid for entertainment
Can we add 3 more of those sections
Just the right amount of silly and hopefully not sub 3:40
It was a hammer but not the right kind of hammer
I mean. We can probably bridge a bit of time after beating Bowser by talking about the rando itself. Maybe show off the doopliss easter egg
Lurking in the background listening while working out. GL!
kooper is so jacked now just like luquiid after his workout
man my brain is smooth today. i'm sitting here going "why isn't phan jumping?" ...... you don't have the boot /facepalm
calling it now, boots are on mountain pass (if you haven't been there yet)
@lordofduh is that for sure or your guess?
the boots are in jr troopas play ground
We even have the stinky pass
No way!! Bow's room without having boots, I've never seen this actually required ever, I wonder if it actually is
What would you do if that check was a progression item that you couldn't get to?
Errr i guess you must have thrown it
Lmfao someone just posted the entire Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie on twitter
This was just posted 8 hours ago. So I guess it was reuploaded
I guess I can pop some popcorn and save 93 dollars instead of going to the movies
Oh wait I forgot the drink
not gonna lie, ff15 was disappointing imo. it started strong, then kinda went downhill for me
i'm going to be brb, giving baby a bath, if boots are acquired, i'll ask about it :D
i think they are on mountain pass still
I feel like ultra hammer would be good and bad since while you could beat volcano it also opens panels
yesterday was rough my hamster decided to die on me. 🙄
Not much we can do with the cycle of life, hopefully they lived a good life
but I did get flowers and chocolate
@rgamer0 he lived 2 1/2 years and they are suppose to live about 1 1/2-2 years
okay I’m going to have you on my phone with headphones while I finish my seed
Okay maybe this jumpless time is a bit much
caaaan we get ultra boots here too
Desert with 2 boots to match with Jade Jungle's phanto274Ban iceblueBan
what happens if multiple boots are on the screen at the same time, would they just both show up as regular then switch once you picked up one of em?
I left for a few minutes where were the boots?
2 of them to be precise
Hopefully they're not filled with sand being out there
Turtle in a cloud frozen over
This seed seems to be too fast
Because now chapters will start to fall left and right
Probably a sub 3 hour finish is my guess
It feels like Bowser's Castle dips will determine how long seeds will go on for
What are we even missing for go mode, Just the chapter 6 items?
As annoying as it is isn't ruins technically beatable at this point?
their parents sure don't cause they don't spend a single second looking for them.
where were the 1st pair of boots
I take it traps were disabled after that first seed you did with these settings
those weren't in the desert argickAngry
Didn't you call UB in TB?
Toy Box being profit as usual
Gotta make sure to ask for the right water
2 levels of BP for 3 levels of FP
Welp, who knows, maybe water will just be here
Water can now just about be anywhere
So how baby was this seed
"Vanilla Ruins" sounds like a SMW level
At least you don't need to do the annoying laki teleport
Probably need progression to be placed in Bowser's Castle
So now we just need chapter 8 keys
Nope on that, we're in go
Would letters or koot do the trick for time?
6hp is especially odd since he has 10hp normally
It's probably again just put some progression into Bowser's Castle and that solves the length issue
What's the minimum requirement just to put the early parts of Bowser's Castle into logic
Sad I'm gonna miss the ending but I gotta go, cya
So they should know what a basic requirement is for the showcase
deja vu from few runs ago
I really wish I could preload FF7 on PC
gotta keep dem hackers at bay for a whole two days
why did you walk past the star points earlier?
or, no nvm it was runaway pay badge
oh ffs, I really need to play this game instead of watching streams of it FailFish
Oh hey power and mega rush
we know how much you love this place Kappa
and you're all outta jammin' jellies
yeah but you can't go back to that during 4 mole fight
I take it this seed has jokes
I'm sure you're sick of me by now, but shouldn't Mamar have Tutankoopa cause it was vanilla?
I'm GUESSING you like fire types
Fire's maybe my second favorite behind Dark
I see the espe and umbre
These guys SUCK at aiming their cannons
Oh the bosses are randomized too?
i got the a whole room full.
yo Phantom, how goes the rando today?
For 15 bucks phanto274Ban iceblueBan can be yours my friend
You could add the peach / kammy koopa fight back in to pad for time
you went live at the perfect time KEKW
Gg on hotfix. That was a really fun run
i seen a lot of it but missed the ending got to watch the vod when it on yt
i'm in pengel mode right now
someone stole the SRC page out from under me
so i have to do it now
i know right, how dare they not realize i was routing it secretly and just do a run themselves
the clip of the run i had found is on there as WR though lmao so they used a portion of a run to get the SRC page
and also are running into the same troubles i was with finding any other footage
but i think my route is faster than what this person is doing
right now i need to just focus on getting fights in as few tries as possible
but they buy a couple unnecessary things in their route
It's so short even having a surgery is faster
I mean you're an hour in
bro had a lot on his mind
Where do you lost time? And don't you fucking dare say all throughout the run
So glitchless debatable and glitchless sucks dungeons
quick with tp? never herd such a thing so long
phanto274Wave gl hf! Good thing this is a short and quick speedrun
I had that thought in my head xD
I'm thinking like... it can't be only that
I mean you got hyrule castle
He was gonna to head there
how did your gdq thing go?
Dude would've found someone if this never happened
anything else planned for this year?
Every time I hop in, I see an even better split 1 phanto274Gold
I wish we could skip the monster arriving cutscene
I got a hi from Mirby... I'm happy now
i did something i never thought i'd do before lol
i spent $260 on two games lol
highest tier version of Civ 7 for myself and maddy
civ's always a good time, this will likely be worth it
its a pretty big series of games
All I can think is civilization army and idk why
first video game series to win a grammy even
since civ 4's theme baba yetu won
that was big for VGM in general, mainstream acceptance and all
and now we're in a world where meta knight's theme has ALSO won a grammy with the 8-bit big band cover
civ7 comes out on the 11th
there's a forgotten land mod that replaces meta knight's sword with a grammy because of that lmfao
Did I miss you jumping into the mist?
Then yeah I missed it lolz
Does the route you're doing differ very much from the WR route?
I had a dream I owed Scott the Woz $500
that right there's a sound i'm gonna get used to quickly
I remember letting out a very loud "oh, HELL NAW" then I woke up shortly afterwards
since i'm doing ape escape for ice's next async lmao
link is on strike for being made to go too fast
Idk how you missed that...looked like a good distance
do u like the doggo sections or no cause ik some dont
even doggo on strike by bonkin?
telling   link is  on strike todat
all the way back to where u came from
ads ended as u got here
Had to go for a long while
I always have just a jingle in head when I see you going against the river flow
You have a resting bitch face too? Huh..
I honestly don't know why they call it that
Oh yeah awsm ur movings and apparently im grooving just got 3 rando digimon packs outta nowhere and got a secret rare TigerVespamon.
Because of your size? I thought you were like... 5'7 or so
There's no way you're shorter lolz
i know how tall they are
Omg there's only one person as tall as you
i just started wii u version yesterday its my first playthrough
i can already tell you're farther than me
what do you mean this bridge has rails
Rain has a rbf too and is like...6'
Tall men just look angry... idk why
im at death mountain and i already have max rupees and im like noooo
knocked him off the bridge pog
She's hot and her music is soothing
my favorite character so far is the old goron that has smoke coming out his body
i kind of wonder what this game would have been like if link stayed a wolf the whole time but i know people would have rioted
Well you wouldn't be able to get most of the stuff done if he was
iron boots -> ball and chain
he could throw a boomerang with his mouth
i guess it would be legend of midna at that point
@TomaThePolliwog That game would just be Okami lol.
midna would do a lot of heavy lifting
Caught some of the gdq run good job
oh true. i forgot about okami
i have an okami pin of amaterasu
im thinking about getting a midna plushie but im not sure theres many options
I'd definitely like a wild link plushie... have our dog wonder what's going on
cmon pokemon company. you made a life size lucario
im surprised at how good the gamecube version looks for being the gamecube version
im surprised this area makes you look up. its so hard to look up normally
I'm being totally normal about a ship from the Sonic movies
Sonic is greatness that Shadow performance and narrative use is timeless
My baby like cat has climbed onto me
Indeed hehe, and i'm doing good
Not awwe lolz it use to be awww
mister yuji naka is uh. well. rip mr yuji naka
ty it really means a lot
i gotta write that down to say during my stream
it was an analog glitch youll get it next time no problems
I only got that right once...
Oh thank God I can breathe properly
He was laying on my chest up to my face
Oh no I don't lolz it was just that
I was gonna say you have allergies yet you have a cat as fluffy as chucky lolz
I didn't think people could adjust to pet allergies...I figured they would try and stay away from the one they are
Should have a timer just for the climb for shits and giggles
how long left of run me need sleepys
fine ill stay up to 4am then  hmph just to watch u
3-4 depending on bonks and "link >:("
or untill i pass out like i usualy do i ususaly have u on till me paass out
there was once where i passed out and idk if u raided or twitch bugged    i  got woke up by someone i dont know getting over excited
time for worst dungeon in my opinion   if u ignore irno boot parts in eldin
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
@darkapplequeen I feel somewhat the same because of how tedious it is
Can't pet the doggo though... link had the eyes of a fierce beast
Also he's not potty trained xD
Punch the rat... punch punch the rat.  Kick the rat... kick kick the rat. Now kill the rat... kill kill the rat xD
Sorry I have an overly active brain atm
it was nice  (heh) while it lasted
Yeah isn't there a bomb chest in the stalfos room?
i was able to get my sound from ps5 and pc to play in the same headset its so nice
no more ear buds for twitch FeelsOkayMan
i think the stalfos bombs are faster for any% when you do reverse spinner room
@blacktiger51 you get to rub the ears
it took me a bit to remember what you meant at first because i forgot that going through the spinner room backwards isnt intended lmao
what categories are you planning on learning next?
Baby boy stuck his face towards the window when we smoked... now I have a clingy cat who's high
That happens when I try to do the poe skip. I'm literally doing it... but can't get him to climb into the pole
But isn't that the faster way?
done in time to see my fave weaponry
well my first two people i asked didn't give an answer
phantom, how do i get laid, im looking for a refresher
is the answer just use eeveelutions
...this question is like 5 layers deep and i think you're only privvy to like 2
ACTION waddles into a lot of ice
Is your Twilight Princess or Princess Twilight?
I did not deserve it. Supernova abused their powers. And me. More importantly me.
This is exactly the concern about shared bans when it comes out LUL
yo phantom glhf twilight princess swifWave
is there a slash commend to remove the Suspicious User thing for if i need to do it again at some point
ahh i had to go into mod dashboard and wait for them to type again
Can never have too many arrows
finished my first banjo seed today
first seed took 12 hours split betweeen 3 days but I really enjoyed it
I know ive mentioned to you that eggs can be progressive. Well theres actually like 7 different progressive chains for upgrades. Im a big fan of that
that does not seem OSHA approved
Yo Phantom, how goes the TP?
Well at least it helps you get less rusty between now and next week lol
Nice to still be aheadge at least, shows there's lots of room for improvement with some consistency
@lordofduh btw I made a thread in PMR for uploading Yamls
True, merhigh is one of my favourite
Y'know that was supposed to be a resub alert
I forgot those things are in this game
No I just forgot no disrespect to the manchicken fandom
Amishman19 just sent an AI TTS message to the stream!
I should have just chatted but I had to try it that way
Twilight princess... but instead of it saying "the sequel" it says "the manchickening"
have fun with that half of a penny
Was really hoping I could find a helmasaur emote but no dice Sadge Just helmaroc
So can I hate manchickens now?
It's in case you mess up by some chance?
This room looks ass everytime I see you and Monado do it
wait it got moved to average?
maaaan I can't get my furry action Sadge
Alright Pichu, what are you anteing up today for a PB
i think some question are better left unanswered YEP
Listen, I know not to ask a question if a don't want to know the answer KEKW
wow 😮 what a close twilight
we had to count every thing we have in the store and scan it all
Pog just pulled a crown rare mewtwo
Which one sorry? couldn't quite hear and I can check
10 is a little high no?
That just means more free PB's EZ
chat's not on display, is that intended
we'll see what April's like. I'm gonna have someone file for me, and ideally, she can get that money I allegedly owe to something more reasonable
was playing fire emblem fates while waiting
i'd watch you play some old school pokemon TCG that was on the GB thats on the switch
i enjoy watching how fast they destroy that game with the blastoise rain dance
doesn't hurt to try to submit it
then i say we all go there and take a dump right in the walkway
do you know why they always deny you?
start speedrunning those NSFW games lmao
NSFGDQ, coming soon to a porn site near you.
well what about the randomizer races they have, do you think you could get on one of those
I wish I was good at randomizers or races cause I'd do them more lol.
ahh didn't know that.. well damn, can't win
have there been APs done at GDQ?
sadness ads i wont get my answer
i thought they all had man in name  so out of all who fav
I could never speedrun a game this rng heavy lmao
my favorite Man is Flame Hyenard but he isn't in this game and also isn't a Man.
my friend was playing this game for the first time this week
and bro *would not* believe me that he couldn't S buster lvl a single random enemy
i told him to skip to 3, or at least 2
but he wanted to do it in order
Oh okay I just thought of a terrible pun and I feel bad
he does not like the number of random battles
If you go watch a Broadway show, does that make you the ... Phantom of the Opera?
@Zeliversal no, because broadway doesn't have operas
any game pre-2006ish has way too much random encounters tbh.
the joke doesnt even make sense
Phantom of the Opera is a musical.
I'm aware, but he can't be the phantom of the opera if he isn't at an opera and is instead at a musical
ah okay lol just makin sure.
I've actually seen phantom of the opera on broadway lol
but i get why people don't
@AudioBlood bn in general, or BN1, specifically ?
I always find randos to be more interesting than speedrunning tbh, but I think this is one of the more interesting speedruns to watch personally.
@buff00n bn in general, this is definitely not a strong point in the series
but then theres me    who waited  a hour and half for u   even tho no idea what playing
some reason i was watching u 4 times
was funny when hearing u say cool 4 times in row
@AudioBlood Was trying to tell someone to start with BN3 instead of BN1, but they refused to listen to me
@buff00n why wont they listen to us
yeah I mean it was like a decade between actual mainline MM games right? Just a billion spinoffs.
Yes made it for the start. How is everyone doing?
@AudioBlood 3 = 6 > 5 > 2 > 4 > 1
3 has the better story, but 6 gameplay is phenomenal
I think I just got tired of 6 eventually, it lasted a bit too long
only BN game I've played is One Step From Eden, I enjoyed it a lot, maybe I should try BN.
to me its 2/3 1st place tie. i love 4 and 5 story line. as for starforce the gemini twin constellations in teh anime and game were bada$$ kinda like starscream in transformers or dinobot
how do u know the numbers  is there any way to know or just guess
so far cause not reallt watched this before number man section isnt nice
I love SF's stories but I am NOT a fan of the Card system and your area being 3x1
Even though Bass broke bank in my heart, shademan and the dark chips with duo made things so much more interesting I dark beated both red and blue and
hiya glhf with whatever this is swifLurk
yea those cycles don't seem convenient
take care hopefully future runs won't be as brutal
get the ass RNG out your system, that's the strat
damn I just finished eating lunch lol
made a breakfast sammich, bowl of oats and a cup of yogurt
heading to work, gl on the runs
good luck with the runs today
Peaches said she won the Switch 2 viewing raffle
I’m gonna need a nap before work today.
hey just wanted to say your pm rando vods have been keeping me busy at work nice to be able to catch you live keep up the awesome content
No like where gift/bit lb is
Go to my chat and look
back room is cleaned for the new washer and dryer tomorrow. now I’ll nap
Me I have the flu type A so rest is in my near future
Only good thing is I caught it early
that is caught the signs early
the game over jingle is choice
If I ever wind up streaming speedruns I wanna use the Total Distortion game over for mine :D
If you pb I will stuff a duck live on stream
Really? Says the one not claiming to be a degenerate
i know the other swift is here too
Swift is more wholesome, I'm just a dick
LUL too bad I can't post videos in here cause I'd post a very appropriate response to that from an old TV show called Red Dwarf.
You know I get why I'm timed out constantly now
Motherfucker you did it frame 1 you got the sword
I'm sorry. Do what to the stove?
I mean the stove is hot so it makes sense???
Cmon give me your A game
I always go to bed IN SHAMBLES.
the game is clearly telling you to escape the fight LUL
im not familiar with mmbn tbh
good luck with ur run !
woah twilight princess is so cool
why is fireman so big omg
i always imagined him as a tiny guy
its ok no more random encounters rest of the game 1 in a million odds trust
when do you get the run chip
yeah, and regardless of getting a pb the practice is nice for an event
ive never ran at an event before- it sounds exciting
i like ur lines on the overworld
But what if I wanna do it do it
makes sense, i noticed a couple times you walked towards a diagonal instead of walking up right then right
sometimes i pause on an autoscroller because losing time on an aurtoscroller is funny
its crazy how hard you can get trolled in this game
im curious though, do you have to use sword for him?
i assume that you have to or its so fast u basically have to
i have to go i wish you luck!
Nothing will ever beat the triple quake 3 you had in that marathon
Yeah they're heading to the water works facility
Ah ok cuz it says last day of attempts something
U going back to paper mario
You gotta join the next multi. We need more yamls
I would love to see Phantom do a multi
But didn't join this one haha
There are some games that are just really rough for multiworlds
I really like PMR in multi though
Chip trader bouta give you 5
Phantom I need a favor that will be both little work on your end but significant for me
I need you to be a witness when I sue Mondo for skipping the 297
You just have to say *He said he would do at a 297" and point at him innocently
So in good news and bad news. I got a lot of work done on my project today
It was just more... Sideways than forward
I'm working on a bot for a site's API
Dex has no clue how to use guts
strimmer don't you think it is silly that you have to play this game in another language? Kappa
if only the mods would make it english only
like repel in pokemon of sorts
do u get to go shopping still tho
is that what the kids are callin it these days
Jack in to power up and Execute
Got to get to an event its been fun.
this was probably the least fun fight casually for me by a big margin tbh
tho it's been awhile so idk if there's been worse that i played lol
Ever thing you will get Tera Man?
And each is like 1000 Mega Mans
But you let me stay anyway :)
If you want I can double up and sue Monado for killing your runs
Pog You will be entitled to financial compensation
FUCK YEAH LETSGO SAD TIME I FUCKING LOVE SAD TIME
i wish someone would jack into my oven
everyone's got their own shit going on tbh
just an oven looking for a squirter
thankys for stream again phantom i gonna try sleep i gonna leave u on in baackgorund
hey if it's not too much to ask could you check the poptracker discord when you get a chance after stream ends?
That's a thing in this game????
Glad to see Lan finally backing up his net navi
i knew you could do it chip tarder
Oh Phan...they got me the boot and after a month I should be fine
Which means finally my first stream will happen in March and I'm so happy!
How have your battle network runs been going?
Hope you get to play if they do
Rolling into that just broke one I saw that xD
After that I'd wanna redo too. It's always the ones by the shed itself
Hey at least you can do goats again
its faster to turnaround, then quickly roll while turning around again at the beginning there btw
gl i now have windows 11 out of basically force so i'm annoyed
it was inevitable i just chose to embrace it now not later
yep so i'm looking into addons to fix shit like windows explorer
yeah my immediate gripes are the explorer, why tf is everything rounded windows, and why is the taskbar so tall
oh and the whole centering my applications thing, i like left justified
Like I tell everyone... well as I can be lolz
ya i heard of the setting so im digging
mid when are you locking in
Later when I’m not crashing to ook lol
i hate the sound settings change
twitter but not run by a dipshit
without as many haters but you can also nuke them into oblivion wiht the block button
mai can't believe you just herded 20 goats apparently
idk windows doesn't let me click on the clock and see the fucking calendar anymore apparently
why is that an extra button press
i don't have a need for a virtual desktop in my current situation
instead i just have my main pc and my work laptop is on ubuntu
like i don't do any work shit on my main pc so i keep all those apps on my work laptop
i'd considered doing that to like, restore a work session with slack/work email/github but if it sucks on w11 i'll just not
because i do *some* work from my main pc but only ever like, slack or a quick logistical thing
flying enemies in a video game fucking you over? that never happens.
oh my fucking windows isn't activated because it was a shared product key with my family years ago
and now it's associated with the account not the device. fuckers.
okay now i have an activated fucking copy of windows
so i can actually change advanced audio properties on my fucking devices
@TheGlubbers for some reason i imagined your funny phantom zant clip except you fighting windows and just talking to it
i think my favorite part of that statement, doopsie, is that i have to ask "which funny phantom zant clip" because the exact same thing has happened twice
the go to the middle ill suck your dick clip
bizhawk is fuzzy and make me drop frames like done other and I just started streaming lol
the main difference is the clip ending with "nice" in the first one and "i can't believe that worked twice" in the second one
you should have enter forest temple not ending blow lmfao
this is like when i watch oot hundo and the split is "forest temple" and they're in fucking water temple
theres a segment that gets some gold skulltulas and stuff in water but ends by fwobing to forest and killing phantom ganon then doing a wrong warp again
but it confuses the shit out of me because it's the forest temple split and they're not in forest temple KEKW
i have possibly also called it cursed to him then
two hacks i was waiting on retroachievements for both got theirs finished today so that's nice lol. that solves the "don't know what to play" issue i've been having
the fuckin volume mixer isn't its own window anymore it's a god damn widget
Yeah I seen that it’s annoying asf
i use the volume mixer to mute my cap card's audio since it plays directly to desktop
Free ride into the pond NODDERS
you pay that tileworm with either cash, grass, or ass
Nah ook would be out for blood if it happens again
i've run this game for half a decade nearly
and i've crashed on ook exactly one time
did you try looking at his hands
karg crashing is way easier i've definitely done that at least 5 times
imagine if that was the bit frame
can't wait for you to choke PB by one second
im concerned that i'd just win
i don't think clearing a 6h time is gonna be hard for me even if i'm reading a route KEKW
oh can you juggle it to the other rock
"this is probably my worst forest temple ever" game: aight bet
phantom come on. this is twilight princess. you can only lose time to goht in majora's mask :P
you lost more than that laughing about the stupid void after rang
oh right the glitchless route has this hype part
And talk to the postman KEKW
this is why AD is better mid
there's only one postman skip and it's at the end
Olaf spent this entire morning parked on top of my chest, demanding affection
i love that you can put the postman outfit on link in hyrule warriors
he's currently on my lap, still demanding attention
hyrule warriors 100% speedrun sub goal pauseBedge
it was on the twilight princess adventure map
I feel like I’ve heard of Hyrule warriors but never watched gameplay
you singlehandedly take out hundreds of foes
should i put the money for sgdq away now
bad sides: agdq was this month
yeah i do technically just have it, just makes me feel bad to put that much aside after spending that much
"technically" meaning "i have it and am putting an arbitrary conditional on something that's just there"
eh i'll do it next month
you ever consider how much stuff you mess up trying to get these bugs in kakariko
people returning to their homes to see furniture knocked over and stuff
i forgot you blew that house up
really good sure, but you need 17 more for it to really be nice
17 more for it to be 1nice
ew RA Roulette started this week and one of the achievements is have goombario join the party
thought i'd look and that achievement for paper mario itself has an 84% unlock rate. that means 16% of people remembered goombario was in the game and stopped playing :P
well that's a new one to me
i've seen clips there but not a sidehop
this really is a run of all time
usually its people getting hit by a goron and clipping
why am i seeing so many people posting "paid rent" and being upset
do people really pay rent on the due date
i can understand waiting for paychecks
I have mine set on a schedule 2 days in advance cuz I get so anxious about missing it lol
my rent's due on the first, i pay on the 20th
credit cards i play the balancing game to maximize credit score more
Some people actually request to set it around the time of when they're paid
yeah that's why i pay on the 20th anni
that's when i used to get paid
current job i get paid on the 15th but still
yeah 15th and last day is current job
other jobs i've had have been the 5th and the 20th
5th and 20th is just consistent dates but functionally identical to 15th and last day
It's a lot better separating bills and necessities rather than paying all at once
i can see it for ease of bookkeeping
my student loan and rent are the 19th and 20th respectively
everything else is between the 1st and the 5th
I have not yet paid off my student loans
oh yeah twitch is like the 12th
it goes in a fund i don't look at often. that's why my sgdq is already able to be paid for
The college fees in the US are stupid expensive NOPERS
and i'm still riding the cushion i got from... not streaming for 3 years but people staying subbed
@midnaliin yeah I wouldn't really have that large of amount in student loans if my household was doing a bit better
But I cared for my family so
Yeah for sure. I just find it a bit unfair the US charges so much for college. it’s not as bad in Canada (yet)
i'd like mine to be paid off
That slug is the worst KEKW
I uh had like adoption certificate which the government paid for college
I just realized that’s the actual entrance for Lanayru twilight lol
Lake Hylia?! that’s so far KEKW
Wait for the karg to be closer to the ground before you do the first one. it makes the regrab free
All I heard was “I’m surprised you know how to do it” so I’m watching Adge offended KEKW
Okay what’s this about you’re surprised I know stuff lol
I do because I don’t do karg drowning
True I need to do all the crashes now
Is that where you clawshot argorok weird?
I’ve seen it but haven’t done it lol
it's so dead at work right now i'm literally just relaxing watching the stream with my feet on my desk lol
it's like how matt murdock is a really good lawyer. it doesn't answer the question of how he does what he does but it's true :P
That's why horses get scared when you yell
man catches a brick thrown from behind him while blind with his bare hand and his only explanation on how is "i'm a really good lawyer"
one of my favorite jokes from no way home
I say throw a bomb arrow at him instead xD
Yeah escort is by far the worst part of TP
@buff00n sorry I wasn’t fully paying attention wdym?
it was just doing some test asyncs Rigby made.
Ohh I see. yeah they are all horrible KEKW
I don’t know I’m not super fast but mazarus said to give them a try and see what I think
they want feedback also for season 4. the fastest one for me so far is with the 40 power stars and 4 chapters. 😂
I play for fun really. I don’t have a set time I stream some days because of work.
woo 60k more points til VIP lets go
i do try to catch everytime your on and lurk or have it as background noise when taking care of the spawns
I'll be unemployed I'm guesstimating for a few months
Probably start a job after SGDQ
What do you do Phantom? if you don’t mind me asking
me every time in lost woods
i agree with phantom, it was pretty rough
it's a good thing it's all a numbers game WICKED
Late response but I think AMS skips MDH right?
can't wait to be on my TP arc this year fr
stupid dog you made me look bad
Eyo, gl on the run phanto274Wave
Yea I saw that. Had my mind all over plando though
I can prolly play around with your code a bit tomorrow. Think I'm basically done with plando
The second one is much not exciting
More omg the autocorrect fucked me
wow, you use ladders. i only escalate with pure rope
I never organized an AGDQ 2024 photo album 😔
I’m like “going to the buffet” and it was a roasting pig
what do you mean you cain't skip What
can't skip sure but can i hop
" it'll hopefully sort itself out "
Yeah investigating that is just putting yourself at risk tbf
Omg the Pac-Man ghost is hype PauseChamp
i've been subbed to someone for almost 100 months but she never added badges past 2 years so i get it lol
You need to make the 5 year badge for the OG people NODDERS
U should def do DSS no matter how much i love the death animation
gonna have u in background like usual ye
<3  helps me too with deppresion from hospitl
Hope you feel better @darkapplequeen midnal1Fluffycatlove
just the 1 run today ye  ?
thats only proby with tp    cause so long u can only do 1 a stream
Yeah this category is literally an all day event KEKW
why did the word doggo get  not sent
did it say "this message could not be sent"
cause if so that isn't a block that's just twitch being dumb
I took a nap earlier so I wouldn't be too tired to drink tonight but I'm too tired to drink tonight Sadge
gimme soup gimme cheese gimme all I desire
that's how the song goes right
If you pb I will eat kooper's shell with my very own 2 cheeks
Gimme fuel gimme fire gimme that which I desire
Enter Sandman, bring me a dream, may he be the cutest that I've ever seenn
Motherfucker doesn't even say fire clearly
Gimme fue gimme fi gimme that which I desi is what I hear KEKW
Guess the chilfos said go fuck yourself for me
and u keep going to same rooms again and again
should have said hi as wolfy
I got a golden one you can grab
for me it was frame 3 going into frame 4
just curious can u bonk link with statue  ?
now for link to become birb ans go to sky?
@theglubbers go fuck yourself you Pringle ass bitch
You're ahead so obviously it doesn't suck Kappa
ur very mean to dogs today first the ice dogos now that dog
You should figure out where to stand after you kill the dogs, if you stand where the statue spawns link just grabs it immediately and that animation never plays
Its one of the really dark spots on the ground
Hi, I'm looking at my clock but don't see get good o'clock
How can I tell where in the thumbnail to look?
Saw ya in the live feed Uncle Phantom from Nintendo.
Ordon Shield detected, be good to my son burtooReallyBro
Burn it, and I'll burn you...in Minecraft venomi44Clueless
Every time I say Penny, I have to fight with auto correct because my last name is "Penney" burtooReallyBro
And now, I go take a Canadian shower, with Canadian water, in canadia land. captai2848GREGdance
It means I must disappear like my father, have a good stream venomi44Stonege
How much for you to stick an arrow up your ass
Bomb arrow so you can go out with a big bang
To be fair, could've been worse
Could've been an even slower 7
will be a few minutes, still need to refill everything
You can't get rid of me that easily
I forget, are there any cutscenes long enough that you can escape to the bathroom for? Or do they all require mashing?
Yeah lol. Entering Hyrule Castle is just about at the end of the run anyways though. Not really worth the rushing to and from the throne
Your little ghost dude/dudette(not sure if they're also gender neutral) flopping the Wolf Ears?
also today ur not allowed to be mean to the dogs again
doing a multi, all i have left is artisan cave at battle froniter and BK. While there i found a varia suit LUL
Those children look like the spawn of chucky.
Good luck on the run. SeemsGood
I can finally set my clock
Wait this is a one beast warp?
I always thought this was the first one somehow
But you know what I love more?
No way they dig?? Guess that means you've gotta quit...
why is this game unstable there
cus it needs the object for the cutscene loose and on the floor?
meanwhile the boomerang: "OH LOOK A SPECK OF DUST BEHIND YOU, LOOK OUT!"
can’t say I do or don’t because I’ve never played this
like - they did well in making it big
the postman has his own rules, no? 🙃
pretty sure if he's related to the running man, then something cant be right w him
basically: the running man has the race thing from gerudo valley to kokiri forest bridge
and you just can not beat him
even if you were to teleport there on not started timer, he'd still win
Ok Phantom, just an FYI, I entered you into a race. My code has been running for 5 and a half hours and is got to 50% a few minutes ago. I think you finish the run before it finishes
hey! got your PRs merged, and plando and everything else wrangled onto dev as well. I'm tired now, so ill bounce right away, gl hf
Just play on pace and you probably win
Because you were too busy thinking about Midna and Zelda and the fate of the world and that jerk named Zant
Its okay we've all got Midna on the brain
My chat is not even the worst
I am a civil adult who can have a PG13 conversation
I am absolutely not Glubber's chat LUL
There's a reason I spend no more than 90 seconds as a time in there
Just order a masher on Amazon
I saw one at the store the other day
(vaguely gestures at Zelda Speedrunning community always being mature rated)
Holy balls it’s -23 outside my car barely started and I had it plugged into the block heater all day KEKW
I’m lucky it started cuz I have to go offsite for laundry
Well -23 C is -10 F. So still pretty cold
They have laundry but we had a fire last month and they still haven’t opened it back up
Cuz I think the fire was caused from the dryer lmao
... ok did you want the warm or the cold?
I want warm but not from fire please KEKW
Okay this is true. Open fire in the building was not optimal warmth though
Or even better. Put the fire in a box. Put the box next to tubes of air. Blow the air towards the people.
All heat is created equal but some heat is created more equal than others
Is this dude more or less annoying than Bo KEKW
Oh okay so less RNG involved that’s nice
Just step to the side and he'll almost always go for a grab
Walking upside down is a glitch NOPERS
But it's okay. He only promised to do LESS glitches. Not NO glitches
Anything 87-93 is allowed. Everything else is banned
Hey that bonk saved you from catching fire
This is the first ever run
Very excited to watch the first ever TP run
So what do you think you will call his fast timed gameplay run?
I didn't mean first ever xD
How many parts do you think you’ll break it up into?
Maybe instead of a Let's Play it's an "I Play, Skillfully"
With 20 minute ad breaks and a bonus feature episode
let's play twilight princess part 50: faron twilight!
And don't forget the sponsor segment spots m
where would the raid shadow legends ad go
Should be an emote that’s how I feel
How would that be an emote xD
god i hate seeing those commercials for raid
We would never advertise bug killer here
But you know who we will advertise?
NINTENDO SWITCH 2. (In partnership with nobody)
Do they give you 75 meals as the deal?
@orangeisborange is your name saying orange is boring?
Yeah that's why I was like... How many weeks
Like I'd probably order 1-2 but not like 4
and then the next best part: running to castle town
Is it faster to jump from south castle town?
the spirits block off south castle town
it's not possible to get there in twilight without cheats
interestingly the poe actually exists there right now
er not south castle town itself, the field but yeah
the poe in south castle town field
I use it everywhere it's so funny to see
You bonk on everything. There's an animation
Rain sent me the funniest shit
You guys know the thong song?
"Your aunt mows your tuna" in French sounds like it
okay I gotta clip that KEKW
God the new mobile clip editing sucks so bad
It’s just very hard to change the bounds on either end
It kept selecting the playback time instead of the edge so yeah
Yeah that is a nice touch
I didn’t know you were Kesha Zeli
well you can be singing like Kesha then
I’m telling Derrick you said that about him Madge
You can do it this time
I wonder if you ride fast enough around gorge to just open the gates and go in and it'll happen
That lady is the one who came up with this idea sir
I think I'm losing it, I read the category as "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Bitchless (Any% NTS-U)
Wait orange I never got an answer lolz
Is it the orange is the new black but shortened by any chance?
Damn... thought that was a good guess
Nah he rolled into the goron... they're like rocks
it's ok, X is now reserved for claw
Mr Phantom, water you doing to that temple?
can I send you a video on a foolproof bomb arrow strat
I guess there's no reason to not do that strat
doesn't it make more sense to do it after starting the flow since you want to be moving towards where that clawshot target is anyway?
does it actually shorten the cs? I'm not sure
Give me a month or so and I'll time it for ya
I was doing a speedrun of an early access game that I am the only one running lmao
it's fun though. got a new PB
That was funnier in my head I'm gonna say
Yeah but he only has one
I've been telling him to have multiple like me and he just won't
Something something having a life smh
People just don't wanna work these days. Pssh only one job
i hate to say it but this temple was the worst in terms of understanding what i was doing
i was like what do you mean the stiars are a slip n slide
blew my mind i was like NOW what do i do
@tomathepolliwog did you try going up the slip and slide stairs the first time?
stop calling me out like that
I hate practicing palace but I must do it
Eel can't see... you finished him in the eye
of course i went up with the iron boots how else was i going to get my miiverse stamp
Oh I forgot it was on the actual wii too omg
it was on gc wii and wii u
wii u replaces a lot of the rupees with miiverse stamps
No wonder they won't put it on the switch
wooo DMCA strikes here we go!!!
lol its just like the lost woods
Just get a strike according to the D-M-C-A
pretty much copyright strike of this music
phantom is "unauthorized" to use it unless he pays a licensing fee basically
DMCA is an act that defines the copyright of digital works. It's what essentially makes digital piracy illegal. It also makes tampering with digital protections illegal.
3 frames of input delay on rolls YES
is the HD version mirrored or nah?
you should play the wii version, that'd really fuck with you lmao
How did they not hear you bark
idk if its on every TP but i noticed on tphd sometimes out of certain actions links direction isn't accurate
I just tried to time mirror with an h
like if you finish climbing a ladder sometimes it takes link a minute to snap to the correct direction its a good couple seconds
Rain: hey baby...why do seagulls fly over the sea?
Because if they flew over the bay they'd be baygulls
Wait if I made that joke I'd be banned?? XD
I’m playing yugioh and people are actually insane how long they take to play KEKW
its because in yugioh not reading a card can cost you the game
Do you play the blue eyes deck df lol
Does that also apply to magic the gathering players?
That’s what I’m playing rn I have the runick deck
but I do have a blue eyes from starter deck kaiba
wow that was a fast turnaround on midna
It's not a game. It's a conflict resolution method
all it took was a quick glance at zelda and she was like aw yeah i feel better
I played it when I was a kid, I grew up watching the first anime and gx
Literally all conflicts can be solved via a duel
actually dpad is really hard to hit accurately on GC
are they gonna dub season 4
it loves to bias left or right
I had to watch it in japanese
the dubs are corny in a funny way
the first anime is especially funny
D: You're not feeling the flow!
that the 1 with xyz monsters right
We should all have an anime night
Ok but that's because 5Ds was hype
i wish the final season of 5ds was dub Sadge
The duels were just... Chef's kiss. Like Vrains was nice for the complex strategies but I hated how characters just got tanked
I really like the final season of GX
pretty sure 4kids lost the right for 5ds
but that is probably because I didn't watch it until I was an adult and it was new
But 5Ds really felt like every character gave their will in every duel
midna taught me something about myself after 9 years of forgetting to finish this game
you should throw in an abridged quote
Is the game developed and published for a game console?
my solution involved one belly bump
oh sorry. i forgot to explain my other story
i can't believe he solved it without making them belly bump
midna to me is very playful and i think i see that in myself. but to everyone else im legitimately skull kid
I love dancing with ladders NODDERS
You'd think Link would have learned how to climb ladders faster by this point
they should have just given link cucco wings in this game
just look at the detailing on the wood
@AnniLyn2 tipsy with some epic tp gameplay
the z-button on GC controllers is ass
The gc controllers today you mean... original gc controllers had a good z button
The z button gets sticky man...
I guess if you had original for so long it's kinda meh to tell
As you said some of the old ones were good some were bad
Gotta say though... the analog was easy to fuck up xD
Because most of the characters have ranged attacks?
ngl i was a bit scared there
the biggest thing is dashing iirc. Cause in Melee dashing is dependent on frame perfectly going from deadzone to full on the stick which is very controller dependent and super finicky.
Idk we can do dashing pretty fine without modding it
Figured if you practice something enough you'd get use to it
if your sticks are shit, you can practice only "so much"
Oh no it was hard at first...like luigis slide
I mean people used to play unmodded but I think it's been about a decade since UCF became the standard I think
That shit was hard to do for a bit til after a while of practice
coulda put those on ebay for casual gaming, hooly
or were the sticks that thrashed
see I hoard gamecube controllers because I like collecting them
I have like 7 working ones
@darkness3827 ooohh okay now i...forgot about time passing
yeah if you don't do it frame perfect you get 7 frames of turn around animation. Which is absolutely massive in competitive.
not denying that, just thinkin that "oh yea uhh throwin'em away" sounds a wee bit "huh" 😅
yeah in UCF the window is upped to a massive 2 frames iirc so it's actually doable.
inner fixerupper of mine be like "whaaaa"
fixing the stick box in that thing sounds like a nightmare tbh
how would that be the board - stick box, I get w it being potentiometer sticks PrideLaugh
I get like tweaking your controller itself instead
yea so the potentiometers - the exact pieces of shit I have been havin issues with for xbOne controllers for the last like 4 years 🤣
I heard there hasn't been a melee tourney in a while
not since december or so, they just released a new top 100 ranking
so there'll probably be tournaments again soon
you got halleffect which has physical magnets for neutral and axis recognition and ya got potentiometer which is resistor based
@Midnaliin bc in a couple thousand units of a product sold, x2 for the amount of sticks, potentiometer sticks are cheaper to mass produce
@jonxhas there was a tourney in December?? I missed it omg
so everyone (nintendo, xbox, playstation) use them
it just enforces there being more controller sales to some extent
Will you enter in next melee tourney?
whereas you COULD do hall effect sticks higher costs in production but also overall more durable, precise sticks
EXCEPT when those deadzones dont help cus your stick goes down BAD in drift
like - my current one has a 70% tilt on right stick upwards
that just sounds like the deadzone in MM
whats worse is that its only there when I dont press the stick in into held button
but who holds down the stick that harshly for hours on end
so I am assuming my stick doesnt necessarily have drift, but the box of the stick itself broke somewhere or partially got pulled upwards on that axis or something
I might be one of those people
either way nothing I could fix now
as for what my preferred fix would be? getting halleffect sticks to replace'em
cus from gamecube onwards, hall effect stick boxes exist
its just that nintendo, sony, xbox dont care about puttin those in
but I'll let myself be surprised by teardown videos tippiGiggle
i feel like they don't care enough they are sitting on money
cost of prod per howevermany units they consider -> lots of moolah in the thousands or millions of product
I assume thats why they increased the rubber thingy atop the stick as per how their video looked
to prevent a wee bit more dust from getting in
I'm still trying to send my joycons to them but I keep forgetting
fun bit: its a couple cents roughly per stick to do, not literal USD amounts per stick
so it rly is only noticeable once you get into the tens of thousands of sales
but where ya can shave costs as a company'n such
its probably the handling costs that are more expensive and shipping
cmon tp, this isnt OoT logic
guess which console's controllers had hall effect sticks throughout
but still failed cus the stick casing was properly shit
they used such a cheap ass fuckin plastic that over the course of you casually playing a lot of games on it, you'd get those grey ish crumbs fallin out of the case here'n there or see it in the stick
and bc they back then didnt have the stick casing figured out well, they went to what everyone else wa using
Mario party 2 was fun as shit and Dr mario was so competitive with my grandma and me
yeah i don't get it either. happens on wii u also
Idk you hit him twice and paused and did the normal hits you usually do
either way, me rambling over small things 😅
sometimes link decides to normal attack and have insane delay instead of doing the crouch strike
Oh right I missed the rest of yesterday
sandman? okay now I am thinkin of clayface
By the way my code estimate is still 3 hours. So...
"love" my parents btw - since yesterday, the heater in my room's been icecold
room at 19C right near my PC 🙃
2 to 3 colder if ya take a step away
i hope the humidity is low
It ends up hot af in the room with the computer on and door closed
uhhhm... avg humidity for indoors living areas I'd say
Oohh that's how you do that
I've found spinning the stick slower really helps with it
Gotta find that good in between
wait hol on - this just the input display or is your L button gettin pressed while you're spinning by you or nah
Omg I forgot how much I love this games soundtrack
You know I just realized I could have made this run like 16x faster...
8x or 16x. Depending on how I do the math
oh hey, just peeked at weather outside, no shot am I just imagining it being cold - outside its freezing temps SMILERS
every part with midna is a good part
If it's still snowing in Florida then you're not imagining it
just on a whack ass sleep schedule over here KEKW
Not why I said it xD
the entire time ive been in florida its only snowed twice
thats like 25 years for me
No it's fine...I dont even know if it's still snowing there...is it snowing where you are?
you comin towards what time rn?
yeah Germany is like 6 hours ahead of me and I'm EST so yeah 3 AM
Yeah dark that's usually how I do it
east coast +6 is how ya get germany, +5 for british
its definitely not your usual time to wake up at local midnight , that much I can guarantee KEKW
like - my sleep schedule's fucked
I say stay up til night... shower... and then try to go to sleep
oh come to think, phantom I might have a couple questions for dms (not necessary to answer like today but rather a curiosity "soon") if thats okay
Insomnia kicking in early this year
k will send away then PrideFlower
the snowboarding song is so good
oh! can I ask for that to be a weekend thing maybe?
I know its stupid to ask, but would like to be able to watch it, and starting end of this week, I assume to be hyper busy weekday
Hell yeah Morph love that game
would lean big into fridays done, fall into bed, wake up hyper early on weekend to watch
ofc only if it specifically lines up, cus the pallet cleanser thought goes big
I think I want that ice cream now...
wait does she not have painted toes on gamecube
i guess it will be confirmable later
i only remember because i was like oh hatsune miku toes
Trying to hide the foot fetish
@TomaThePolliwog I'd be surprised if there were model graphics differences
feet are often very divisive. not many people are indifferent
You got a fetish...be happy about it
THANKS FOR ASKIN WHT I WAS ABOUT TO TYPE
Its been a thing for a while
But its a really expensive bit emote
Can't let people have that for free
but hear me out, imaaaagine t3 would get it
allofasudden everyone subs in t3 KEKW
What if I ask very nicely Monado, can I get it for free?
i loved how silly he is when he takes items
It's true. I'm a t1 but I act like a t3
Besides. Emotes don't matter ever since he retired
Monado retired? Props to you Mona
this guy was extremely hard for me
I can't even remember the last time he was live
I never understood how to get to his tail
vanilla? there's clawshot targets on the ceiling
except he doesnt like throwing the ball and chain much without you doing a passingby
but it's a very tight hallway
Well yeah I found that out after watching you
Yeah the clawshot targets are supposed to hint you to clawshot the ceiling
yeah i completely missed them the first time
Oh Phantom, question, when your Monado RSU's vest would you want to sell?
Because I did the clawshots before but he'd never throw it
ya need to pass by him rather closely
He said it's a perk but they take 30 years to vest
So I just packed soup and got hit
So we got 29.9 years to go
speaking of fun vanilla, that chest in the main hall with the swinging platforms :D
doing some wind waker all dungeons
@Darkness3827 the chest you either love or hate KEKW
had a good run so not too bad
funnily enough, I do like that chest
nice. gonna lurk and make dinner. GL!
lmfao imagine if you could phantom KEKW
awww it doesnt say load in english
I never paid attention to that
ive never understood what this room is for
in mansion chapels for rich ppl
because theres no projector and no like. theres no room for a chapel guy to talk
its just a bunch of benches
maybe yeto and yeta took the thing you're thinkin somewhere else
but getting damaged is fast strat
Man too bad we can't find out the meaning of love
the second best moment in gaming history
the first best moment is when you catch the heart piece at the fishing hole
No phone that was one too many
so Midna won't let you just let you ignore the containers in vanilla? lame :( I always wondered about it but never bothered to actually try lol.
its like how OoT any Piece of heart in the open, freestanding is applicable to boomerang. therefore in rando, you can do the same there
Well there's your problem. You got it set to M for Mini, when it should be set to R for Rando...  You know... I rando, you rando, he she me... Rando? Rando, randoing, randology the study of rando? It's first grade Phantom!
i fr thought it just walked off the dge
good thing that chicken always comes back to the platform you're on cus generous resets, yea?
tbf Link also warped in there so Skull Kid just usin the same technique.
i hate this game for freezing the camera as he runs off
I rly wish this skull kid were to reveal where that grin came from PrideLaugh
cus... its not like we cant ASSUME which skull kid this is specifically
my guess is this is THE skullkid, having chosen paint to reflect what happened in MM, with the puppets summoned being a set of 4 and bigger then him based on the purpose of "yea I had 4 friends, they're with me in spirit for forever"
Would you like me to file an injunction?
now hear me out: if this type of jump attack was in MonHun and you could cut tails behind you with it, I'd take it KEKW
but capcom got their hitboxes mostly figured out by now in that game. just scaling them by percentages tends to be fucky
you should just start speedrunning the rando but with everything vanilla.
@Nintendo You are hereby ordered by the court of Phantom's chat to stop messing with his run, under penalty of contempt, punishable by a fine of $0 or 0 hours of community service
I wonder how much time that'd actually save in the run.
Link just got fuckin clotheslined there.
@Darkness3827 in MM, OoT? a lot cus of all the cutscne skips. depends on how liberal those things happened in this PrideLaugh
I was talkin bout this game.
tagbarrel anywhere vanillamizer DK64 goes HARD on timesaves, that I know
@Darkness3827 I know, just was thinkin of what could be potential areas where TP vanillamizer could be faster
cus any place you got rando niceties attached throughout -> timesave potential
fast boots would help a lot I'm sure.
faster text options if its faster in rando to vanilla
Just remember. No matter how bad it gets, it's still faster than my computer running millions of calculations
I guess big timesave for this place would be that you could just save reset to the lobby after getting DomRod
cus vanillamizer glitchless could "just do that" as well
i did the poe in one of those first rooms early by perfectly throwing a tiny statue from like 40 feet away
it was my single pro gamer moment in my 40 hours of playing so far
thats a great strat to memo
even if in rando not applicable
sudden heart attack that lizalfos KEKW
I dunno, there is a floor transition on those stairs yea?
maybe the upper room unloaded enough of its collision so that he'd fall through the ground?
Insert it’s so over were so back graph
isnt there an emote about dark and non dark mode which has that text on it
but only one of'em gets seen based on whether dark or light mode is enabled browser side
aonuma got me on this one with the funny music
I renember jcog had one like that on either 7tv or bttv hol on
Killing him with the bow should be counted as a glitch cause clearly it was unintended :P
THIS GAME HAS RETROACH-- oh no.
what do you mean i have to play it twice
@TomaThePolliwog completed the set over here
you CAN do it on one savefile
but you'd HAVE to do a 3heart run first, then a completionist cleanup through all dungeons again
well. i guess i will just have to be happy with my miiverse stamps
so honestly just do a hundo and then do a 3heart 1 bottle run
for minish cap I know the only thing ya didnt do is damageless vati
windwaker is my fault to an extent as I had NPCs mapped wrong in my head
so you didnt do the goat wrestle, ya didnt watch bees attack someone other then link
and then from looks a bunch of "do this miniboss this way"
or "do cave of ordeals twice"
I just did it at the eldin bridge warp grotto
and after 20 minutes of it not working well, I went and said "fuck it" and chose to clean out that pool a bit
thats how i feel with a lot of retroachievements
there's more then that one grotto where you can get stalfish and bombfish, but bombfish hitboxes are stupid
its not even that hard to make "casual" achievements
so just - take rang, take out some stalfish, as the bombfish come back out
but its always "pro speedrun 1000%" achievements with like nearly impossible glitches
its definitely among the more annoying ones
like the super mario sunshine one where you go a hoverless petey pirhana
you have to like angle manip one of those pondskaters and its just
to be fair, mario games leaning into "light" speedrun tricks is fair ish imo
it is not a light trick
cus you dont HAVE to do the pondskater thing necessarily
you can do y turn spinjumps up atop as well
anyway, I don't want my achievements to be miracles
that one definitely is up there on that edge
but given what speedrunners would say is or is not "light" and all, just wanna say that thats not "among the worst offenders" imo
15 power bounces in TTYD sit there being a grindfest though
or, Sunshine still: the pianta village trickjump stuff
to me light = something you could theoretically do on accident just messing around.
like is there an achievement for playing with a dog using a bone
fair darkness. I assume the "light" in retrocheevos respect goes more towards "easy to learn entry tricks in speedrunning" for what I have seen in platformer related things
@Zeliversal dont encourage "do 15 power bounces while having unsimplifier equipped twice" 🤣
You know. It's kind of funny you say that when that's how I explained to Jacq the bug in my code earlier LUL
that would make it be like what, 10 frame perfects?
personally for me, i would like achievements that encourage me to see all of a games dialogue. stuff that i wouldn't normally see
also the "light tricks" bit being a reason why I will NEVER do LTTP cheevos
cus they START with "oh yea who's your uncle"
Basically, like I explained it to him. My code was trying to perform a frame perfect trick. The game was running at 30 fps, but the monitor only ran at 15 fps, but somehow it still PB'ed
and then turn into "do ganons tower swordless"
thanks for the alert on that blue rupee, game.
also doing dungeons in reverse order essentially
like an achievement for wearing the zora mask in OOT and talking to ruto after you rescue her, she has unique dialogue there where shes like "oh, are you ready to marry me now?"
@TomaThePolliwog you'd like MM's cheevos then
Do maybe if you're lucky you'll PB too Yep
I think the worst offender you got in there is getting the hug and doing the delivery for the mask in one session
but it also got those "oh look at this dialog" bits here'n there cus like - you only have 4 dungeons to 3hearts through
yeah we need a retro-speedrunner-cheevos :D make it all be some ultra garbage shit that's requires like weeks of practice shit.
"do a 120 star run within 2hours
stage ILs I can see ppl grind out
SM64 beat the game with 1 A press :P
like - that shit I can easily see grinded out compared to that
and nobody with these times is going to use an emulator to do it, they probably play on real hardware
so like who is that for
even if its still HARSH time wise
@TomaThePolliwog for those who want to brag
if only it was trackable beat the game blindfolded would be funny af.
beat the game blindfolded is just a forced AR code away tbh
like... there have been a total of 4 hardcore unlocks on that sub2h 120star run
6 total if including softcore which allows for savestate loads
out of over nearly 35k players
its got some INSANE point values
is it not just easier to take off bomb arrows rather than leave it on and disable it every time?
but yea like - the specific stage ILS I could see being grinded out more easily then full single segment runs
one I HATED - forgetting if it was Master Quest MM or Masked Quest
but one of them needed you to do ranch defense (so aliens and milk cart) for all 3 things in a single session
now shadow, recite the bible in japanese or you're the faker
so you had to song of time cycle each time, buy a new keg each time
I don't need to know if your rod is glowinf
I think in the end I had spent like 3 hours just for a single hug after tons of gold rupees
whats worse imo? sometimes single session does mean you are allowed to reset
though doable if you were to nerf marios damage into tankio and went to rawk
i didn't know you were supposed to step on those the first time and i like went to three of them without doing anything
for me it was "yea just do it alongside going through like ch5 and 6
as both overall were at the point where you have access to all stylish commands
hey - better then being stuck in power bounce hell
for those I sat in the sewers on the spike goombas
with D up P down all the way to doing no damage
literally just farming my audience in the game to nothing
i had a camera when poe hunting where an enemy was in front and it was just showing like a skeletons ass
CantSkip City in the Sky true
wasnt that an animated emote before?
btw phantom: kudos on being on 40 series nvidia now
50 series by looks is SOOO fuckin overpriced
the music in this area really annoys me
also the horsepower it got via RAM on it even if that by all means is not near the top
like - you're not doing 4k video editing
i understood this whole area except for where you have to descend from the giant fan, i spent like an hour trying to figure it out before i googled
cus last I know, DLSS type shit doesnt help raw compute power for rendering outside of gaming
either way - at this point, I rly would not be surprised if nvidia might have to re-evaluate if they wanna go pure datacenter or not
cus sure, for LLM stuff it seems like their GPUS are somewhat worth, and so far that train of thought hasnt stopped
even with recent events which were honestly hilarious
didnt know that was an interaction
You don't need to practice it
I think someone stole your talent
Can you think of anyone who would want to slow you down?
Ok. Next chat message is from the person who stole it and will be treated as a confession:
The previous chat message is from the person who stole it and will be treated as a confession:
Cheer100 Shadow: I stole your talent so I could find out where are those damn chaos emeralds
too prideful to even change his name
I recommend it in 90% of cases where practicing helps
That plant wall was so slow it could have been a ladder
I'm shook how slow Link moves on that
No wonder you want to get as high up on that as possible
i love this game for the theming but i think oot/mm is more polished in terms of core gameplay freedom
like you can't even hookshot to chests in this game
whats the zora armor for then?
Damn you can get a huge gold here
if when ya get hit by argorok, ya got trolled
I mean this run you'll probably get a good sized one
what do you mean this isn't metroid
Damn I hate when my peahats get wet and fly away
Yeah I thubj you just die if you get hit with this many hearts lmao
You’re still going? damn this category is long KEKW
@Monado how I knew that before "mobile moment" was "sausage fingers" in a direct german to english translation KEKW
for "oh yea ya just fat fingered"
just dont get bbqd and glod from what I get
Still a better run than yesterday
midna can you stop sounding so sad PLEASE my heart
WHYYY does this game have the restrctions of frickin SM64 KEKW
"oh you cant exit course, you're not in idle!"
Hmm. I have a dilemma. Do I spend like 4 hours to set up automation for something that I'll do once and take me 30 minutes?
what are you doing zeliversal 🤣
this isnt about pokeclicker or something LIKE that is it KEKW
@jonxhas Setting a server, or templating a server image
if ya set up automation once, even if you might not need to set up this specific instance again
could always be something you can set up again at some other time
I'm setting up a git server
But yeah eventually I'll want a server for the bot
But then I won't finish tonight :(
my productivity in coding has absolutely dropped the past 6 months but ive got zero idea why
but zeli - think of future timesave on helping others
It’s slower but I find it easier KEKW
its like my focus is just gone
Sounds like a skill issue to me
or helping yourself in different projets
I could help Zeli this week by streaming Pikmin
Guess you don't want Pikmin then
Actually Mondo could you do it Tuesday?
@Jonxhas You're damn right I have, already played it FeelsOkayMan
I've actually followed the project for like 4 years lol
@Monado same - fuck my right stick though, controlling pikmin with drift on c stick is SHIT KEKW
I literally warned Monado there would be dire consequences if he didn't stream Pikmin last Wednesday, so I can only assume he retired as a way to repent
I did cheevos for 1, 2 and 251 with that KEKW
ya kinda get accustomed to it, but it rly is a double dance of "when will my pikmin just run off into shit"
But @monado I'm flying tomorrow so I'd be most grateful if you waited until Tuesday. Enough to even forgive you for last week and unretire you monadoSmile
You don't dictate when I'm retired
You aren't the CEO of Twitch or Amazon
No. They just report to me. Even if they don't know it
then again - I think playing the dark souls series with a xb360 controller which had both sticks able to just stick in all 360 degrees cus of how fucked it was worse then the drift on my c / right stick there KEKW
had grbo luck on good controllers so far
We already established Zeli is Kesha
Okay then by that logic they report to me since you're an employee under me
It's rough. The satellite internet on my yachts mini yacht is like 1% slower than my main yacht's :(
My head cannon is that Zeli is a tax collector
yea uhhh phantom I dunno how that ends up happening - but its not 0 so it works KEKW
I'm not your employee @monado Not since you retired
I couldn't find the consistency for this clawshot target so I just jump to that wall
Why can't I be a tax preparer :( It's so much more fun to be helpful to friends than punishing to random people
I'm certain there is too but it was annoying lmao
is there anything more going on past flat grey on that wall even?
I demand a reclassification and then I will return to being your employee
Would you like a 10% pay increase
@Monado KappaPride is that 10% of 0 or off of something KEKW
Not you Phantom, not everything is about you
Only if you let me be a friendly tax preparer and not a mean collector l
@Jonxhas Shhh, don't let him know
Phantom, you have to be a valuable employee if you want a raise
@Zeliversal You can be whatever your heart desires
I am full service for Monado. I can prepare taxes, fix bots, make alerts, provide entertainment, serve on the benefits advisory board, etc.
All while getting paid in exposure
Yeah those RSU's are more worthless than toilet paper
But they're worth something to me
Cheer100 I've got your raise right here (kaching)(bong)(yahoo)
Is it because you have my signature
Yo one of my old PBs did something similare
Someone’s sub 3 run did that KEKW
Ok. I think I have an idea that will make everyone happy
I just hate the TP doors alltogether
something about them which is stupid
I like to stand to the left of the lock it’s a bit easier
It's very satisfying seeing your sum of best fall every time I check in
oh shit I didn’t realize how little you’ve practiced this is damn good then
bane of my feels for MM and OoT at this rate KEKW
I think the one cycle strat is pretty heavy RNG as well
My muscle memory was waiting for the bomb refill then I realized lmao
okay that one gets noted down
didnt know you could do that
Ball and chain strat is so cool on this fight
final zant phase is a paintrain imo
i used ball and chain when he spins
if that works consistently, I feel sooo dumb from doing the TP cheevo set
yeah he kind of pinballs around. but it keeps you from taking damage
Do you think you’ll revisit paper Mario 64 at all PauseChamp
is it the one where midna waggles her arms around
and then link holds her in the rain
i got stuck in hyrule castle so im interested to see how im supposed to clear some of the rooms
No bonk into squidna? reset run NOPERS
where at if you recall toma?
its a room with 2 unlit torches
and a stairway that doesn't go up all the way
because its like im missing a torch
yea so right after the darknut
"my gremlin wife is ragdolling herself into the walls and pillars, should I be concerned/
"No, this is healthy behavior for gremlins. Just hold her firmly after she returns to normal."
maybe that gremlin wife just wanted to become a wall gremlin
"I'M IN YOUR WAAAALLS" and all that KEKW
I'm in your SHADOW, in this case
eyyy where you can skip these you're allowed to!
was wondering if that was on that edge case area'n all that
I wonder why barrier skip would be allowed tbh
"game: its for your magic armor so you can use the ganondorf amiibo"
except wii and gc didnt know amiibo would exist KEKW
in the frikkin friends we made along the way
I fat fingered that early oops
wanna stress that there's only 3 which actually did things here
one of them rly just exists
Facts bro could’ve at least did the skyhook quest for us
@Midnaliin better: he coulda also had a bow
but didnt consider coming with more then a book to a fight
to be fair he made two mistakes during the campaign
he allocated all his points into the wrong skills
He just lowkey doesn’t care about Link only the book lore
all in intellect, nothing in perception agility or dexterity yea
What if Ganondorf is up there?
It’s okay Zeli it’s just Zelda
Oh shit we counting Zeggs? 1,
Zelda has strep its okay she’ll be fine
whats best cycle case, excluding type of cycle?
imagine accidentally reversing your stereo and having to do zant + ganon
gotta love Ganon going for stroll
he had enough imprisonment, wants some walkies
he did summon it after all, makes sense
bet he stole that horse from phantom ganon
actually didn't he steal that blade from the dead sage
it was the one that was pierced in him
almost as if this game has a wee bit more exec, less rng influence?
we get what. u and i have two different ideas
like - obviously there's not none
@TomaThePolliwog the afterlife came quick for zant I bet
you should raid toma but tomorrow when hes actually not on break from tp
I bet 99% of your viewers would like them
you should raid yourself this is true
He's about to start a run too
idk i feel like imp midna had better thighs
ads AngyTwink oh wait i have turbo
@TomaThePolliwog Phantom, can I ban this person
Bedge time, have a great night everyone and ty for the stream!
hmm should i add that here
Great job on the solid PB. Hope u have a great rest of day/night.
Hey I mean...we all go through hell
ohh its not a pikacha. my god
oh that was a file name i got here after they said it KEKW
Cause that's all Chaud is good for
last 2 times i joined mid run you were cussing out link cuz he was being a little douchebag
where's the dog i was promised dog
they made this whole mechanic blowing grass and then you get an item for it right?
i guess i can wait 10 minutes or so
we can wait 10 mins as a treat
i've never seen someone flex by holding a fishing pole like that
L target is better in this game than it is in echoes of wisdom
i want this run to die
when will ice do a tp run?
You got called out on ice
I knew that was gonna happen lolz
nah i just have 0 interest in learning 3d zelda games. hence why i bailed on oot so fast
i can imagine oot being ridiculous to learn with the zillion glitches
i should sub 4 that category when i take a break from MM
Morph just come learn zelda 2
i've still not played zelda 2 tbh, never got around to it
i almost had a low 3:58 in my pb but died to ganon lol
set yourself a real goal @morpheus080! sub 3:35
yeah i took damage on a roll frame that didn't give me knockback
link was a bad boy? tippiLurk
gl on the run or runs
so i didn't know i was low health until it was too late and died
also thank for the answers, might help me figure out things a bit
if okay, I will keep ya posted?
@stalkor i do not play 3d zelda to grind glitchless like that so that's not likely for me OMEGALUL
those 3 in that order to what happened all fit KEKW
i finally rerecorded my pullstring lines for that redeem on my stream and moved that all the way over to twitch's alerts last night
are we sure that wasn't the same VO as Shadow?
ooo ooo im also now at 40k/50k to give u a rando
i saw the text in red and was worried for a second lmao
question tho phantom what rando would u wana do if u had to pick
how much for pokemon ranger i havent seen that game in so long lmao
why is gold wolf banned for setting for tp
bcuz also includes all the howling stones
either way ur probs gonna get a minish seed :P
i only know pokemon ranger for the ds, and all i remember  is drawing ALOT of circles
like everyone else i forget that feature
ass so big it can crash the game
Now we know. Phan likes ass
GDQ is finally using their bsky account
Hey all. Success has been had. Chili did not burn kitchen down and is donezo
How has gamin and chat been?
@AnniLyn2 splendid the winner was carrots and garlic
congrats on... *checks notes* not burning down your kitchen?
im so used to lja flying in this place the rotations (wood) give me panics.
can't go sideways on a ladder
Nobody likes that joke lolz my second time making it
oh hey the beeping doesnt continue during the cutscene!
actually thought it would just continue through that
I always thought it to be a thing cus of the Bosskey and hyrule castle wind spinner "puzzle"
so the Z on the ground or the ligtning to follor respectively - had huge issues w it not activating unless seen every time, but could be that it needs the rang throw to be targeting them
and a red I think - some such - nothin of big value in vanilla
either way: am talkin from big "feels like it" vibes to it cus I dunno if its actually like that or not
yea - dunno, it rly shouldnt be but then again its nintendo
and if I learned anything from OoT and MM, its that there's at times STUPID silly things happening cus of draw distance
dog on strike from u being mean other day
fave cutscene in the game bc its right
You can skip that door opening cutscene
I went through Beasts PB and manually entered his WR splits for a comparison a few days ago
They aren't the same as mine either, which is why I needed to do it manually lol
That's a good way to let you know I'm in danger
the moment I start liking mcdeez is when I give up my tastebuds
I worked at McDonald's in highschool so I just don't enjoy it anymore
over here mcdeez is shit to the point where no matter what you want from them, they all taste like freshly unpacked plastic
They're also too expensive for the good quality
I mean I've had worse than McDonalds, but yeah it's not great...
whats the worst thing you made in the mcd @monado ?
Oh I didn't make the food, I was a cashier
compared to mcdeez, round here at least, BK is more where you'd want do be
But I was around it enough
in n out fries are literal cardboard though
honestly im a slut for any and all french fries
Fries are kinda outta my radar diet its all mashed potatoes and homefries for me.
the only thing i've been enjoying at wendy's is their mushroom bacon cheeseburger
five guys fries. yum but also a whole sack of potatoes
I honestly cant say I could rly enjoy any fast food fries unless they're made in belgium as stupid as that might sound
Oh fuuuuck you're so real for that stalkor
something they do where it "just" tastes like slightly salted tato sticks - aka what you'd expect the taste to be
Five Guys prices barely went up either, everything else did so it's more worth your money now lol
I think my favorite fast food burger is Braums
its stupid what you get for a medium fries. it feeds 4 kids for a week
One of my friends worked at Five Guys and while it's expensive, everything is made to order and it's fresh beef they get delivered every day, not frozen crap
I think Braums is mostly just in the southern midwest though
So it is definitely higher tier fast food
no way you walked into his ass
I swear, twitch needs to figure out why the fuck ads playing desyncs audio and video
wtf they just uninstalled your bridge
but have seen it on both
@Jonxhas I would tell u my adblocker but lawyers are everywhere.
oh firefox has it worse yea. i switched to chrome. has better adblock
does it once manifest v3 comes into play?
adblock on chrome is essentially ded then KEKW
my ublock still work on youtube
"kinda" - as long as manifest v2 related addons work still
I forgot what the dates are but its similar stupid to saying win10 shall not have security updates
will be iffy til I see it actually not being an issue there then
that yea - which in itself also is an issue but different thing
either way: the fact the audio video desync has been going on for literal years on twitch now and still hsant been adressed is utter garbo
like - yea, you got amazon breathin down your neck, but that sounds like the type of videoplayer desync issue which SHOULD be easy to figure out
I should be able to see that via browser console, no?
avarie1Notes ghunzoNOTED phanto274Notes thepri67Notes tippiNotes reads well
what were the terms you said it could be again?
afaik twitch does encoding type things on server side, at least thats what I heard last
oh nvm you can easily find that whole thin out KEKW
its listing mp4 files under advanced stats for the strm
so settings -> advanced -> show stats where ya can also see latency and whatnot
hell - they could enforce a "post ad reload"
rather then trying so hard to let it just continue in the background while something else is overlaying
cus desync or flatout muting of the stream cus an ad played is rly not a good user experience
lemme guess - they were hoping to get a 10yr senior
I aint ever gonna have an understanding towards the decision to only search for masters upwards senioss
like - as if everyone comes out of highschool with a masters in exactly what you want, having breathed the field of expertise since kindergarden
showing the eagerness to learn should be prime positive
especially given that UI handling last I recall is heaps easier
compared to writing a videoplayer WITH dynamic UI elements
like - correct me if I am lookin at this silly like, but "just UI" is silly
and lookin at the BotW UI system they used in TotK and Echoes? that thing's got some GLARING issues
never had a digital TCG lock up on my so much
well... fingers crossed it isnt gonna look like that for me - given the details I outlined in dms and all
also I DESPISE the avatars man I would prefer nothing KEKW
cus like - imagine just having the money to get all the hardware needed to mess with in private
or better yet just give us 8bit trainers like the games or something
not these grubhub commercial ass avatars
like in OoT to the fire side of things KEKW
where it DOES NOT tell you that
that is such a troll nintendo fuck you KEKW
dinner time gl on rest of run
why is zora armor more optimal over green tunic?
ah so its just the menuing timesave
so an entire open and close menu which otherwise would be attached
god am I happy rn to have the old thermo layer of my old jacket still
freezing temps outside and the heater by what I can gauge is turned off
like - not my room but entirew building
Mario paint was good and then I did like 3hrs of MM practice butter15Smile
is sub 6 considered good for this run
That's why my goal is sub 5:50 lol
I'm honestly surprised more people haven't ran TP Glitchless, I know its quite long but something like TTYD had tons of people running Any% back in the day when it was like 6 hours long
I gotta run to the store before it becomes too late so I'mma go do that
Hope the run is good in the meantime though <3
I wonder how Wii leaderboards are for glitchless
Which version do you think is more fun to run, wii or gc?
i thought we saved this dude in MM why he still trying to kill us Madge
but is he tryin to kill us or test us
OOOOR is it just another silly skullkid scheme
look a dark, orange ornamented crystal!
interesting that the roundabout walk is quicker then swimming to me
gotta have the hero in green, cant have that be blue which is silly
gonna try for some more sleep
its too cold and I cant always keep awake in local morning
need to actually shift that somehow
as much as its shit w current "warmth"
Yo Phantom gl on the run today!
I wanna pet the Link wolf
Just the best thousand yr doorer
haven't seen a glitch run in a bit only did some gltiched speedrun of the wiiu version
it's kinda funny how the glitches are almost identical despite them trying to patch it
those two glitches save so much on sd compared to hd
just helps it get started faster
ghunzoLove thepri67Love rhacodLove AmbessaLove tippiLove laserg8Heart phanto274Heart
he dodge the tip of your sword this time
You can actually just aim the camera up after getting the rod and hit it through the floor
still faster than waiting for night
why must you make midna say "what is it, daddy?"
Why are there so many ass shots of midna in this game
Is that the bridge of elden
it's the smashy stage from the game you can trip and slip in
Of all places in TP why a random bridge
Something not right abt midna saying "What is it daddy"
that's a hell of a sentence to come into
"Who are you.......Daddy? You sure thats right?"
Daddy do not show her your rod
I am not looking down there
Phantom thanks I am playing "casually" and not have done in many years. Was looking for the last howling stone and I forgot there was one in Kak
There were a few dungeons I got lost LOL cause I have not done casually in a very long time
time for my least favorite dungeon, appearance really cool; gameplay... uhggg
the first time playing it got lost on one of the sides for hours
I remember some runners doing that without boots
Sorry about all the typos, my keyboard is starting to fail

I get to make her play minish cap now LUL
i will GLADLY take minish cap over ever touching another rhythm heaven game
btw phantom, Banjo 4.2 just dropped
Signposts can now contain AP Hints. Signposts can also be Checks... Signsanity!!
You mean getting to the boss key reverse order?
which i didnt even know was possible
I could never get that consistent though
but i bugged out the menus
and couldnt select anything, including exit menu
If I ever run glitchless TP again I will look more into it
i was 20 minutes ahead of PB
oh, if you turn everything on its now at 1018 checks
Ya, the rang LJA is pretty free
You in about 3 minutes LOL
How vulgar / none PC are we allowed to be in your filename redeems?
Just vulgar and funny, like Daddy LMAO
i am not a bot. i am just like you, the other chatters. haha
how's the run been, been away for a bit
“Can you enter Zant quickly” ayo
dont you hate it when youre fighting for your life and you get ten dollars
uhm actually nerdCheck that's a BIG key
i was looking for an emote to make that exact message arie OMEGALUL
you jumped off a cliff and walked in through a different door
you get even more free time save after sword of light
i think he just says "you"
phanto274Pacepal Phantom on pace? LETS GO!
Barrier was not there I do not think, Kargarok hit you
that fight always makes me laugh. like hes finally sick of getting his ass beat he just goes "enough"
hmm i wonder who you will raid tonight Kappa
I think City and Palace, do a couple of ILs and you will pb and sub 6 in no time.
I think you are doing quite well
thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Oh phantom did you change your Oengus password
Yeah I log in with twitch myself
Let Phantom5800 know you want to drop in and collaborate!
The new boba fruit teas are really good
There's a blueberry lemonade one now
blueberry lemonade is just fuckin good
If you get a chance to try the Cherry Blossom one
I am loving this tp grind
yeah not really hard to make lemonade
Idk all of their Boba Fruit teas are incredibly good
how much did you order last time holy shit
They saw the filename and were like "gotta dip"
"Your package was shipped on 2/5!" why the fuck are you using past tense, it's the fourth
Damn if this was echoes of wisdom you would of lost like 12 seconds to rupee cutscenes
sweet christ i'm gonna be ahead of you and monado within a literal minute, neither of you do that
did you know if you herd 21/20 goats you get fucked in the ass by a dommy mommy
@TheGlubbers damn i gotta start tp speedruns soon then
Yo morph gl getting fucked in the ass
Yo ty glubbers for the gl in getting fucked in the ass
This cutscene is longer than Echoes of Wisdom any% U
its almost like you could do a roll by performing 2 180s and save minor time demNerd
Mr Phantom why did you reduce your height for any%
This is what Lan does when he's not virus busting
Just beats the shit out of training dummies
no but i do know how to do a quickspin
quickspins cant be preformed by a human
nono feli you see, i was named explicitly in that song so i can
You don't wanna grab the cock?
just like i love golden rods
fuck yeah those pipes are so tight GaySex
Well guess I'm getting a head start
fair enough i don't care about this job
Yo stravos! Things are good here, just a little sick
I would unironically do a race this week if you wanted
I don't even own this game
I'm sure you got your legal copy on hand
I don't even have a modded console to get this game legally
Your PC probably has a modded console on it
The day I ever play on emulator
dont know what ur on about
I am WAY too sensitive to input lag
Pretty sure you can midna jump from the ground there too
@Monado it's the reverse with that one, you don't midna jump from the ground, you can make the jump without midna jumps
yeah the midna jump up to the house at first?
however i do bother doing 2 180 degree turns into a quick roll input
Nah Phantom fell off the platform after scaring the guy into the water and I'm pretty sure if you fall you can active midna from the ground
That's what I was referring to
he uses splits as route docs
have you seen him run super metroid 100%
you can autosplit for TP, it's just kinda complicated to set up
i imagine you'd just autosplit for item pickup textboxes no
that's what marco does, textboxes seem consistent
yeah item pickup textboxes is what people have done in the past
This is why I use a split pedal
i run TP and EoW. the answer to that is just yes.
I'm just gonna speed it through
is there a chance of reset else i can redeem another banger
Ask morph if he's ok with it
cant you push the monkey to speed it up?
Yeah that's why generally you don't wanna do it, it's just time loss if it's too far
Your new line better be "LETS REV IT UP!'
I was gonna say what did the hero's shade ever do, bad comparison
Beats me, my brain is weird
apperently i got a giftsub popesSmash
That fucking subathon is taking longer than I thought it would
Did you activate polymerization to fuse that shadow?
Or is it more contact fusion?
Contact fusion isn't even a thing, it's anime bullshit
Yeah but it's special summon not contact fusion
Contact fusion is a widely recognized fan term for "Open state special summon fusion monster"
At least in season 4 they fixed that
The one fucking season that only aired in Japan
the final ep of 5ds is so good
The censored ones are worth it
Because what's better than revving it up?
Something I never got is why yusei is just that stale all throughout the series
He never goes through something like yugi or jaden
I mean. He only had to deal with the trama of knowing his dad exploded himself and then the guy who adopted Jack and his brother forced it to happen
I watched it, meh, felt like rewritten digital monsters
Yeah zeli but he didn't fucking die at some point
Did you not watch the show?
If you're counting at the end that shit doesn't count
I need to remember where it was
When he falls into the Ener D reactor with Roman after their duel and he sees his dad's spirit
Right before they all duel double signer rex
It's also been like 8 years
It is heavily stated he was sent to the netherworld. But his dad's spirit helps him not get caught by the dread
I've never watched any yugioh so I have no clue what any of those words mean.
Wouldn't surprise considering rex wanted to kill everyone
And then he came back to life as to not abandon his card game motorcycle
I'm still mad 4 kids didn't air when Jack had his dragon upgraded
It has a massive jump between episodes in 4kids
It's not as visible because I think time line reset or some shit? I don't recall
Mr Phantom would you consider getting taller?
Ok. Well thank you for your consideration in considering it
@theglubbers come here fucker I'm gonna make you an NBA baller
Oh you said milk, I heard smoke
But to be fair the chief does look like he'd smoke Marlboro
Or slap my tits and call me Cindy that works
What’s the WR for this category?
Reminds me of old hundo days
I thought DF was in there somewhere.
It used to be like a 10 min and then 20 min difference
Hey Phantom, IIRC at one time he was first.
Tbh I've never cared for glitchless for the same contradiction in tech for what could and couldn't be considered a glitch
i fell off so many times the fairy revived me on the bridge and i still game overed
its probably not 100% but im only one stamp and cave of shadows away from full completion
yeah when i think of 100 now i think of like randomizer 100
when i did mine we slapped each other at the same time, if you mash fast enough you can still push him i think
Fire in a wooden shield, doesn't burn
wow BNLC has already sold 1.6 million. that's big
i was shocked at how short hyrule castle is but i guess part of it is also like earlier carrying midna
Yo gl on the run Phantom!
Yeah hyrule is included for MDH
But also lakebed is long as shit
Mr Phantom. What are you doing outside of Temple of the Ocean King and Tower of Spirits?
Guess who suggested it and then they timed it
Swift is less than this guy
Zeli go shove your comment up your ass
You can write it on a piece of paper and then all in
I don't have a piece of paper
that was the coolest switch tech ive ever seen
Don't tell me there's a pot push here too
I did not even know pot jump was a think LOL
Every single zelda I've seen or tried to run has a strat including a pot I swear
Would it be worth it to just kill the bublins?
if theres more than two enemies on screen, targeting is impossible
i feel like targeting in this game is worse than oot
I feel it better than oot, oot and mm are trash at targeting
it needs to really take into account where the camera is facing
but also, during the ganon fight its useful for it to not do that
ganon is the only time you ever need to target behind
I used to run the JP glitchless too, once I started getting better the game became so frustrating.
Did you know you do not need to shoot the rope?
Ya, dont worry about 3 seconds until you need to worry about it
Either way, it is good to see you getting better all the time.
ya, in glitchless categories it is all about consistent movement.
I hate oot glitchless because it's all ess turns
I get it's comsistent but without the adapter it's just trash
Zeldamon: Gale Boomerang of Darkness TP
Yeah it's pretty much oot to blame for allowing adapters
I mean if it's mini I'm not surprised
But still Jesus allowing the adapter
Is there a deadzone / ESS limit for the adapters?
Well they had to add no changing values mid run
Because yes some changed their  values
Well unbuffered and I'm guessing keeping the speed
I wonder if they see normal bokos or the twilight one
@swiftpichu_ Yeah I’m with you on that lol
I am almost done with my 3 heart randomizer seed. Not 3 hearts by choice, though. This seed was… Something, alright.
I chose the setting that purges everything ‘unnecessary’ from every dungeon check. And somehow I still had to do nearly every single check to get the butter sword.
I didn’t think hearts were ‘unnecessary’.
@zeliversal if you share with me
I will share a singular dollar with you in 20 years
i just realized i don't think i ever paused the game as wolf link
Can anyone here glaze my waffles?
your friend wants someone to glaze your waffles?
why is your friend so caring
Oh right you guys don't know me, hi, I'm a fucking pig
shouldn't your friend just glaze your waffles then?'
if they care so much about it
The same way Epona can hear the ocarina in OoT/MM
horses can hear from about 2.78 miles away
rabbits are a little less at 2 miles
rabbits have a wider hearing range than horses
its weird because you'd think rabbits can hear farther away because their ears are like satellite dishes
I wasnt watching, but dont you just hit A once and pull bow and its line up perfect?
Is the main difference is you can S&Q in Glitchless, but not JP?
Or are there specific tricks for each category
AHH even the spinner one in Snowpeak?
Ill have to stay tuned :)
I think it would be cool to see a glitchless run that combines the fast stuff allowed between both categories
When I was running we had to do a bomb boost
yeah that 100% a glitch KEKW
I dont think bomb boost are a glitch, but if you want to run a category you play by that ruleset.
THat makes sense, except for the last one before the last darknut by the final bosses
The first 2 I dont think are glitches, you are going around them not actually skipping them
it was more curious, just too lazy to look it up even though it takes longer to ask you and chat questions instead :) Interraction
Never owned a wii u, and I dont care for remakes.
Unless its a remake with new good content
I could get it for CEMU I suppose
in hd though overall you might get less rupees because of stamps
@TomaThePolliwog Its funny you mention that, because I feel like due to TP forcing you to put rupees back if you can't hold them in SD will cause you to lose more
OH Lakebed without the boost to toad,
this should be good to see too
Cause nobody will be coming back to a dungeon just for a rupee chest
I actually like a lot of what lakebed does in glitchless
Skips enough and feels good to do right
Definitely worth the little time to set up
This is normal, the backup if you miss the damage boost from the reverse side.
or if a person sucks at the bomb boost off of the chest they always do it this way
its 7th red flash, and you get 2 frames
For me, worst part about glitchless runs is not bonking
Knowing when to roll and when to not
especially when rolling toward doors "can I roll 1 more time"
TBH I am most interested in snowpeak, becuase most of this is the same if you do not do the chest bomb boost
Watching you makes me wants to start practicing again
So you gotta go through the turning room?
Spike room is both, but the elevator turning we dont see.
i missed a heart container here and had to go back and i wanted to die
Back in the day, we timed it to actually swim through again then S&Q
yeah piece. it was in a side tunnel where water flows you have to use iron boots
Depending where you place the stairs
It was not by much though, <1 second
Well Adam tested it, and I trusthim
Ya, I have been liking watching you this last week and our interraction
nice rhone welcome to our ghostly pack
the only way they could have made this game better for me is if they had a vaati fight in like a mirror room
and if they changed the ending
Thinking of filename for next run Kappa
because whenever you get these artifacts theres always a lot of like wind swirling around
So far except for Save and Quit, the run is really similar
since JP I think allows damage boost for Dom Rod
hardest part of no save and quit having the aeroflos kill u through the fence gate to get the klaw
@RhoneRanger2001 no u cant it kills run if u do it glitchless
Same. Like yesterday for double claw you sucked at it, but for key in castle you did it perfect.
@stavros12c34anenoglou True, that is why I said do it right LOL
Mr Phantom. I have a max revive for your Midna. I shipped it directly to Zelda for easy pickup
I hope you find this acceptable
DUDE I did that yesterday, that exact thing I was so mat
yep Zeli, i walked away cause I was that angry
These puppets have always freaked me out, for 30 + years, no necks and their heads just spin
Not sure if you knew, but if you shoot the watchtower dude first, they will not send the rest after you
you can skip this too if you hit him before the CS
To be honest, we had no SnQ when I ran, so it was usually night
ok, excited to see Arbiters now without the tricks.
I just know if you kill the watch tower dude first, he cant warn the others
Its not too precise, if you struggle can always switch to wolf
So the main changes are after the 4 poes?
Because so far its the same
There is an arrow drop in Arbiters I always get
but that might be only in JP
BTW DS Skip I believe is allowed, becasue it is an enemy LJA right?
dont need to move the elevator at all
Ya, in JP never saw these rooms
This room JP does, but in revers order
So not huge difference, but because of no BK early makes it somewhat easier
You should watch what I do here
I'll do 3 stabs, step back slightly, then repeat
Even if some slashes don't connect/do damage it still keeps him stunned
Time slashes so you do not do the 4th mega hit, and you can do it
that might help me if I go back to this
I assume if you get there on the first cycle?
Ya, I just hate that area so much
SO arbiters is a little different but not much, stallord is the same
Snowpeak I am curious to see
Its fine, but can you at least show me snowpeak differences if you decide to reset?
I think you'll still be ahead, or barely not
ya, I dont care to much about ToT, that is about the same
I want to see Snowpeack and how ENG glitchless does it
Phantom your streams have been keeping me sane so thank you ukyotpPray
Is where those things move random?
My car didn’t start this morning -36
I had to walk in then my coworker drove me home KEKW
How is speedrunning tp anyways? Been considering learning a category in it at some point
Dilly, find a game you raelly like
It’s only a 15 minute walk tbf lol
Like Paper Mario is an ez game and WR is free Kappa
@RhoneRanger2001 There are a lot of those lmao, on the rope between tp, majora and oot
I mean, if you like OOT
but then just play the game casually a few times and get to know the game first.
Well Majora all fairy rewards is most enticing, cause I just really like fairies
Okay, so do it casually first
until you are able to get all the fairy rewards
Then learn the simple things, like superslides, weirdshots and boosts
Just do what you want, but it is mandatory to know where things are.
So first just play a few times with my current knowledge then?
make sure you know where the fairies are at
Taking notes on the cave movement
Then start learning tricks on or 2 at a time
At least that is my advise, you need to know where they are before you know and understand how to get them faster.
Yeah mainly to do that and avoid the keese
Okay, so Phantom, you said snowhead is quite different than jp?
SIMPLE tip, to save .5 seconds, if there are double doors go to the Right door to open
Ya like that see? saves link from sliding over
Phantom, in JP glitchless we get no soup ingredients
So ya, this is way different
JP uses spinner boost to the other side, then fire this cannon
Back when I ran we did not do LFC, we did Iron Boots bomb boost
Which I am not sure, but I think may be faster?
Phantom are we racing AD this weekend phanto274Mash
Ya, snowpeak is very different from what I remember. But it is very cool to see.
My only run was 5:12 so far lol
I lost more time to dangoro and not picking up the dominion rod than I did to any major tricks KEKW
so its a 4 person battle next month?
Bro was looking like “whatcha doin on the ladder”
Ya, this is quite a bit different, but still quite fun, unless you die to Blizetta..
If you want to stop, I understand
this run has been sad for many reasons but that one was the saddest
But its cool to see how different it is
i can only wish better luck next time
I assume City and Palace  and Castle are about the same?
THat is only a jump off the side during Argorok
Ithought you meant during the fight
heard the run's takin a bit of a nosedive, still hope you're well PrideFlower runs cookin some decent bits here'n there
I’m heading to Bedge good luck with the Glodders chicken
here's fingers crossed for a "normal" armogohma given RNG then
and not a perfect RNG one KEKW
cus that would suck BALLS for future runs
you got a double via the JA again
the hitbox of MS seems to be MASSIVE behind link
literally hit like half a link behind him
cus lining up 3 of them is harsh yea
that one helmasaur helmet too close monkaW
There should be pots in here
lrighty then solid go at it today
They hit.  Got hit with 2 as I waddled in then a group of 8 haha
Hey Phan...can I have a favor?
always room for a thats never happened before moment
Probably just...words of encouragement to continue?
I mean if I cut off my foot then yeah it should pass
Hey that was the goat that responds late to whoops
That i could make about link being wet lumbeaRhmm
you should already be fighting ganon at this point come on
Wrong warp from ordon to the final battle.
don't tell that to UNDERTALE fans
Guess Goats on the menu boys
The poor goats. They just didn't feel like inning today
You kind of just wait for them to be in a line and foward b attack without targeting
Hallo! Good luck on the run!
I get a DM on my etsy
“can you please make me a new one”
@Allegrenix i visited etsy today and came acroos egyptian god slimes where its the ra and slifer version. Majorly epic.
So I go, maybe they’ve bought from me before and are wanting a replacement
Nope, they’ve never bought from me
“What do you mean, make you a new one? A new one what?”
Next day I get a reply
Just try and guess what they said
And no cheating and looking at my bluesky where I posted the conversation
today back in 2001 paper mario was release didn't need another reminding that i am old Deadge
I mean I’m fine with making new characters
In fact I like that more
I like kok please give me kok
damn not even a hi 1st Sadge
I'm gonna go have an enema
Fuck off I had a shiny in quote form
Fuck it really was a shiny
Wouldn't that be your standard boko?
These are just in their goth phase
I did prove it is possible though
Are the moves he does here random, or is there a way to predict if he'll slap or not?
And thank you for the expo of why iron boots splits suck ass
But hey you still got your dignity
So is tp considered one of the harder runs, because it's longer, or are the tricks also harder to perform?
I see, what I'm struggling with in majora right now is consistently performing easier tricks that require quick button presses like bomb hovering. Anything similar in this game?
Slapping a goron nipple mst be paintful, considering you're basically slapping a rock
Hello mister Link. I am a Midna hanging onto your shadow. Every time you roll, my grip loosens. I am about to fall off. Please stop. Thank You.
who up mountin' they horse from behind modCheck
i need to figure out what to get for dinner
I still have never done a complete run of any Zelda game lol
I’ve tried alttp, wind waker, oot, and mm lol
phantom, found a game for you to run multiworld in
and every time I went “eh I don’t like it” lol
"thats okay" so youre fine with it? cool beans!
so would you wait for beta then?
last night I did a banjo seed with the new update. win con 6 out of 8 bosses. I hade to hint my chain for the 6th boss and it took my 7.5 hours. Im still new tho and want to learn the game.
when i watch people run those settings in multi world it takes them around 3 hours
probably one of the worst parts of this game ngl
i hate pretty much all of the twilight sections except for the very first time you wake up as a wolf and i think this is the worst one
And thats why in the HD version they made it less ass
magic hand comes out to poke the bug to death lol
Yo Phantom, GL with the speedrun
Mario the red Link I think
@Luey_Gaming_Guy oh from four swords i gotchu
I bet that's caused some heated discussion in the uma musume community
wait that is a great comment
don't worry i have already taped my eyes shut
I'll come back to you on that when I reach that part on my current playthrough
Gotta say though, replaying all the Zelda games I remember from my childhood reminds me just how simple the puzzles I struggled with as a kid actually were
Even the bug hunting sections aren't as bad as I remember
cheer100 You almost got you access it automatically? Since I was practicing stuff for casual play of that long ago and it becomes a magic meter, right?
outing is done and nice solid start. Cooking and Lurking
gotta go clean this eel’s teeth
Is Jerry a name the community gave him, or just something you came up with?
Well I bet that tektite that interrupted your trick is named Marvin
no, I can't remember ever having trouble with the tektites
No no. How do you classify this as gaming?
This is all just a figment of Midna's mind control
We arent expressing free will. We are just doing the run as she wants us to
And by we. I mean you.
And by you. I mean her
Midna's the best companion for a reason
MIDNA is pressing buttons and wolf link is running
@Zeliversal But how is Midna pressing buttons, when this is the section where she's dying
She's dying because Link was too slow
And the run was too slow
She's panting because she's pressing buttons faster
Time to add the 7tv emote
Besides, who needs emotes from a retired streamer
Well, I seemed to have lost track of time and unfortunately still need to sleep tonight. Good luck with the rest of the run!
Also appreciate you answering the questions I had today
I don't know how to tell you this @amishman19
You look at emotes, not listen to them
Listen, I hear with my ears
I can’t believe I typo’d when I was trying to use eyes
I half believe my autocorrect changed it when I looked away
I think you need to just admit you're wrong
Listen Zeli, I’ll admit I’m wrong when my eyes start listening
I feel like TP has one of the best stories to enjoy casually, what is your opinion on it?
is that a quality of life boar? is there a slider for that?
omg it is a QOL boar phanto274ColonD
Ok we're gonna review this again
It's okay. Everyone makes mistakes. Just study.
That enemy is such a gentleman, just kindly waiting for you to pull the chain
I meant to ask earlier, the guy who turned into gold, do you ever see him again in 100%?
@monado it’s been yeah, you’re right
heyo, how goes Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess?
We were playing that Remake of Silent hill 2
It's been a lot of fun~
that's gonna be great if you can do it- Good luck!
cooking be done and i missed BonyBoy
did you practice before this run Susge
Oh fuck yeah Morph too? LETSGO
Thank you again for the help earlier Phantom, which json I’m I exporting to remove the horizontal bit from? I feel like I haven’t found the right one yet
that’s no big deal, I’ll poke around and ask again later when you’re not in the middle of a run if I can’t find it phanto274Smile
Did he clank on your shield somehow
Best dungeon time Lets rock this phantom
is this the slash over the fence room?
Okay no I was getting my rooms mixed up
Are you on PB pace PauseChamp
I don’t think I’ve seen a 100% run, I’ll have to tune in when you do it phanto274Smile
im not arachnophobic but this is the worst fight in the game because the gimmick is dumb
the dragon isnt that fun either. as a casual fight its just hectic and if you fall you lose 2 minutes to getting back up there
oh right the nice carriage lady
That’s the only reason I remember her phanto274Smile
Mr Phantom you're making the people cry because they're so happy to have a puppy running around time
i've been playing ff7 rebirth between practice/runs and honestly the overworld bloat is wild to me
i like the rest of the game a lot at least
i do appreciate how much unique dialogue there is
but god damn is there a fuck ton
ff7 the best character and world building ever
not a lot cuz im not huge on card games
but i can see the appeal from the forced parts i had to play
oh is there a storyline behind it
i got my ass beat by wize the robot on the way to costa del sol which was pretty funny
i was his first victory OMEGALUL
i'll prob mess with it more then, didn't know it ran deep
i just thought it was another triple triad/blitzball/etc.
I just finished a semi-casual playthrough of TP to re-learn the game
Ya, got lost a couple times like I mentioned last night.
i just finished going through costa del sol with the hojo fight at the end
iirc should be golden saucer iirc, been a while
gl on the last bit of the run PrideFlower
funky kinda how the wooden shield is just the shield to to through the run with PrideFlower like - yea, hylian shield doesnt add shit, still looks silly
I thought there was a chest somewhere, maybe in Castle that has a chest with Hylian shield?
all the reasons you could have for it end at bomb arrows as well
in castle town a goron shop I think, for like 200
but dont recall if wooden or hylian
plus you could never lose hylian even if you wanted post getting it
so who would ever buy the metal plate there
Goodness i love this fight so much!
I think this is the worst room in the game to do well
Ya, and the fans go SO slow, so if you miss the shot there is 30-45 seconds
basically: double clawshot is a fun idea. it being hugely tied to forced waiting is kinda sad
yus MAN you could do cool things with this concept both for traversal and for combat
turn them into whip style 2hand grabbies
but all the big, fun ideas to that end sadly seem to have mellowed out towards the ball & chain in the end, given spinner AND double clawshot are in that "they are cool, BUT - "area
Damn it, I forgot to give my peahats rain umbrellas again Madge
if ya could clawshot into rocks for climbing instead of targets only, that woulda been grand
we LOVE animations blocking pause menu interactions 🙃
still no understanding why that specifically was brought into this game after we did not need it in mario either
the zant heads usually drop some no?
yeah i remember all the pots being empty
if only the forbidden scripts of rando would have reached all pots already 😅
past just what ppl have manually dug out I mean
kinda hilarious come to think how little the requirements would be if the PoT warp would be open items wise
like - clawshot, wolf for the items mostly
and then zant having the boatload of requirements for the fight
"I cant fight zant for heart container, I still need <pick between boomerang, iron boots, zora armor, ball&chain and swords"
hilarious come to think how little puzzle related use the bow has in this game
i blame miyamoto for having like four different spider enemies in this game
I ran my dishwasher at 8 and it’s still not done. getting close to quiet hours I didn’t realize how long a dishwasher runs KEKW
skullwalltulas, big and medium skulltulas are the 3 I can think of for spiders
theres also the crablike ones in the water temple
It’s not crazy loud but I’m worried people will complain lol
usually a dishwasher program goes for like 2 hours, also if its that loud how did ya stack your stuff PrideLaugh
nah dishwasher no one should complain
if you were to wash your clothes and it goes into the last 10 minutes, maybe
otherwise you'd have to be worried about a fridge
Okay that’s true I’m probably overthinking it KEKW
and WHO would complain about you preserving your food
like - what would make a difference is if you were manually doin the dishes super loudly and even THAT to my understanding if you're not doing it for longer then say, 5m imo should be fine
think "whoops, a glass or similar fell, need to clean the newly created hazard"
have seen it too much when I did retrocheevos for this game
always the same mask he comes out of here?
Okay as I was talking about it the dishwasher shut off… that thing is sentient
@Midnaliin usual dishwasher programs I know of are 90m to (if intensive) 2h
though the manual of your dishwasher will have more info on which programs take how long
dishwashers are only useful if they can use clippy boots can I get a poggers chat
I'm just trying to copy your bot
ive always wondered how the mailman knows wolf link is link
the HyruleanPostalService needs to know where their inhabitants are at, with all the stuff going on
what surprises me more is tha the Mailman is capable of traversing twili like no other being
or maybe she has a tumor
OOOR its just cus small body humanoid characters are harder ish to make proper heads for given babies usually have kinda weird proportions there
I feel really unhinged right now so I'm just being very careful at the moment PrideUnicorn
and no, I'm not high LMAO
although an edible sounds good atm
I see someone has the good pride emotes PrideUwu
I do think I have them all, there were 25 ye?
PrideShrug PrideFloat PridePog PrideCute PrideLaugh PrideUwu PrideRhino PrideLGBTea PrideToucan PrideDragon PrideUnicorn PrideWave PridePenguin PrideFlower PrideLion PrideHeartR PrideHeartL PrideRise PrideStrong PrideLove PrideHeyyy PrideKoala PrideCrown PrideWorld PridePaint
those are all the ones you coulda earned back in like 2020?
PrideShrug PrideFloat PridePog PrideCute PrideLaugh PrideUwu PrideRhino PrideHeyyy PrideLGBTea PrideToucan PrideDragon PrideUnicorn PrideWave PridePenguin PrideFlower PrideLion PrideHeartL PrideHeartR PrideStrong PrideLove PrideKoala PrideWorld PridePaint PrideCrown PrideRise
yea it was 2020 or 2019 or some such
one of the last times an event like that was done to my knowledge
also hyperscape based emotes which I know came after
then hindsight 2020 got a set
which that last one I dont know if it was also distributed in the same way as pride emotes
but nothing like that been happening since around 2020 rly
lots boilin down towards more "watch this NOW to get emote"
and then the weird streamtogether event thing they did last year christmas roundabout which.... yea.... no.....
I legit don't remember that PrideLaugh
@OhHeyItJaye tldr: look at this one and you will understand quickly why there's been goingons about that last one I mentioned: CatintheChat
how cool would it have been if they had a separate four player adventure mode where you play as the telma friends storming hyrule castle
this split is now hell KEKW
so close to sub 6 SoB
I randomly got recommended a video from the VGBootCamp channel so I decided to take a look out of curiosity and most of their vods now don't even crack 500 views
I have never seen an esports org cook themselves harder
that makes sense then why I dont have any clue who or what that is lmao
never was big in watching esports type shit
when i played the horse segment zelda couldn't aim for shit
its all eponas fault in the end
zelda just sits straight angle atop of epona
so you gotta tail dorf flat, otherwise ya get trolled
that zelda split could also still improve if you get quicker dives out of her, ye?
i still don't understand how everyone gets revived
but thats like maybe 2s or somesuch?
I go get a snack for 2 minutes LMAO
I love the way link runs in Zora armor
Not tagging along with buff00n but maybe in July
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Awsm finish out! Great job on the PB! Hope u have a wonderful rest of day/night
if it’s anything like storm, he’s gonna get buffed and be broken
I saw splash make a girl crash out and take drugs in a video game
wtf's Splash doing to women ?
This town ain't big enough for TWO png tubers
to be revealed soon or whenever zach is not asleep to watch the test stream
I tried the DKC Returns Demo
they started me with 74 lives
Raven streams the day they announce Wario Land 4? Crazy
They're adding Suicune to Pokémon Unite
Hd randomizer At 9am let's go chroma149MRFAIRY
Are you in the HD randomizer discord?
So I assume mashing swift sail is faster than regular swift sail
On version 1.1.0 we have many many QoL improvements, for example, quite swift sail
Also it's theoretically possible to get an unbeatable seed when playing with charts due to a bug
Also Also, we have a weekly community race seed if you Wanna join
It's super casual, also it's async so everyone can play at their own time
Got a whole audience with that chest
Just run up a wall like a goat you do you link
So how does supersonic grapple hook go zoom mode work
Don't worry I don't math either
why are people saying Mai looks like a man in SF6, what do I have to do to look like her
I think I need to kill Andy Bogard
@Phantom5800 I've been saying for years now that Geese Howard looks like a woman
Molgera what do you think of this matter
your triforce piece is in botw? good luck
I see you're playing wind waker btw, you should try the wind waker rando
botw and totk in archipelago with koroks on
Randomizer but one of the items is in a completely different game
And tell him to give us Luka back please we haven't won a game in 3 weeks
these great fairies suck, they have 4 arms and no tits
at least the TP great fairies bottle their tears for you
What's stopping me from growing wings and flying for 12 seconds
person that raided morph said they died in City in their TPHD run so I went to look. They didn't clawshot high enough and Argorok hit them with fire
they just didn't get high enough on the pillar and needed 3 clawshots before peahat could be targeted
I don't know what emote to use
That's something pallos would say to me
maybe if you had an ess adapter like sd
botw and totk actually ban having notches on your controller
he's playing ttyd and is about to talk to flurrie
the great tree's hole is block and flurrie needs to blow it open
pope just pressed the everything button for the new people
beest's wooden statue split icon has TOS plastered over the tip
i have been so hyper fixated on super mario sluggers bc matt is a part of a draft league with his friends where the cpus control everything
matt and I watched a game that went into the 12th inning and ended in a tie
the actual league games are played tn so we'll see if the same thing happens for real though
tbh one of the teams that was a part of that game is currently 0-3 so they probably want a big blowout to have a chance
you can't do that puzzle with grapple or bow right?
we're milking hylians in this stream?
matt got me with the if you read this you're gay last night and i just saw it now
this feels so wrong without the toad mod
@Phantom5800 i'm gonna pretend like i never saw that
yo plant ty for the gl
yo morp ty for the gl
the devs deserve some bouncing on it for that tbh
okay im finished eating now, my shitposting powers are unleashed again
i love that ice arrows are actually good in this game
forbidden tingle statue is a crazy name
what's wrong with a sticky tingle statue
the thought of someone beating it off to tingle is terrifying
finally immortalized and it only took talking about a sticky tingle statue
I don't even remember saying that
i love the atmosphere of this fight but otherwise it sucks
this one cycle looks so hard
Are you on 1.1 yet rickyLUL
it's just crasher wake at that point
i don't want to move either
TIL light arrows can stun you too
i won't say hi to the other site
6 more days for daybreak 2 HYPERCLAP
YEP everything getting drop for that game
what if you had to find the boat
grandma just gives you a boat
Now this is a Glitchless Any% closing in on sub 6 The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess stream I can get behind phanto274Smile
Remember when this song was our ... 😳
the paper that leads to the cheese rock
todays not your day for goats
damn they have really big foreheads
phantom im at 43k out of 50k  so soooonnnn
soooon u get a dumb minish rando seed
If you happen to fall off the platform there you use midna from the ground to jump onto the water wheel into the house
aww carnt annoy monado today then
@Archimedesbones Oh great, bean man is here
@Monado p4 righht now no balls
What if Zelda... was a girl?!
What if Zelda... stopped putting bad items into games, like the top in this one, or the telescope in Wind Waker?
idk what you code in, but for the past 2 years ive been using go and i just discovered vlang and every page of documentation I read I'm mindblown
thats fair. my brain isn't big enough for c/c++
Your brain is bigger than mine. I can’t even make a livesplit properly KEKW
so sub 6 is definitely possible
Yeah lol I still dont fully understand it but they are separated now
Wait you do? I didn’t know that lol
Monkey is just a scaredy cat
Gotta call spider man for that spider
Didn't know you could jump from there with the spider walking
you need a monkey clap sound effect redeem wheres hes just upside down
Quick spins are good again so far
you can multitarget above the door to make the door rise
i think most things in this game you can only target once. but the door is an exception afaik
I guess the boss you can too
Link is throwing for content :(
i did it on wii u but idk if its on gc
i was trying to time that appropriately lol
How runs going ? Gl for runs
Nice to see another Zelda game besides OoT and MM
Are people not playing LttP anymore?
have you ever tried the uh. what was it. the fangame that turns LttP into a procedural roguelike
i still want to beat four swords on gamecube
I still wanna try out the oracle games
My dishwasher didn’t clean my dishes NOPERS
@AnniLyn2 love both the oracle games
Gonna have to hire phantom to wash my dishes now
does your dishwasher have a 'Tough" option
@midnaliin check for mold first lolz
no way 70 cents usd a hour
is there a holiday bonus for extra plates beyond the average
yeah burned pots is going to be an upcharge
No but I’ll feed you pop tarts NODDERS
I got 99 questions but they make no sense
Chocolate cuz the strawberry ones are gross lol
Just z target over and over until the bug comes to you
"No fire. Caution" proceeds to have fire in there already
Not an opinion just a fact KEKW
what was there was really good but i was left at the end kind of like "that was it?"
So imagine. Epona didn't show up... how the fuck do I go back to ordon with the gate there
Barnes don't got bombs yet and they don't have keys
Probably...throw him over the gate xD
Well no gorons had to help because of his bomb lab exploding
Not gonna say who blew it up but..
he intentionally stepped out of the ring
Not bad enough to start all over
if he restarts he can test the multi target dungeon door though
gl on run at movies 🎥
@AnniLyn2 in the room after you get the boomerang? on wii u you can multi target it to open the door all the way instead of opening it a little at a time
I've tried that before... it never worked :/
which bokoblin has the damn flute?? he's dying first
But...only half?? How did you die
jump off the watchtower and die
No no keep doing glitched...practice makes perfect
is the decision to make something a glitch determined solely on occurrence frequency
Put the rock to the right of the pink flower trust
like just right of it or on it
Eh this is the more important category anyway.
No it's fine...I've been exhausted all day today
yo congrats on the sub 6!
I saw you in eldin twilight as human... what were you doing...
Gonna dip out here but good luck on JOTWAD NODDERS
you can start it you just can't finish it :P
i'm doing a game for the RA Challenge League right now and my god it's been like 10 minutes of talking with no way to skip dialogue cause it's all voice acted lol
for a sega saturn game it's not BAD voice acting. there's just so much exposition at the start lol
nah i said it wasn't bad lol
all i know is that trick isn't possible on wii u because of an invisible wall
my headcannon is that EMS was patched because it could happen accidentally to a casual player
otherwise they would have also fixed boomerang lja
I think a random player could technically get on the ledge by mistake
I mean a lot of big glitches are discovered on accident tbh
You think drinking piss would give a minimal amount of vitamins in there somewhere?
and if a casual player just happened to land in the sacred grove area they would ruin their save file if they got master sword
i got isg as a kid by mistake in mm
though that's unlikely. I think it's just possible for a casual to land on the ledge
@SwiftPichu_ only if you took extra vitamins and your liver was trying to filter them out
i haven't modified an emote in a hot minute
i don't think that's light arrows):
Almost everything used for clips is just rough
joey says the dumbest shit istg
The one sorta debatable is idk, rupee roll I guess?
close to 1 mil points so cant redeem anything
I mean you focused on ad so makes sense
who would want to play a seed where they turned of tresure charts except for lights arrows
Any other categories you want to learn other than glitchless?
I talked to this at glubs but yeah I do think ww and tp any% are probably the hardest ones
tp is a very punishing game
the early game is so obnoxious
it would be funny if you started with the grapple hook and all of the other items were in the tresure charts
And in the end game you're praying for good zelda
prime 2 is equally as obnoxious but for the whole run
prime 1 it kind of depends on what route you do
fastest route, yeah it's obnoxious the hwole time
I prefer elh to this so I'm not looking forward to doing this trick again when I learn ad
Is spr still one hit and you're dead?
I think you need to tap iron boots on and off a bit faster
but I have done a fair amount of pillar clip in the past
I want 2:57 or 2:56 first
ad I don't think can do elh without it complicating things
just because you need to beat forest temple
and also you need bombs to do it
I would say do wolfos jump but no midna on the back
what save it really needs is pot boost
hey phantom you should try the randomizer for this game
My seed today was abhorrent lmao
It made me last check every possible thing
Maybe I locked on too far up then..
Speaking of ik TP AP exists now altho it's like super duper early
That's the only way to let out anger...swinging a sword side to side lolz
Okay so question on  this one...is it considered glitched?
Had to make sure I'm sorry xD
How do you get that btw? Practice like certain parts over and over?
How do you access the practice tools on it?
No but I definitely wanna learn the poe skip
it was there at the very bottom
Not in eldin but can I see how you do the miniboss key skip?
Jesus christ I remember that xD
I'm still in awe of that
Still how do you get past the boss door lolz
Armogohma just give me the shard...we won't kill you
I'm gonna jork it to morpheel
Reminds me of an old animé I loved
I have my right to remain silent
Otherwise it's racism because I'm Mexican
Please do not rob me of this
Your backflip is in your epilogue on the sub 3:35
as someone who has failed at doing that a lot I can say it's hard.
Morpheel is just as bad as morpha
Wow. Already at Morpheel and still only 0 seconds into the run
D: but you have such a good time ATM
Well, hopefully next time goes better
Super tempted to learn it despite the challenge at this point
I had the dream of all time last night.
That wasn't very goated of them
That goat went "Nah fuck your speedrun"
They do randomly decide to just not go in sometimes I noticed
That goat was just sitting there waiting for you just to screw you over
Made it for ordon village LETSGORON
Didn’t grab the brown chicken NOPERS
Okay I’m redownloading yugioh… wish me luck KEKW
I actually have 550 hours in it. I have a problem I think lol
I’m so bad at the class trials in dangaronpa lol
I keep losing to the bullet time battle cuz they use nega time
I was hoping you would know KEKW I need to turn the difficulty down I think
It’s a collection I have the first and second one
but the third I’ll have to buy when I finish them
I tried to watch the anime for the first one but it was very repetitive I didn’t like it KEKW the game is much better
the fact it was based on the game makes it much better
ohh there’s no third game? lol
Don't forget about the weird danganronpa 3 anime watch order
being a teenager playing through those games is a crazy experience
@SeventyFourTG that's a nice way to put it
also yeah danganronpa 3 anime is ass
I would always see danganronpa 3 stuff at hot topic because I guess that particular anime is easier to license than the games
"Link are you fucking stupid" is such an early game Midna quote tbh
romani had to get abducted though
Pickles make me want to no longer exist
"you can fry most things" "okay i believe you"
i can't because i'm not midna, but she might be able to
...i just made a really stupid mistake
i got up to get water, instead made garlic aioli and prepped breadcrumbs and egg whites for pork chops, came back, sat down, water's still empty
Should I say... HAY everyone lolz
okay now i have water, didn't lose the run to kb1 i see
...fuck i'm corrupted by glitches, kb1 is after IB
How many dungeons has twilight ?
my balls went into my sword years ago, that's called puberty
Gotta have balls to make Link's sword glow
Dude I am dozing and going cross eyed but don't wanna set up for sleep yet
Where are you from ? Its 0.00 now for me 😅
i was testing my keyboard sounds
Alright screw it...imma take a quick nap...don't go too far
I didn't wanna miss the bulboln̈k
How exactly does lja with the boomerang work in this game? I don't quite understand when it works and when it doesn't
And I presume I can't jump up platforms with it? Just gaps?
Fucking...pain in boot woke me up
@thebloodlilly i mean you can, theyre called LJA's (long Jump Attacks) with very precise aiming with the boomerang but plain LJA's are banned in glitchless
I was dozing and setting up pillows and compression sock was rubbing on ankle
man i wish i could fall asleep fast. insomnia gang
When are you playing randos again?
Did someone ask this already? I'm sorry
Most zelda randos take too damn long
Tp feels a bit linear for a randomizer imo
Ey, Lanayru field does look good
I’m still doing this class trial. I don’t think my IQ is very good KEKW
I remember hating this minigame in the wii version
Mid you've played runnick, ffs you have the iq
Yes LMAO I keep losing to the manga wrap up thing now
And analog controls is just too slow also
Considering I plan on getting both versions whenever my wii arrives, it kinda does still help
@swiftpichu_ true I redownloaded it as well so hopefully I can make a new deck
Do gotta say, the gc version is expensive as hell nowadays
I'm still going to just play gamecube
I think German is still fastest
But Phantom, on wii you get both Midna AND Navi. That is double the companion character!
Jp saves 2 seconds over English
German was 6 or 7. Just bomb bag text
imagine not playing on a Korean wii
Korean is just hard to get and you need to mod your wii in a certain way
I mean the wii can also run the gc version can't it?
Are you for real brother I didn't even fucking curse
@midnaliin add me for free branded deck
Not wanting to interact with the wii menu is pretty valid
I haaated the stamps in hd
Like I'd go open a chest and it'd be a stamp for a feature that got shut down and it makes me all sad and lamenting an old era
The wolf Link amiibo is cool though
I finally passed the trial. I was expecting an F but I got a B KEKW
Don't the trials usually last like an hour or so? Was I just slow
It was a really long trial but I game overed about 15 times
Yeah 2 hours seems like an average time if you make mistakes
I can just imagine Link hearing the kid talk and being like "Fuck off kid". Truly the hero we need
its a reference to how fish hate both fire and ice
and some don't have issues with fire water
Frozen fish sure don't. In fact, those don't react to ice water at all
Dun dun dun, dun dun dun-dun (He's a phantom) dun-dun dun dun dun-dun (streamer phantom phantom phamtom). Runner Phantom was just starting a run when his Nintendo built a very strange machine, it was design to view a world or RNG (He's gonna 100% it all cause he's runner phantom) When it was too slow they just quit but then Phantom took a look inside of it. There was a great big gold, and everything had changed, His SOB got all re-arranged
Read it, I worked hard on it Madge
It wasn't easy to keep the correct rhythm to the theme song
maybe throw on the 4th flash instead of the 5th?
fair, i was just happening to look and saw you go on the 5th flash
...i had to get used to flashes on waterbombs before we did stallord skip with metronomes iceblueThisIsFine
the pattern is stupid too, it's 3 slow then 3 fast
Well then I'm not gonna finish the song SirMad
terry doesn't fuck with me often, he's scared of me
I didn’t even realize you could use bomb arrows for that lol!
Wow, what a neat item. I'd love it we could get it again
Maybe AD but I can’t remember the route if you do GM or lakebed first
I’m not too sure about hundo
Imagine being a bombfish. Being cursed with having a bomb in your mouth since birth
"Well Johnny how was the fishing trip?"  "Fish exploded again. Took the line right with it"
If you run to the left of that guy he will never hit you lol
Personally more of a fan of beyblading up to a giant skeleton monster
That skeleton monster use to be... something
darn of all temples I missed it was lakebed
RIP to that one guy on the twitch front page illegally restreaming the super bowl
Succeful stallord and ruins probably good 20 secs
Talking to him, like he's actually a dog
I mean he gets all the ladies
Ok. I created an audio version of the phantom theme parody
But I can't put in chat. Best I can do is a speech to text
Look I had to write the whole parody first okay
I keep locking my phone out of habit
So I wonder... did link really have to pull the sword out? I mean it was just to get the thing out of him
I mean he could've just got the shadow thing out and just left
Sure. But he KNOWS he's looking to go to the Twilight with Midna
So why would he not bring the one thing that can keep him human for that?
It's really more of a "They didn't know the crystal would stay intact so he can keep transforming"
You got sent to ad city?
mcdonalds wants me to buy a combo meal live on twitch
I have to compete with Glubbers NODDERS
"Hi I'm Michael Jordan" hi Michael Jordan! "McDonald's and I want to-" why did it have to be mcdonalds...
glubbers is gonna gift me a sub in 3
Yeah... remember he only follows the strongest side
Sub 6 lookin tasty and closer fatpidEyes
i have returned with my favorite resturant food
Late game clutch right now GLODDERS
Oh yeah may your owls be superb
I have two options for solutions m
Third option: make someone else pay for your sushi
Option 2 meets both of your requirements
Option 4: Learn farmin, fishing and how to prepare sushi professionally and never have to pay for it ever again
@thebloodlilly with today's sponsor skill share
Option 4 pays with the rarest ingredient tho: time
Don't forget the other rare ingredient... energy
Just start doing glitches to save time. since you lost time it’s fair Clueless
for those bugs i just ride up the sand with the spinner
Skirt go skinny come on phantom u kno this
If one thing is dead for sure, it's the enemies here
Your movement is lookin a lot smoother these last few runs
Link is really not collaborating with you today, huh?
Dude I wish I could be this good though
i spent a good five minutes wacking his head before realizing there was a spin in the middle
ashei is like the wednesday of zelda
@Midnaliin But Midna's been here since the staaart
Midna isn’t best girl until squidna
can't believe zelda did the zora dirty twice. the hot one is dead in this game and in botw
Zelda doesn't want us to have hot fish women
its so his wife can sled on him
yeto become sled just for wife
Hell yeah ice fishing everyday as well
no because there are bottomless pits
Yeah I went a couple weekends ago with the fam
the ice is like 20 inches right now or something crazy
Bumping his head against every wall in sight does not help with his brain function
It’s pumpkin spice season Yeto LETSGO
I always love how yeto just knocks you over to get the food
I think it misheard you. It threw the Link instead
make sure you correct the equips because they put claw on Y
oh yeah make sure the banner remains there
i forgot to mention i have a twilight princess wallet that i like had forever even though i never played it
i mean ive played it by now
file select is the same thing as brightness
you could also do wolfos super jump
you know, I wonder if japanese is optimal for this category
from what I hear people say it's more consistent on hd
yeah he's been practicing that trick a lot
he wants to use japanese for no s+q
it's faster specifically because map glitch doesn't work. it let's you use ooccoo to get map warping and also stay at the gorge
if you did that on NTSC or PAL that would give you map glitch and wouldn't let you enter kak
apparently my wallet is from 2013
yeah you have like 10 extra
here for the chill background stream
you don't HAVE to do that but it's faster
it skips a text box if you say no
in that dungeon i half expected the other suits of armor to come alive but they never did
it least it is not 100% snow peak
damn it seems none of the runs want to be nice today
Okay no yugioh is actually messed up right now. everyone keeps surrendering and won’t play with me KEKW
I like that they let you start with like. Everything else
I think it’s cuz I put my name as “ban branded” lol
I don’t understand someone else surrendered now LMAO
even if you pause to unequip it
you shouldn't need to unequip it in this though
dont you swim at the dash swim speed or whatever
even if you dont swim underwater i mean
for the record i just want to say big poes are ugly
omg wait. its that animal crossing runner
now i need to find a new place to burrow into
im just also a zelda runner too toma
how am i supposed to be like queen emeraldas and use isolation as my coping mechanism
i did tp like twice too pog
well i guess i did a bunch of ILs too
but yeah that pb today was really hype Gladge
the real speedrun is finishing the lettuce before it goes bad
i live alone so the lettuce always wins
I just gave up buying lettuce cuz I know damn well it will spoil in my fridge Sadge
do you know if PROPE worked on the fishing in this game
I know a few people from sega worked on this game but I'm wondering if they were part of prope because prope was responsible for a large amount of fishing games like fishing resort and ultimate angler for streetpass mii plaza
No hit A slow three times KEKW
D: Glitchless doesn't suck. There's no vacuum
Don’t forget to grab the dommy mommy
They've been misbehaving, standing over there instead of over here
isn't midna the dom in this game. she can float anywhere but she decided to sit her fat ass on link the whole game
link would probably run faster without her sitting the whole time
@TomaThePolliwog Both her and Link are switches, hence why she's in Link's shadown when he is human form
I haven't done this trick enough to know what went wrong
the nintendo ninjas patched your disk while you were sleeping
I think the visual cue is different based on where you stand
But idk the trick so I'm just spewing nonsense
my best guess is that the angle buffer was 1f late or early. not really sure
that is true. I just think the visual may be different depending on where you stand
yeah you can figure it out with gz
until you don't remember how to do sacred grove 2 and get lost
in my run i thought my health was good after city so I didn't grab the hc
turns out I only had 2.5 hearts so I had to transform to wolf after getting up
Sorry for the arrogance, I just feel like i'm talking to condescending people, who talk about skill, who think I'm just a high-level rager when they don't even know speedrunning guidelines.
it's in the minish cap discord
It's for more competitiveness, accessibility. But how can you say that, there are red lines that must not be crossed and accepting competitiveness with inequality is simply not serious at all.
Playing the game at a different speed has an effect on how you're playing - for example, playing a game in slow-motion and adjusting the time for it would be considered cheating. The fact that the Nintendo Switch doesn't play games at the same speed also means it's not emulating the Game Boy Advance in an accurate enough manner, which is another strike against speedrunning guidelines.
the TPR tournament literally just finished, I got pinged for getting 7th
exo said the job he interviewed changed the title to COO
his corporate account made like $3k in january, but he only gets half so he's sad
he's been streaming for literally 3 weeks
he applied for partner last week and was instantly denied because he's only been streaming 3 weeks
yo raven ty for the gl
yo phantom ty for the gl
exo was given like $5k in merch by one of his friends, for free, and told he can sell it all to pay bills
better to have gone early than never at all
Can I have a pizza bot
isn't that like the about the time that you would get to that fight in all dungeons?
there is a kitty on my lap now
Cat what are your thoughts Wind Waker
she isn't really paying attention to wind waker so i don't think has an opinion on it unfort
Oh you don't have that emote
Why does the seas of stars ost slap so hard? DangerDance
only acceptable form of transportation in this stream
i just see jr that could mean anything to me
just not allowed to redeem 1st anymore
Anyway, back to phanto274Lurk with me
i'm the red yoshi in RifeWife
i might be at a very low point mentally
Yoo Axl. how'd the rest of your seed go?
there is a logic trick it wants me to do and im very bad at it
what does a MS stand for all master sword?
our mirror charge those things you get when you defeat a boss
Molgera what are your thoughts on the super bowl
i think molgera is an eagles fan and the moldorms are chiefs fans
what do you mean streamer you have a shield right ther /pos
I am in pain...like every other day
2 more weeks til they tell me I can put weight on it
Probably targeted the boar and also zipped into the fire
Recommended insurance, offered a 3D baking pen, and told about making college easier
Only interested in one of those and I barely bake anymore xD
@kaitzumyth how was your ad city?
i need it to be Friday like now
one was about driving a car. I tabbed out after that
the best item in the game Fweet
Go to the general next time lolz
oh yeah right theres a discord
You have your hair out...gonna get hot
had a big ass spider run around the house today. i think its gohma in disguise
no it wasn't a baby lmao
But baby gohmas are huge compared to regular spiders
it even had freaking gaze detection like metal gear. when i looked at it, it ran away
i was like how the hell
Are you in like Texas or something lolz
I knew I should've gone with nevada
Midna, no I don't want to take the purple tic tac
I miss Florida weather and the beach
But then it snowed so now I'm skeptical
last time i heard our beach had flesh eating bacteria but I haven't been in years
its only snowed twice where i am in the past 25 years
You guys might have it on auto
I heard if you shade your AC unit outside sometimes it can cool easier / reduces your bill
Congrats on your spiritual journey fucker
Always wondered why yeto is just standing there
It's the dogs man...always throw me off
The sound the dogs make when they growl...I can't hear anything
I thought I was supposed to wait for the sound to get off the ladder and then reclimb?
When I first played this and saw the chest like that I thought "another ingredient?"
oh yeah i did the three month i forgot lmao
i set that up like, a week ago
bcuz it was like "of youre sub is gonna expire in x days" and i was like, eh, why not
i had to cull alot of my subs bcuz i realize alot of them were spur of the moment things and im like.. i aint got that kinda money soz
Surprised that letter isn't dripping too
like im sorry i cannot sub to ALL of my friends expecially if i don't actually WATCH all of them
NOOOO only need 1 more pokemon to complete genetic apex
i been trading my alt account and it doesn't have the last card i need Madge
tbh my biggest struggle atm is that like, all of my twitch subs come out in the same week LMAO like i did not space them out at all
you cant trade full art ex
I feel like I always sub to people and then while my sub is active they don't stream and I'm like dang it
now that i have a job i will be able to have subs again :)
today was my first day. i mean ive worked in a salon before so i know i like it but the enviornment is nice
and i get all my services free
oh i got the mew guess you don't need all cards
i had uh *checks notes* 12
oh gosh ive never subbed with anything above a tier 1, if im giving someone that much money im going straight for the kofi/donate link
like not to be ungrateful but i had someone gift me 12 subs the other day and theyre like "man i spent 60$on that"
i t3 monado when i first started on twitch
streamer I knocked where's my collab kazamsCatglub
and i tried so hard not to say like "please donate large amounts to me directly instead i only get half of that" lmao
A week of doing rando and my 1st one where I forgot how to do boomerangless forbidden woods basement was my fastest LOL
like ill gift a sub to either :join a hype train, or Give a cool viewer add free viewing
Hulu should give you mass amounts of money again tbh
if i just  wanna throw money at the streamer id do bits or donate directly
why did link just not hit them
but yeah i set up a !donate command to periodically just kinda throw out there as a warning
can we get a fact check
i prefer kofi over the paypal bcuz paypal.me shows me real name phanto274Facepalm
phantom games bot knows something we don't monkaW
isnt that the onbe that just c came out and is currently on sale? or was at least
ive never played a paper mario game so i cannot have a worthy opinion on it
but the origami one looked neat
there is the switch one for $60
i dont think there is a way for one to see viewers channel points amount
yeah that would have been neat. not to mention if the switch one fixed the localization instead of fixing one thing and censoring others
its like theres no perfect version
and why doesn't the OG sounds badge actually revert the sound effects also??
the lucky sound from ttyd is one of my phone notifications
they totally changed all the dialogue where the goombas hit on goombella in the sewer which was perfect to the japanese translation in the original
oh duh! just read live splits
whats the next game release on your list?
bestbuy preorder has a metal poster
do you think they will add the boob slider back
my next game release is on Friday widehypeE
i just walked in, what does the us release of TMS have to do with anything
"Gee, I can't wait to have 2 physical copies of Xenoblade Chronicles X!" -Some guy probably
I know the b o o b slider was the big thing
I mean switch loading for something like super mario 3d world was slightly slower, so if xenoblade chronicles X does end up being faster I will be surprised
@TomaThePolliwog You didn't have to wait for auto saves to finish though
i swear there was one case where it wasn't
maybe I'm thinking of new super mario bros U
I'll just say the Xenoblade X on Wii U didn't really seem like the most optimized thing with having to download asset packs to make the game load faster
I wonder if the asset packs were a situation where they originally used compression but it took longer to decompress the data from disk than just reading it uncompressed
@TomaThePolliwog Wii U was a slow system in every regard so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the cade
didn't nintendo update the switch to have more input delay for wired controllers?
i actually hate the ps5 controllers. they give me arthritis really bad
something about the face buttons is too hard to press
i forget which game its for but i know switch games also load significantly faster if you use airplane mode
at least it's early and not late
I believe that is just high enough to not be able to roll
people generally aim for the stairs
Suffered really my first theft. My Ebike was stolen today when i was grocery shopping
Are you submitting anything to mwsf
or is it just not showing on the list 4 me
Oh damn right I forgot buff00n just didn't communicate shit to you I should've LOL
We were gonna plan to do that all again if you were in but I guess I shouldve done that myself
You got 5 hours left so if you wanted to last minute you probably could
Could always just submit this and a random pape thing that wouldnt need to be heavily derusted
Yea it would be nice if you were there to see you but if not it saves me money on hotel I suppose
I'll very likely be going to gdq so at the very least I'll see you there
I haven't been to one since agdq 2019
and that was because it was in my state
Minneapolis is a nice place to dick around
I was considering agdq this year too but none of my friends were going
I could have driven there. oh well
they should move a gdq to pnw
I want a reason to go there and no fg events are up there lmao
I will drive if it's 7 hours or less to get there
i want to learn it at some point
The wording could be better there kazamsCatglub
no you cant go to youtube bot
for the quick B&C fight? it's up-up
get jumpstrike and just moon boots jump strike over the gate
the collision is colliding too well
man that bike was the final christmas present from my dad how could today after the superbowl be the faith in humanity lost moment. avarie1Cry laserg8SCREAM phanto274Cry ghunzoSad urooglOopsAD
i think someone stole food out of my moms car the other day
things are just bad i guess
that was a really good run too
environat one of my fave streamers got mugged on a japan trip 30 mins in a coma for bystanders to call for hospital and woke up itemless. It could be worse if i waas there the knife or gun could be used on em.
it can help to do the rolls in pairs rather than chaining a bunch
when you chain a bunch you can keep too much speed
I was trying to figure out how to say that
wasn't watching closely but I can probably help debug if you open gz after this
I think it's a good idea to slash the pot right as you climb in case walking into the pot affects the angle adjustment
idk whether it can really make a difference, but it doesn't cost time to slash it
this is not the right angle
I think the angle ends in 33 or something
just try to be in the same spot every time. the frame can be confusing based on where youstand
We shall lock this down and Victory run!
i feel like zsr needs some updated videos
that hyrule castle barrier one (inside) is uh
it is yoloable but does matter
it's approximately 2 colors and 2 pixles
it's somewhat lenient but the important part is the wall pushes you a lilttle bit into the statue
what happens is push colliders are disabled for 1 frame after transforming
i think there's an early city save iirc i could be wrong
I kinda just walk until the first time both of link's feet are on it
that was nearly as far right as you can get it to work
I like to have a sharper angle when I do it though
oh god hopefully i don't fail it let me check before I get called out
Chatting the strat is to fail it 3 times and curse a lot and then get it
I did not fail it let's go
but I think I did not fail it in the leaderboard run either but I did in fact mess up the shadow beasts for a long time
this is probably a question for the discord tbh
but is using the "launch disc" option in prriloader allowed
I wonder if there's a strat to consistently avoid it
for me it seems 50/50 if he hits you or not
I think people bomb boost over ice boost
it's the bomb boost, not ice boost
I have heard bad things about ice boost
don't think I've ever heard anyone say anything positive about it
I think you bomb boost, go around the room and do some LJAs to skip the freezard
ice boost is quite position and angle precise and so has a lengthy setup, then ends in a frame perfect LJA
bomb boost is a 3f window to start holding up, EZ
and is easily buffered if you wanted to do that
glitchless used to do that bomb boost before lfc
I sure hope the no s&q route doesn't beat blizzeta
(i had someone speaking in my ear didn't quite catch it
it did the bomb boost then did the cannon ball shenanigans
anyone who likes no s&q likes it because of nostalgia
I remember in 2014 when I wanted to learn this game I "started" with no s+q
I haven't done Forest Temple no s&q either
I got to boko pushing and gave up
no save and quit means you have to walk all the way out the dungeons and thats lame
you have not done glitchless low%.
actually the backtracking in dungeons is the cool part of no s&q
the less cool part is having one try at rupee roll before you have to go beat diababa
you could always mash jumpslashes over the fence for a minute or however long it is
@Draconif hmmm what does this skip
I think just 2 portals and the heart containers
I really didn't think at all
you get to run to hidden village from west castle town field
takes like 5 minutes or so
if messenger skip is allowed with keese LJA you could also skip that i suppose
but I think it's specifically banned
my room has a door that goes outside, so i do have a bedroom key i guess lmao
monkaS I hope your room is on the first floor then
FeelsOkayMan not falling to your death
technically my room is slightly below ground but lmfao
felis room leads to the catacombs
id lock the door too if that were the case
feli can you add peepoSled pauseBedge
it's like peepo is sledding across yeto's head
if ive never beaten minish cap but i have two of the bird hats for cosplay am i cool enough to be in the club
mm on switch is faster but is bad so no one cares
sounds like the Wii U VC vs Nintendo DS drama
Wild World loads so much faster on Wii U
@Feli_Heli Doesn't it being faster also make the mask salesman skip harder?
thats part of the reason no one plays on switch
when game devs tie game speed to framerate
I think Touhou 6 is like that also
I had an issue where the game was ludicrously fast at 220fps
link go SNIFFA before it was cool
i feel like i remember people saying that pal mm has extra patches as well, but tbh idk because no one talks about pal lol
i would take an ique just to try the chinese version of doubutsu no mori
isnt animal crossing on the ique
the chinese version of DnM actually has items exclusive to it related to the construction theme
i think they were previously undocumented until this year
animal forest is so much better on gamecube though, the pause lag on n64 is awful
you lose like a whole second to pausing
i should get back to DnM all fish now that i have a new crt
i don't have an official 1019 memory card so I don't submit runs
animal crossing speedrunners are sensitive about memory cards
i have the slowest memory card lmfao
yeah i have three of those
you know they allow 3rd party ones now
I have a madcatz from 2010
but I wonder if swiss would be faster saving
wii is faster saving to memory cards
tbh i dont really care about saving times because fish rng will screw you anyway lmfao
I was trying "goldmod" by cuyler which mitigates the fish/bug rng a little and got like 2 1/2 hours on all golden tools
goldmod also locks the town seed
at least in zelda you can just start runs immediately and you don''t have to reset for good layouts
do you think Link gets dizzy despite the fact that the spinner does not spin him
it was slightly too far right
and this one and the one two ago were not angled enough
midna: what do you plan on doing with this link
this man is the only clown that is allowed to exist
i still dont understand why the occcoo had to have like 16 nipples or whatever
apparently today was a big day for me and I didn't even know it
got home and a streamer with like 16k subscribers reached out to me becuase of my work with the cpus in smash ultimate
so now I get to work with them to make custom stuff for em
Well ARE they actually birds? Like have we seen them lay eggs? They could be bird like mammals
cows have four teats, bunnies have 8-10 i think cats have 6
Only the most important questions in the twilight princess speedrunning community
does fan skip not count as a glitch
i think its implied they were a race that like chimera'd themselves
@thebloodlilly even if they do lay eggs, they could still be mammals. Echidna and platypi lay eggs but are mammals
got too use to you doing glitchless
yeah thats why I was doing master sword glitchless runs
So theoretically, they could be egg-laying mammals that are freaks
it definitely makes them interesting, TP is so inteeesting
the way it starts downpouring and it helps u out is really neat
god bro i think i just spent 3 hours debugging an issue that literally required me to just reverse the order of operations. time for me to go see my bunny for emotional support
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I’m going to get Yu-gi-oh cards for Valentine’s Day
start to build that shining sarco deck
Nice end of stream for sure
perfect, was just about to take a nap
apparently, I missed work today. Oops / shite.
I had a banana pudding boba tea
it even had bits of the cookies that only go in banana pudding and nothing else
when i need to have two tabs open
thats where a lot of my time loss in the beginning is
Yo gl Phantom! hope Epona listens better later lol phanto274GL
oh and the bridge thing happens to me a bunch too
yeah the first time i saw how close you could run near them my jaw was on the floor
to get to the other side! LUL
Im very interested in glitches in this game. Dies it work like OoT ?
@shrike890 u dont die like u do in OOT
The thibgs you must do to use the glitches 🤔
@shrike890 OoT uses a n64 controller and TP uses a GC/Wii controller. hope this helps
@shrike890 they patched out of bounds areas (unless u wanna do pegasus horse)
is going OOB a glitch or an exploit CaitThinking
coro cant turn his head fun fact
its actually just bone. he doesnt have any ligaments to articulate rotation
No he just has bad peripheral vision
i didnt realize they gave it back to you without oil
when do we get phantom 100% :P
at least AMS is always waiting there for you
Not having easy ways to save time besides "don't fuck up!" does suck
the game is trolling you atp
That sounds right just based on the amount of runners without having seen GZ
Do you think Bo is short for "Boy this guy is annoying?"
No that's a brutal place to have RNG
When RNG messes you up only one thing you can do ZygardeSmokingWeed
Made it for death mountain LETSGORON
It’s a running theme now KEKW
I bought cigarettes for one of the seniors today and the poor lady at the cash looked so concerned for me she thought I was buying it LUL
She was like assessing my ID hoping it was fake
Should have thrown in something else as a power move just to flex your adult buying power
@tomathepolliwog I couldn’t cuz I was using their money lol
can you give the tldr on this speedrun category for me
for the record i was here when you were targeting that bug where links wolf ass kept getting shoved in my face and it took me that long to recover
so we have a premade save for this category?
What is that game over audio from? it sounds so familiar but I can’t place it
i forgot i need to pick up a saturn
puyo puyo sun is on the saturn
I would help you but I still suck at PC apparently KEKW
i wasnt paying attention and when i looked back at stream i was very confused how you had made it to snowpeak so fast
Was just gonna say yea BiTE does not loose too much. That also would mean not having to do Gorge Void
but I feel the PC, last run loosing 5 minutes to it SadgeCry
I only got a back up if you are 1 frame early but besides that it is just annoying
@spicy_juice04 you need to show me the backup cuz I’m always 1 frame early lol
I tried to do the backup improvised but it wasn’t working out KEKW
@Midnaliin well you have very limited air after so it is very hard after if you miss tap swimming
I want to say I will have enough air but god knows I just make it in every time
with like a frame of air
Did you watch the rockos quest GDQ video last night phantom PauseChamp
I'm rubbing off on phantom too much
I would if I didnt have to play sd lmao
I'd be willing to do it for the one time but I will bitch a lot about moving in sd LOL
I lose my menuing my aiming and my movement speed
I thought the channel was pretty new for it
Get them to update terraria archipelago and then we're golden
It's been almost 2 years since archipelago worked for current patch terraria lol
Get morph to do oot or something with you
He's done a couple of those
Oh I guess it'd make sense if that's on there I'm just looking at official on the site lol
I would prefer MM but I know they're still working on it
I'm decent enough at WW tho it doesn't matter too much
Since I'm in there every night
If you make a day of it I would be willing to do WW still I just need to be a week removed from hd lol
I'm also not opposed to learning OOT more
I have learned I am not fond of cheese hunts in SOH
It isn't bad in WW cause it's just 8 and it has a check behind it
When I first learned the run I wondered why that door took forever to open
then realized you’re unlocking it lmao
Perceive all the fucks I give, Midna
Kevin we said to die Madge
is it a new sticker for yeta toes
Hey Phantom? You're cursed you know that?
its a funny idea but I shouldn't suggest it because i would only buy midna stickers
I’m about to join a zoom webinar. taking me back to the college days LUL
I need to take one on computer basics 101 at some point KEKW
it’s about more mindful exercise classes for seniors lol
Arbirters ground was a great temple for it
Everyone knows the best Zelda item is the tingle bottle from wind waker hd
Idk I know it's omega useless outside of it but damn that was a good dungeon
me = back to watch u till i sleep
Exactly! An item that gives you an error messege! Best item in gaming history, present and future
Damn maybe I should replay windwaker hd to see what all the hype about it is :)
I only own the gc version yea
My ass got it 10+ years ago for like $30-40
I do not but I also have emerald
I'm just reaping the benefits of younger me for buying a bunch of retro games
Bro did not vibe with the universe
It's funny to me how tp for te gamecube is like 100 euro at its cheapest, meanwhile I can get the wii version for cheaper than going out to eat
Oh, some more ams today I see?
Lucky me, I know for a fact my next glitchless run will be a pb, because it'll be my first lmao
I am not that kind of artist
You will simply have to find someone else
Okay, I got the reference picture and one and a half month drawing experience. Wanted to draw my dnd character, but eh
Yooo Phantom, good luck! phanto274ColonD phanto274BLANKIES
I believe in the first try dot skip
it was certainly an experience avarie1Laugh
i'm still not fully sure what that person was so upset about tbh
after two days of externship at the vets office I have tomorrow off. I am going to sleep in and no one is going to tell me otherwise. 🤣
originally for oot it was made by someone named glank iirc
I have no idea why wind waker or tp do it
well it's gz for tp so just call it tpgz i guess
it does help to do the rolls in pairs
like 2 rolls at a time basically
5:56:17 monadoSmile (that's the time rn)
i'm back on windows 10 i have a second counter again you can't lie to me
@TheGlubbers i'm on windows 97 :)
I feel like your plushie collection keeps getting bigger lol
weren't you talking about how free dot skip was in my chat the other day
honestly fair, i'm just giving you shit
Just wait until there’s a giant Gardevoir behind Phantom in 2 to 3 weeks
that emote is a lie, it's not the tears of the kingdom master sword
you've been in this run for 20 seconds and lost time already
no i meant the text draw cancel you didn't do
if you have the area banner and want to warp or do an action prompt like a door, pull and close the item wheel and save a second-ish over waiting for the text to go away
no i don't give people shit for that
i just laugh at how i scare people with how aggressively i blind snowboard
Okay webinar over NODDERS how did the first run go Phantom
dammit df's here now i can't spew bs
i also haven't said any bs yet
Everyone in my profession is very bubbly and wholesome so it was good KEKW
We meditated during some of it
im gonna ask my boss if we can meditate during work hours
i'm just judging your spr dw
I can't believe your run died to sugma
@midnaliin new legends anthology, pick the exodia deck, easy wins, also hi KEKW
I almost won against that deck with my witchcrafter deck @swiftpichu_
I’m probably going to stick with witchcrafter and swordsoul for now
Glubbers will teach you the way of PC NODDERS
I think i only ever finished 5 runs
I honestly would have kept going but 5 and a half hours is so exhausting
Have fun in your spiritual journey with yeto
glitchless is probably still my favorite category in this game
glitchless is cool to watch but it seems kinda miserable to play tbh
I didn't think it was too bad. the beginning drags on a little too much
Glitchless is like all Zelda games, just grind movement a fuck ton that you're burned to hell OpieOP
but after master sword it's so good
@SwiftPichu_ i hate practicing movement though SadgeCry
I enjoyed forest temple and mines as well
It's OK nimbus we all hate movement
I do love rolling from ordon spring to eldin twilight
the first 30mins of tmc any% are honestly almost worse than swamp imo KEKW
maybe I just have glitchless blood
Also yeah mid, trickstar, witches and most likely a zombie deck can beat it
I don't like glitchless in the prime games though
it's just no oob with more restrictions
I also like paper mario glitchless
and glitchless in primes are just... so hard to define because the movement mechanics in the games are pretty busted
I knowww you and everyone else hates running Pape glitchless :(
omg if it gets accepted I will die
that would be the most hype thing ever
NOTED i did in fact never notice
quit staring at my with them big ol eyes
no way it's as good as the snake eater ladder
@Draconif sure but can i do 1 glitch?
I will not allow you to get master sword and escape the forest
glitchless jotwad is probably like 1:05 or something
Relay multigame comin Yes! pls do it!
this came up at GDQ actually, the 3D zelda jotwad challenge
there was a time where I wanted to do a 3d zelda glitchless challenge
but then botw came out and I didn't want to do it anymore
Gotta love the REAL speedrun categories
skyward sword would have been really fun to learn but wind waker was just ugh
I personally like mweep% in oot
I do not like how wind waker controls that much
tp has spoiled me with curved rolls
I think majora's mask has the best glitchless run out of all the 3d zeldas
it's a nice length and it has interesting routing and the dungeons are all fun to do
i've heard great things about mm glitchless
i do also like oot glitchless
if i wasn't so nmg pilled, i'd play it more
within the span of an hour I've eaten a tuna sandwich + chips, a cup of yogurt with the works, a breakfast sammich and am about to eat a bowl of rice + sweet n' sour chicken
I don't understand why that happens
it's some seam bullshit or something
so far i've learned why people hate HMS skip on n64
@buff00n that’s based are you sharing with the class (me)
yeah when i tested my hori for laundry pool clip, i couldn't get n64 hms once lmao
i thought the hori angles were for the warp not for laundry pool clip
@Midnaliin I mean, I *do* like cooking
@buff00n okay sweet I’ll be in your walls shortly NODDERS
i also just hate the hori its so small lmao
idk much about the observatory stuff but i think you need good cardinals for laundry pool clip
that controller is a bowser throw machine and sometimes bow spook
eh i'll figure it out soon, i also have 1.2 oot (thanks gortho) so i can't kekw house
it felt way better than trying it on gamecube controller
that route is actively bad when you're trying to go fast
it's always fighting against you lmao
and bowser is just worse overall than spook route
this stun loop looks way funnier than the ones in MM lmfao
im on strike against the postman actually
they should make a run thats like AMS but also you do the mirror shards too and ganon too while youre at it
anyone want to do a quick get to palace of twilight race
@Feli_Heli idk where i was going with this message tbh
I picture him saying it with an american ass accent
today i learned sayonara was a Japanese word
if that happens you just adjust left
I've been sitting for a good 2 minutes trying to think of something so I have come to the conclusion that I'm not funny and no one likes me
Well, I may agree that your not funny, but I wouldn't say I dislike you
@SplashV_ Splash, do you need to step into my office? My doors are open.
00's aren't letters, therefor it is not proper grammar
I am Hella improper, so it's fine
@SplashV_ That's easy, all you have to do is go "how about that pallos am I right?" to get the whole room laughing
dost thou wishith to perish by thine blade argorok-sire?
You know I don't want to talk him 24/7 he's bad for my blood pressure
if you really wanna make people laugh, just say allot of random ass one liners
He's right behind me isn't he
see thats a good one liner
atleast you get to try again on that
the 7tv site is so slow now
also if all else fails and you're not funny, simply just be funny @SplashV_
I think he might just hate you too
whats the point of phase 2 when you get to just shoot him for free
so would TP link also be the hero of time since he goes back in time to save Hyrule from the twilight
if we think about the lore, the original hero of time is the one that first aquired the dominion rod and the one the oocoo here is waiting for
So link from tp showing up would mean he by proxy becomes the hero of time in this timeline
i was doing skyward sword pacifist
and i lost the run because i accidentally slashed a chu
pacifist is trying to beat the game without damaging or killing any enemies
so we can do a credits warp to skip demise and it's basically about doing that credits warp and skipping all the enemies and bosses along the way
You ever take your urn for a walk
is it possible for it to stop on the first one
Let gohma do what he wants you're in his house
...i have one attempt in AMS
just gotta cut 1s now :)
oh just got back nice sick pb! phanto274GG
i think there are very few runners that can yolo AD
i just happen to be one of them
I like your funny words magic man
that is not a normal reason to not be able to yolo it
how was your faron bomb boost
sorry of course my TV glitched out right at the end of the run
sorry sienna that was my microwave
yeah can you turn that damn thing off glubbers
sure i'll turn my microwave off for you sienna, i only microwave with consent
you'd do S&S Skip, EMS, finish forest temple and faron, go do eldin, warp back to faron, get Bo TD, go unlock GM, go back to Bo, get IB, go back to GM, do dungeon
it's functionally similar to how GM RTA used to be
fun fact i've done 1 AFS run too
it was a 1:27 where i didn't know the route and was yoloing a submission for drdq
pirate is a fun stupid cat ext
gay rta is unofficial but exists
i can get the gay rta route doc if you want
i want to learn the glitched version
nice cameo from Link and Epona in the song there :P
In two days I’m going to buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards again
yo, so what's new in the build?
state of play start in 3 mins so brb !lurk
If I have a small amount spare I might buy into Sky Striker due to the promotional shorts they did
Again I’m playing for fun, no sort of meta involved
sky striker seems cheap to build
get used to those chat because she has a sword and irons
wareho5Hellooo gl on the rando run
i finally started getting into this rando but need to find good settings
phanto274GL iceblueGL  the usual for rando runs
Those 4 shop gorons back there should all be available immediately
Each of the different ones is their own single item shop
Pause, click on Options, then press Z
also just noticed we got Witcher Link
the chicken thing became much easier when i realized you could let go of the chicken early. i had been trying to fly just long enough to land on the targets
i did ice puzzle without looking anything up but it took me like an hour
so that probably means im dumb as rocks
I think for the puzzle to work well in a race they would need to change the puzzle solution
Removing the check depends on how the numbers work out, but it is by far the first to die if one does lol
I mean the name is accurate
Generally I can't get over that the music in tp is sooooo good
Each track wonderfully conveys the emotions it's supposed to give off I love it
Anyway gonna head to bed now (it's 11:40 pm) , good luck with the run
>.> phantommm  im now at 46k  gettin closerr
Gate keys is what unlocks that
and like usual gonna have u in background till i pass out
idk why but ur nice and happy soothing to have in backgroudnd
Oh yeah it is just disabled for Weak. That confused me too ngl
Lunar is working on freestanding Rupees. I think currently it is literally only the Kak Village bell
Oh yeah they are everywhere lol
Dig as a different thing would make sense
for some reason twitch wants me to knock on your stream, even though im not streaming
borderlands 4 release date was the best part
@Feli_Heli twitch wants you back click here to take us back pls don't leave us --twitch
i really like the ordon song and the lake hylia song in this game
honestly I feel like if they added some depth to it, link fishing could have been its own game
imagine like fishing with midna that would have been raw
thats my favorite way to do this fight
We know Agatha cleaned him out
So does that mean she's a better sumo wrestler than Lonk is
The rage inducer that is G O A T S
Required G O A T S
It might be due to portal work being done
You can pick some portals as starting items now
HOLD this a all sanity and i miss 50 mins of it Sadge
Hey phantom did you know there's a rando for this game you could try it's pretty cool
Also state of play was boring as expected lol
But the early listing I saw was real there's a new digimon coming
Most of the rest was just the classic pre-rendered cutscene into 2026 lol
where was my re9 trailer Madge
Sony shows are boring I dont think it's worth it over just waiting for headlines
i have loogt up you pm rando for gdq was fun to wathc <3
That statue jump scared me when I first saw it the other day lol
In front of the ToT door. It was not there in 1.2
Hold pot and quick transform while standing in that left corner
phasmid, lil phasmid. I want to tie your antannae into cute bows.
The Sacred Wood Sword that all Legend of Zelda Links start with
The Wood sword that can hurt Ganon too out of all the Wood Swords in Zelda
I honestly never understood why they added bottled water in this game because its just never used
you *can* get stuck but you can also throw one of the tiny statues over to get inside
Bingo 3 poes all worth 5 bucks
Phan didn't find that one funny lolz
"Are there any souls that aren't just a blue rupee"
Cursed by the blue and orange rupee
what is it thief? I mean, vaan
it’s funny how links wrist gets locked in place
excuse me was that poe soul a poe soul?
Would you believe that the best thing gotten from a Poe Soul was just a broken heart container
Agitha is rearing her head at us now
Agitha is really staring at you
lil ant, lil ant. please lift me up and carry me like a princess
it would be awesome if they did a hide and seek rando, where they filled dungeon rooms with bugs and like left one of the bugs as the bug you need so you have to like squint your eyes and shit
Imagine if this dungeon is just full of cash because it's the Poe dungeon
imagine it all being cache and getting a larger wallet instead of a heart container at the end
The prophecy is starting to look correct
lil ghost rat, lil ghost rat. won’t you tug on my hair and make me a chef
One nice thing among all the cash
Okay that was the only redeeming thing among the poes so far
Link isn't a Wolf he's a Husky
rgamer hitting too close to my elementary days
What did you have a Husky in the family?
Lot of videos of them in the internet doing goofy things
I’m not sure what my favorite dog is. maybe a collie.
I've seen a video of Border Collies herding a Husky
I used to watch a lot of lassie
Border Collies are also known for being intelligent energetic dogs
I’m just not a dog owner type person. too much maintenance
I was about to call that
even cats as well these days. I mean I’ve had cats for over 18 years, my patience cleaning litter boxes with asthma is wearing thin
whatever’s in litter goes right through masks too
I feel ya on the upper respiratory problems
I kind of have them myself
right now I have 3 cats and a rabbit
@tomathepolliwog your rabbit has to have trust issues around 3 cats KEKW
she actually wants to fight the cat who is a bully. she got along with my oldest cat when he was alive.
I have to pull her away because she will get her eye taken out by the cat
Omg that’s so cute I need to see her trying to square up lmao
the cat doesn’t know what is happening
idk how you did that in one cycle but that was impressive
3 buggies, hopefully that's enough for Agitha
I’m cooking up the best chicken Alfredo right now phanto274Jam
Yeah I’ll bring it over in 5 NODDERS
you can ship some to me with dry ice right
You actually have to be here to do the dishes MadgeRn
@tomathepolliwog absolutely I’m actually in your walls so I can hand deliver it
the first time i played snowpeak i completely missed this room and its like the cannon tutorial room
No need gale banana and bedroom key in order to hit go and find the right bugs
they should make it so he doesn't have ball and chain if you've found it already, there can only be 1 :P
ball and chain in the ball and chain fight monadoLFS
I made a steak for dinner
Whelp don't need Agitha's sword anymore
uhhh I do have 5 more raw ones
I do like them medium rare so just a fare warning if that’s not your thing
Is that a new to 1.3 thing or is it just you're used to vanilla?
anything past medium well is a crime
I prefer medium but when I go out to a restaurant I always order medium-rare cause generally they always overcook it cause they don't want to be sued unless you go to like a real fancy restaurant.
if I ever get back into the dating scene, I could never order a t-bone because I look like a orc when I eat those
what's wrong with looking like an SMOrc ?
I just noticed right before you said it too lol
how to unlock the REAL light sword in twilight princess
The sword that all the dogs would lick
I prefer lemon-flavored sword personally but yeah
it works better if claw is on X
I was gonna ask worse than ice block puzzle but at least that is consistent
you definitely can LJA to the chest
except that boomerang is looking to be the go mode item
I don't remember having any problems with this chest casually but idk that might just be me blocking out the PTSD or just me having given up after like 2 tries...
Agitha always has the good items
Maybe this time you'll get 50 rupies!
wtf kind of carnival game has spike pits btw?
that feels like a lawsuit waiting to happen
I mean Hyrule is built on top of a void
Can't get more dangerous than that
I should try another one of these but not randomize agitha
last time I had to hunt down a male pillbug to get the stupid lantern
I had returned with amazing news
it also feel like lake hylia cave always has something because it has 1 trillion checks
I'm probably also gonna exclude hyrule because I don't want to go on a scavanger hunt for the boss key or keys
We've created a ninja like Samus on a game dual wielding guns with bigger boobs
Weird lag just happened but okay
well that eliminates half the checks!
I'm gonna make a guess and say goron
what if it's in forest temple lmao
Dangoro is literally a bully NOPERS
So I haven't uh...set up a rando in a while because I preset some before the injury happened
Was there a setting where the shards and shadows could be literally anywhere?
so do you have to complete dungeons or is it just get everything necessary to complete Hyrule Castle?
I deadass was about to ask why you didn't LJA over
I'm too lazy to grab my laptop and go to the website
you can put your glitchless knowledge to use here now to get through the door at least right since you can't LJA?
so how's your day been, Phantom?
I freaked out but didn't realize lolz
Link with the DMC 4 standing on the door as it falls over
Do you have ice traps on?
traps feel like they're just a time waster tbh
Supposed to be faster with the master blaster
so that's why his forehead was glowing orange
@darkness3827 I think the real meaning is that helping people cost time and money
you gonna pick up that $100 bill.
and the sugar is so fine you lose half of it to the air when you scoop it out
clearly you gotta do all the double dom rod checks :P
ok im prepared to challenge these statements lemme look at my box
Im telling you Toma....mostly salt than sugar
for daily value maybe. 7% salt and 8% sugar. but its only 150mg of salt, and 22g of sugar, that's like ~1400x more sugar than salt
Damn...I'm glad I didn't bet on it xD
its basically diabetes. but i get it because the flavor is nostalgic for me
my grandpa used to drink it
22 grams of salt might kill you lmao. Okay prolly not but it'd be very unhealthy lmao.
yeah it would do something alright lmao
1:44 with these settings would be impressive
i always wondered why sometimes they used the bug sounds for the key
and then other times the keys weren't shiny
like did a bunch of playtesters just completely not notice the key drop??
to dip your piss sword into
i only bottle the ripest piss
I think it's an AR code for Gale Boomerang @Phantom5800
Ads make the world go around
dub and you won't see ads.
Why does your sword look like it was dipped in piss
@darkness3827 I would if I had money and a job
Maybe someone will be kind enough to gift you a sub
if you get light sword will it look even more like piss or like a different color?
I kinda doubt it Monado. I've either been gifted one or rain would get it for me
Yeah but now we gotta save money for a part for his car...I think he said it was the exhaust?
I would be forever grateful if someone did Monado
I got beaten to gifting Anni so Monado gets one ig lol
the usual 5 rupees from a poe
You know what to add onto the scam train...
Cheer100 Have bitties from the spare pile
yay we leveled up our scam train to level 2!
@darkness3827 nah midna got me on this one
jolteon is passed the fuck out behind ya glennj5Sleepy
Cheer100 sonic: hey kids donate to my scam train to get scammed lol you dumb babies
Don't you mean 2 dead poes
nah there was that 1%er poe with $100 on him.
that's a value of idk, $20???
The most useful thing the Poes had on them was a small key to snowhead
The sign translated from hexadecimal to ascii says "I hope you have a great day!"
49 20 68 6f 70 65 20 79 6f 75 20 68 61 76 65 20 61 20 676 72 65 61 74 20 64 61 79 21
whoops. i messed up on that one digit should just be 67
thats cheating can yopu go back and do it correctly?
oh shit I got a pill bug too!
what's that like the 6th vanilla poe?
Okay I’ll be over Monday sounds good
I'm getting a Chicken Shawarma on Valentine's day
piss money to go with your piss sword
I can't wait for Ape Escape to do another crossover and never get a new entry
I thought the snowpeak one was the worst chest
I am currently getting hammered by a snow storm
I’m dipping out but good luck on the rest of rando NODDERS
whose idea was it to make those ledges that small they deserve a fine of like 50 rupees at least
Oh there sure is stuff here, never said it was good stuff though
well we know spinner is somewhere.
Damn is that a GPU on your rupee count or are you just happy to see me
need to have enemies do quad damage so health actually matters or something lmao
So can I talk about poop rq? Because there's a scary thing on my mind
did you know bunnies eat their own poop
@seventyfourtg I know that reference lolz
But uh...my niece in law. Whenever she poops it looks like either explosive or the size or a golf ball. She's almost 3
All I could think is "how the hell did that come out of you??"
maybe she has an intolerance to certain foods
im not experienced with toddler poop
I just went to the bathroom and due to pain pills: constipation. Shit (no pun intended) hurt like hell. How does she even handle that
yeah, I almost never take pain pills for that reason
that and my liver is bad, so its not good for me anyway
Hospital gave oxy which helps because of the boot
You can't take like Tylenol or ibuprofen? Also they give her miralax because she won't if she doesn't
Most of the time I do randos...iza is dead
Hey you found the rang! Where was it?
The one place they didn't want to go...had to go to
you can talk to the duck also
idk if he'll give you a hint
too many animals was my scathing review of animal well
somehow you can get turned around and go down the river backwards
Dumb send button. If they're not then animals should include hints
Idr who but someone has been saying that lolz
I love talking to that one chicken who is like. "I think I'm going to get eaten""""
Oh shit I can phanto274Howl now
Toma wasn't there one who was just admiring itself?
Don't remember if it was the chicken or one of the frogs in ordon
I wish that I can fly. Into the sky. So very high. Like a dragonfly
Chest, poe, and flying skulls. My faaavorite
@AnniLyn2 I want a milky way
You're gonna need that Phan what are you talking about lolz
don't worry I was making a reference only I would get
youtube search neil cicierga fly away
What if there are items in the rocks phanto274Smile
I think rocks? are the last thing they have to randomize in OOT/MM rando
yes what a blizzard of a bike ide and in time for endgame
Where were the booties and boomies?
@AnniLyn2 I really count on milky way
Let's eat a milky way...I'm a dragonfly
@seventyfourtg It's oddly fitting and idk why. It just makes sense
Okay so Phan...which is worse? Telma or spring water transport
It's the spinnies man...if I knew this was better I'd be doing it constantly
@AnniLyn2 that's the power of music for you
OK do it again but don't hug the cliff
I mean they can't anymore lolz
I just call them spinnies ever since ocarina
I tried avoiding them with the large quiver
74 now I got the song in my head...
Also Phan phanto274GL with the rest of this seed. I have high hopes for ending
i feel obligated to post that emote when I hear that song LUL
there is a trick im trying to learn for banjo cause its in logic and my last seen required it
how is the seed going RatSmoke
at least you'll be ready for vday with that amount of hearts
hey so that was horrible and I hated that jump
THIS CAVE GIVES ME ANXIETY OK
every time i watch snowpeak i want ice cream
i misheard the first time and thought you were calling this ass Luke and I was like 'he has a name??'
You should beat these randos faster
even closed captions thinks you're saying Luke
why do you have a pee sword
We taking bets on last item being the reward for all poes?
May as well pick it up, you're practically there 😏
Lets go to floor 50 then!
Honestly if I was that camera I would just cooperate
Are we seeing you at SGDQ???
no boss we don't want to see you explode
I have to get hot girl body tea ready first but I'll be there
Laiya said @ her, shes got you
this is a short glitchless run
I move home permanently and then it's go time
Make a pitstop in New Orleans first
Lai and I will drive you around :3
raw gatorade powder kind of tastes like lemonheads
wonder if i could turn this stuff into a hard candy by baking it
You know why you aren't in go mode already? Arbiters isn't required
what's standard WOTH for Hyrule Castle? 3 mirror shards, Sword, Boomerang, Wolf, Spinner, Shield?
i guess if you already know the boomerang pattern you don't need arrows. or maybe you can hit it with clawshot
this seed has it out for you
why does bro look like the joker
Argorok the dragon that takes one less damage
The purple and green is not the worst fit ive ever seen
I failed PC twice but I'm not even mad. I was pretty sleepy trying to run it
I'd be having a joker moment too if I dealt with this seed
Still looking for a spinner and a bedroom key
I want to do bomb boosts and LJAs
I don't want to do epona oob
Big fan of the gold MS
this game has so many jokes
Now that is a middle finger lol
because fuck you, i agree with ice
the real question is why didn't you have it earlier Kappa
yo fuck you glubbers, i mean what's up bud?
yo fuck you ice cmdrglWave hope you're well, i'm alright
about to subject myself to torture i mean learning new speedrun
Phantom: You're right, it was an empty threat :(
@TheGlubbers Im sure, totk? will ne fiiiiine
is there any game to speedrun that isn't torture?
if it were totk i would not be dreading it
Oh, wait I thought you'd done MM before
@Darkness3827 Celeste isn't that bad cause it's next to no RNG
don't you need some dumb bad controller for a specific angle
a hori, yeah i have mine plugged in
who pissed on your sword bro
ah i love looking at ace/srm bullshit
get on the top of the chest, drop the bomb in front of you, jumpslash on 7th red
0807BD23 3886A667 - 87Sはぁヲピセ - j 0x801EF48C i think part of this is a file name
thanks i made it myself (i did not)
what does each digit do exactly, you have 20 seconds
You see the piss sword is because it's something a dog would do
anything but that im a virgin
I thought for a second you were gonna say your mom was a virgin nozo KEKW
that would make me jesus christ
that would still mean my mothers not a virgin
there are some virgin fish that give birth
well mother is a lose term doesnt have to be biological
I have never wanted to go clean more than after watching something so cursed (it's this chat)
thanks I will (takes myself out in the trash)
most zelda streams are some form of cursed
phantom doesn't have to teach me that votes don't matter, thats why marie won the splatoon 1 splatfest
thanks for showing us how the void out works
he tried to be cool, but he never went to school
imagine getting your bomb snatched by a clam
I feel like this is a euphemism of some sort
its a euphemism for your mom
i will die if the hearts pop out and then the spinner
oh gods she does have painted toes
I'd love whoever gave me 100 dollars
an ad played before I could see what it was
I just got blue balled by twitch
and the tiny preview skipped ahead like 5 seconds
twitch is a professional blue baller
I wish someone would love me like yeto loves yeta tbh
I wanna be told "look into eyes of yeto"
sled race is the equivalent of Goron Races
Master Sword, have you been PISSIN' tonite ? ? ?
Lil Sword, lil Sword, you look so sharp I bet you could slice through my sorrow...
I remember when you were just here
And said "fuck that last chest"
i wish i knew how to do this
I hate arachnophobia like just let the spiders get married
would have been funny if there was a dominion statue in the ceiling for the last one that was like a giant shoe
where was spinner? I was trying to take myself out with the trash but the compactor was broken
is AMS decent to get into?
it looks appealing cuz its like an hour long
I like glitchless master sword but im still bad so its like 2 hours 40 mins
allot of the tricks I already know how to do I think
its just the speed running specific ones i'd have to learn
this is still my favorite boss music
I mean you literally did a jump strike that shit hits hard as fuck
im pretty sure 2 jump strikes would kill no?
can always also just do the mortal draw tech with midna
you interrupted her with your sword bruh
hit him with the pee sword
now that I think about it every phase of ganondorf has good music
I just like beast ganons the most
Beast ganon feels like the most honest iterations
the way it interacts with the portals is awesome
so you just look into the sky?
Honestly the laugh into the serious face is so iconic
Just shove your pee inside ganon
you were out of kick range
so link can just kinda turn into a wolf forever now, right
they don't tie that loose end up
(hi G i hope you're well)
But ganon wants you to try inserting your pee
is she streaming tonight? I thought she was off
Midna in true form kinda a baddie tho 😳
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day iceblueRaid
Good luck for your runs today 🤗
There he is 😁😁 lets gooo
is a yolo run any different from a normal all dungeon run
is this just done with more whimsy
Hey I made it to a stream on time  for once
what does this do, skip a cutscene trigger?
"maybe i could pull this out" joey pls
oh my god ofc it was beast
I don't know twilight princress how much of GM does that skip?
the game is 20 years old we cant keep discovering new nonsence like this
skips the maze, and one of the  elders, and the - yeah
So incredible in vanilla, Eh in rando since rando has fast iron boots
I'll probably just order the cards that I want
like i came here hungover minding my business and i learn new tp skip drops
this game is twenty years old this is ridiculous
one day i will have patience to learn how to do some runs for tp, but also, i dont want to
I'm also waiting for the quarter century stampede to come out to buy a few packs for the LUL
guess I joined at the perfect time to bring bad luck lol
You know a speedrun is fun to learn when a fucking rock can kill a run
gonna lurk for a bit in chat
Goats behaving for a change? We might actually have a shot at WR
ya know this also now fuckes with tp gltiched logic for rando
as aparently it can be done without ib
making no ib goron mines that much more doable
you can gate clip with wolf through that door, aparently
so yeah, still dont need IB for gm in rando i guess rip
iuts what theyre talking abt rn lmao
I didnt get what you are doing 😅
No audio cuz Im visiting fam but good luck NODDERS
I gotta get those reward points phanto274Mash
Is it just visual that you are carrying a shield and sword ?
it took me ten tries yesterday to get the kak watchtower alcove chest which is a trick i havent truggled with for motnhs,  its an off week clearly
Even the inventory is like at the beginning
I know nothing about this game so far 😅
that was robbed from you fr
Just helped a friend of mine with some dungeon quests many years ago
you know now that i'm M-F it's kinda freeing to be able to enjoy a day off knowing i have the next day off as well lol
"A little out of order" While having iron boots which some casual players don't get for like 3 hours
i mean, if you do 3 sequence breaks ina row
like, back in time, then sns skip, THEN early ms like
i dont think even the GAME knows wherew youre supposed to be rn
yep, we  jumped off a bridge for a change of clothes, jumped over another huy for weapons, and now we jumped through some other guys for a BETTER weapon AND the ability to shapeshift
i just got back w a bowl of pasta and all i heard was "how do i ghet edm" and idk if that was what i heard but5 all i could think off was why ar you tryingto get electronic dance music
my pasta is more el dente then id prefer and im sad abt it
interesting that provincial twilight doesnt auto transform you
oh damn you do this trick holy shit
i saw you hit the button???
the bane of tp running existence
i wanna thank you, becous i love Pm and see you with thes rando on yt or live, i enjo it and love it even more then ever before, i get to learn some tricks and gliches and is so mutch fun thank you Phantom
this trick sucks cuz if you fail it you have to wait to drain then go back down
just very annoying compared to failing any other trick
oh its probably a memory thing
we dont know why it works we just know it does
I need to do more glitchless runs '
I finally learned up to master sword
and then I like stopped running lol
now that I think about it, was this a banned trick in season 1
or was it just not worth doing
looking at deku toad through the wall
to get into the mini boss room
So mny tears. Like why so sad?
i see imp midna neuron activate
Game's called TWILIGHT princess for a reason
There's a lot of twilight and Link is the prettiest princess
shadow bug uses using double team its super effective
Finally made my order of cards so...
Some shining sarcophagus deck cards and sky striker
Can you skip the cutscene somehow?
Ah, seems like it takes some practice
look into yeto third eye. fly with wings of soul
They're polite, they'll wait for you to open the door
First dungeon of the category still the forest temple?
I believe the dungeon order is forest > spr > mines > lakebed > arbiter's > tot > city > palace > hyrule
I wonder what Midna thinks of Link just knowing about the mirror, before even assembling the fused shadow
my fav bingo check i have not been able to do  is look into eyes of yeto with a hawkeye
Wait, you can pick items up with the ball and chain? I did not know that
such a cool trick and it isn't even that hard
time for a huge bow gold
Goron mines is awesome, when you don't have to do the bad parts yeah
can you go back and walk on the ceiling for fun
my most hype moments in this game were when links boots electrify, and the ball and chain
also the old goron with the smoke coming out of him
Does the game only check the last piece of it?
thats very silly but thats what makes it so funny
do you REALLY need all 3 pieces or just the very important last piece
or doid allt he elders scramble for eachother to give to gor liggs befire you got there
Bad key design, if only one 3rd of it matters tbh
it saves on memory is probably why they did it that way
but they could have done a bitmask sooooo lazy devs???
and people said i was crazy for liking goron mines so much lmao
goron mines just shot up like 2 tiers on the dungeon tier list
I still liked goron mines before this trick but it's even cooler now
all thanks to the goron mines trick
"Hey wanna transform to a wolf?" "Yes" Midna immediately starts dying
she only had enough power for one last transform.
midna i know you're dying but can you stop breathing on my neck like that
man this place is really flooded
its paved which explains why theres no drainage
meanwhile jovanis house has severe water damage
thankfully he has enough money for repairs
And now to inject Midna with Triforce of Wisdom.exe
"Phew, that was a nice session of being on the brink of death, anyways"
Now your Midna has the ToW
what happened??? some sort of clip went bad or st?
do you think he says fuck you to Link in that scene
Nah, pretty sure he says "Eughhh"
I mean eughhh could be fuck you in boblin
maybe he didn't want Link to understand.
You know how people get *really* mad and they start speaking in their native tongue to cuss someone out?
he wanted to flaunt his multilingual capabilities in front of Link.
As a fluent bublin speaker I can confirm Eughh is a very long articulated insult that would take several paragrahs to say in hylian
yeah I always hate it when speedrunners skip my favorite cutscenes.
They should just let them all play out
I've been wonderin if I should have an option to subtract cutscenes from the total time and let people have their peebreaks when I take 5-6 years to finally make a game, like, as a speed option
How many games even still use in game time though?
Oh, I didn't know Okami did too
But Okami doesn't cut out cutscenes or loads I don't think
If I recall some Sonic games use it?
what is the main benefit of IG vs RTA?
I mean cutting out loads is the biggest part of IGT cause loads are dependent on hardware which differs from player to player especially on PC, it's just not very often games have it.
lots of PC games use autosplitters that pause during loading which gets around that issue for games that don't have IGT
it was at that moment, they knew: they fucked up
Guess Stalord got aHEAD of himself
Hey all! Hope ur valentines day went well! Just came home from Cap America. What an intellectual movie.
I abandoned my coworker to a mess of his own making. Hope he gets out on time.
I heard a part of the music you don't usually hear and instantly knew
Ugh, does Gohma look disgusting in this game
those are rupees not doll hairs
Whoa! You got 20 stinkin' rupees?
Where can I find a list of those community names
Okay, I know Hugo, but which one is Jamal?
Ah, I just call him the pro gamer
As in my current casual playthrough, one of the running jokes is that the shadow beasts are regular people Zant turned into gamers (derogatory)
I would also fuck right off if I had a dragon on my ass
is iron boots a safety strat or st in this fight?
Why do you think they called them Peahats and not Pisscaps
Did you do the new Goron Mines tech in this
I forgot it saves an hour an 20 minutes
Is it almost Zant o' clock?
Awsm time for sure now Max ur audio stream please
its pretty generous the game doesn't even make you restart the whole fight
i appreciate your spirit of learning approach
oh hey youre at a decent pace
surely this is 7 cycle Clueless
I am here. I missed a dungeon or two, please make sure I see all dungeons before ending the run please and thanks :)
This one goes all the way
how could points be pointless!? that's an oxymoron :P
Is there a skip for that
Dinner was fantabulous and for the first time ever i am happy tipsy. Hope u all been great.
I could possibly be wine drunk tonight
What was everyones over all thoughts on Red Hulk and Super saijin 4 being canon?
oh so u dont follow any of the mega anime. The one im most impatient for is Kaiju no 8
You want to know what I did with my free will today? I ate dessert before dinner
i think there was only ever 1 time i ate desert first and that was when i helped making the rice pudding that day
It was good! Hope the run is going well!
And loved that sound alert yammibYugiLaugh
Yeah! Haven't played through OG in quite some time, so revisiting it
lose 1 minute every attempt (+ however many seconds to rng)
my first all dungeons run ever spent 30 minutes on it because I was on the hard mindset of "don't reset first run"
I have to relearn pillar clip ugh
elh not viable in all dungeons I'm sad
ask and you shall receive lol
Isn't that cutscene like Zelda being like oh hi Link please help Ganon is fucking shit up.
bro was in the loading zone
you know what they should've given us in hyrule warriors?
shirtless sumo link as a costume too :P
if sephiroth gets to be shirtless in smash let link be shirtless in hyrule warriors :P
we should reset if we fail box breaker
those 2 frames are super important
so this AD route can only do wolf bombhouse skip huh
so you get eldin vessel, get a couple of the bugs, get the city cannon, then do boomerang and forest templle
then after forest you warp to kak and finish
yo gl Phantom and gg on the fat PB yesterday too
ohhh you finish it after zd portal
now I have an excuse to not learn wolf bomb house skip
yeah, i have to learn it first
kitty climb actually did not influence it
I wanted to get a 2:56 before doing AD
and it just so happened kitty climb got found the same day I got that time
I've already re-learned a few things that I did in glitchless (ookless and some tot stuff) but haven't done much
Anybody elses wind knocking out their power?
explosion so powerful it blew a hole in reality too
If you pb I'll stick that pillar up my asshole
To be fair I don't expect anything out of any run
No run is safe until Zelda is done
It also took me 18 years to realize rutela's theme is just a remix of serenade
wait till you hear about Windfall and Outset island, Pichu
I'm here to kill time till I have to clean off cars 😩
it's currently a wintry mix so I don't wanna do it if the car will just freeze over
Oh yeah I live in Canada's armpit
Pidgey do you live with Elsa or what the fuck
got a lot of snow up where I'm at that then changed over to rain so I had to get up at like 6 AM to clean it all before it became 200lbs from all the water.
we have like 2 and a half feet of snow on the back porch from the last few weeks
Omg you live in the Sonoran desert?
That's in like California I think
Oh actually it's mostly in AZ and Mexico but some of it is in Cali yeah. South of you though.
It's the Mojave Desert pretty sure.
Do you think if the bugs finished eating the light we would have seen some real gnarly creatures? You think they can do more than just grow?
clearly that means watching the cutscene is faster than skipping :P
I mean yeah it's right next to Lanayru so why wouldn't you go there next?
isn't it triple frame perfect technically cause you have to release A too right?
could be worse tho, could be 10 hours
I don't miss doing them remotely at all
Yall are fucked up from capitalism you know that? I wish u all a very good rest
luckily I think I'll get 3 days off this week
my hands are fucked up, fingers hurt when I touch stuff LUL
Look into Yeto eyes for free timeloss
this is like a studio ghibli movie setup
to find the divine beast within?
boy lost in the snowy mountains meets a yeti, snow slides down a mountain, and then hangs out with 2 yetis, 1 of them goes evil, gets saved, roll credits
i like Link Twilght's Pro Snowboarder, amazing game
pictured: me digging out the cars
nice rocket rolls up to the boss door
Isn't there a pot with hearts inside?
oh god I have to fight the chilfos with just b&c
no bomb arrows in this route...
The game really tried to kill you
it just feels so slow lol
she's totally not looking into his eyes in the slightest
I think the slash was angled too much to the right
how much time does this trick save?
it skips the first key shard and the long magnetic ceiling room
I think if you fail it the way you did it should only cost like 5 seconds if you don't jumpslash over the railing
for that one you actually don’t want to be super close to the edge it’s really weird
the closer you are to the edge the more likely it fails for literally no reason
i agree it’s not really clear at all
it's a thing you have to feel out
you should target while swimming up, it'll help you judge the height better
well, this is a bad screen to come in on
Have a good night see ya next stream.
not quite the same as NSMB
already almost done with the new trails game peepoSad
Is that a new skip? I thought you had to use LZS to get past the toads
so how does one define a "major" sequence break? phanto274Thonk
guess what i can say i happily match ur bed now. I got the mini starter evolution backpack from spencers/hottopic
are there any decent rpgs that have come out in the last few years
i feel like the last fun turn based rpg i played was bug fables
i want ni no kuni 3 or something man
i think i liked 2 more than 1
yeah the raid battles were kinda ass
i don't remember ni no kuni 2 that well
but i only beat it once
I didn't know they kept making vallyria chronicles games. I enjoyed the first one
Give me a break wait don't you'll invalidate the run
i always see 4 on sale for like 8 bucks
Don't threaten me with a good time Kaiba boy
This shall be it I believe!
Why are they named after him then?
Did he just start using them in runs first?
That was the run that got me into pape
Err actually i think it was 2015
And then I went back and watched pie's run
Pape pretty much is kicked out of gdq
I really love Malleo's TTYD TASes
I want more TASes at GDQs
Speaking on Tases how pumped are u for the mm reveal this weekend?
true dat when beest and green suigi are the human tasbots themselves
awsm start but alas gotta head out for some errands.
So I just checked my Highlight count recently.... frick
I may or may not have to move 600 Hrs of stuff to my SSD
Same, it's just slow going on my end
How've you been? Haven't check in with a busy month at work
My Highlights are more of a "Let's Stream" series for a few games. Those are the ones really jamming up my storage. Literally >100 hours of that is just Star Trek Online
(Highly recommend, great story, no paywalls for it)
Also it'd be nice if Twitch could prep more than 3 VODs at a time
I plan on DLing and reuploading later, don't have a VOD channel yet on YT
That's on my to-do list too
oh i had 90s of delay lol
I liked it but never played anything that used it lol
nah i paid 7tv for prety name plate
Omg it’s a Phantom stream LETSPAPERMARIO
I’ll hold your beer while you save time dw
We need to have a talk if you're cheating on minors Stare
Hey mid, how's hell I mean master duel
I haven’t played since our matches KEKW
Same, I got into zzz and I can't stop
As a kid I counted emerldShrug
But also I had to count postman because it was fucking 2003
Toad is throwing for content Madge
You sound like it’s time for tequila
do you have to charge the belly flop
I only ever did all cards
i have it on my pc lol
all of mine i at least have a recording of still on my pc
i'll start cleaning everything up for me personally soon
if no one else does maybe i'll archive wrs
i just need to have enough hd space lmao
sorry was distracted is this for gless
i have no idea what this routes coins are lol
yeah would just need to time everything lol
idk how fast fire flower fight is
idk what a good ch1 time is with glitches
or if fright jars could be used and it becomes like glitchless beginning
yeah im sure spook helps a lot
Good luck on this attempt ukyotpPray
i feel like 4 is more rare then the others
cool that you can play the game solely on muscle memery
yo lopez ty for the gl
What if you didn't use logic in your argument
but then you can still cut corners
yo plant ty for the gl
yo phantom ty for the gl
that's so hard to do lol
also sonic racing crossworlds is fun as fuck
obviously some stuff may change in the final release but what they have now is incredibly solid.
the ffz effect makes it look extra evil lmao
You gotta pick up slow go instead
if you 5th try speedy then?
also you get to customize the color of your car, and since you can't overlay stickers on each other i just made my car trans flag colored (and the cockpit ace flag colored lol)
last thing i'm gonna say about crossworlds: Cream just bobs her head back and forth and it's adorable and it's also like how i feel. i'm just there to have fun lol
Aaah ok, makes sense (i think)
I'm pretty new to the whole mario speedrun shtick but i can guess why people don't like all bosses
Yknow, despite my incredibly big mario interest, I've never finished a paper mario game, i heard they're good tho, like the best mario story games out there or something
nmg is just dont use srm
one more week til monster hunter releases :D
one more week until i dont play monster hunter still
Pillar clip is actually gonna make me rage quit TP phanto274S
It should be to me which is the rage inducing part lol
so I can suggest a speed run with channel points right
what if I also Ask you to race me in said speed run I suggest
is TP on the list Kappa
I was gonna ask if you wanna race a glitchless master sword some point was all
if you wanna do post master sword then I'd just have to learn the route
its only 3 hours if you're bad trust
that was my second run of it though
I would choose any other speed run but I dont know any other one
I cant say "lets race any%" cuz I cant fucking do shield sword skip
and also pillar clip is trash
@nozomup yeah it is making me crash out lmao
How is my son Agumon doing
And how is your son Gomumon doing
this category is more like adr i think
When are you going to accept my 1v1 challenge in Digimon Rumble Arena 2 for Nintendo GameCube Phantom gminus1Mad
i thought touching the buttons was good
Why do I need to look away?
@Gay_Plant i know you from bsky phanto274Wave
I didn't just download the visual novel Euphoria because I'm a coward
I wanna give him a hug
How does Watt talk with a pacifier in her mouth
that was an amazing outing and what an eppy
....did we just teach you that
@LunaAmethyst my toddler does it all the time
I will never get over the screaming Shy Guys
I wonder what Skolar's eyes look like under his glasses
That would be horrifying and hilarious
Yeah, try shocking the being literally MADE of electricity
Muskular....and he doesn't look physically different from the others body wise
LMAO I got off the phone with my friend and didn’t realize I had your stream going still. those noises confused tf out of me
Muskular flexing would be like that one close up image of SpongeBob trying to flex
Is this the really bad thing you mentioned earlier?
Gourmet Guy implies that Shy Guy masks are part of their flesh
Unless he magically got a new mask
how do you keep b held down
Muskular has cool older brother energy
I like how this game really feels like a team effort from Team Mario and Team Peach
i dont remember if you were apart of the conversation, but when mark ran pape, i used to hold the b button down, becasue we didnt know about the unplug thing. and i got the nickname the clamp
Bombette's different colors in the randomizer just make me think of different gumball flavors
and there was a point where i said i was going to run pape and beat marks place on the leaderboard and arie said "THE CLAMP WILL SURPASS IT'S MASTER"
I had a thought a bit ago
last minute I decided to join season 4
If you destroy a place with lava, does it count as arson
I dunno if lava can activate things that aren't flame resistant
I assume not, cuz it's heat
I think arson involves setting fire to something with the intention of causing damage, and lava wouldn’t generally fall under that definition unless human actions caused it to affect property in such a way.
Yeah, was thinking of that scenario
If by some bs someone had enough lava to spill on a whole building
Man, can't believe Kolorado's fuckin dead
I assume that damage is for Peril strats
Unless it's otherwise crucial to burn Mario to a crisp for the run
The captions turned that whole thing into a command for specifically me
People figured out how to access training mode in the fatal fury beta already lol
The functionality is in the damn beta you just can't access it so you hover over the tutorial and change the value by 1 number and it clicks training mode lol
I have no fucking clue why they limited it
So they specifically put tmode in here LOL
I got bored very quickly in tmode tho the combos are mad boring in this game
You just learn what ex string to use in order for each button and there's nothing else
Any technicality is in the parrying
And I dont like parries kazamsCatglub
Oh yea I suppose it would make more sense than her still LOL
I'm really starting to feel how the game was rushed out though but overall it's been fun
looks scarier than it is for sure
Compared to standard Mario, Paper Mario is a bit shorter
Woa G is as super as mario
one more fp would be nice lol
I hope mwsf games list gets decided soon
I gotta plan my spring lol
Yea esp for you who needs to fly out here
If I dont need to hotel there I'm gonna try to get to the seven spires concert in chicago at the end of may instead if I can figure out someone to go with
I love how unreadable the dizzy emoji is on the overlay
is the pb on YouTube i can go check real quick
Will the King give us a run?
oh god this fuck ass attack
i legitimately forget up and away existed
my all cards pb dinked on the front ghost :)
I'm excited for potential project in pipe line
it'll only be a go if I can get the twist to work
bought powdered pigments that change colours with heat
so end goal will be for plush, but it'll be so much cooler with context of character
I just need to see if I can paint pigment onto fabric and do overall experimenting
because idea won't work with out it
and now time to drop some mlp related context
oh thank god it was done already
because of course its a mlp plush LUL
i remember playing this on my eee pc at like 5 fps back in like 2010
you got two characters Cadence and Chrysalis. Chrysalis is a shapeshifter, she has taken the guise of Cadence.
and the setting is it's Cadence's Wedding.
Anyways Cadence has purple eyes, Chrysalis has green eyes. Throughout the episode "Cadence's" eyes flash green *audience hint that something is not right here*
is this the all cards turbo charge fight or is quick change a thing here
my success rate in all cards is literally 100% but also like 5% in glitchless so
So the plush will be of "Cadence" but wait, no it's not! It's Chrysalis disguised as Cadence. Because the eyes will change from Purple to Green with heat
what is this, like 4 turns without them
i think that was max length
it's like 2 to 4 turns im pretty sure, felt like 4
i think he is likely to shield on the turn you outta sighted
solid full look see  of the game
i stopped counting after 2 cuz that's just bad
but since he delayed boots again it might not have mattered
Turns out my last cards that I ordered a while ago will probably arrive after this weekend for some reason
I will still have to order a couple for one of my 3 decks
just made an omelet, working on oatmeal
Turns out one of the card stores near me has a good stock of things I needed
Magic, Yugioh and Pokémon all in this store
what soundtrack is this song from?
Longest VG song I know of off the top of my head is like 11 minutes. I'm sure there's plenty longer ones tho.
just sub 4 this stream, this run, rn
I fucking hate trying to practice tp and gz just not fucking working
I keep loading it and it's just not functioning
i cant do the button combo to get the menu up
there should be a "no tricks that suck ass" category for all games :D
Let Phantom5800 know you want to drop in and collaborate!
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
I have to basically do the route to practice sword and shield skip lul
you know what nvm fuck this shit lol
this is why I dont run glitched categories
I was doing sword and shield but its fucking dumb and annoying
im already aggravated cuz of gz not working and not only do you have to do this trick you also have to do another stupid trick right after it
it feels pointless to do as a beginner
lose 50 minutes to two hard tricks back to back
look i tried for the charmy
work was very boring today but at least I had funny blowjob cucumber to laugh at
And now I get to open tomorrow kazamsCatglub
I think I'd get fired if I tried them out
I always thought his design was a little too weird
Boy does he make good soup though
Just in the nick of time !yank
including everyone's marathon runs. Had to cancel my usual movie outing to see Dogman for it.

Did u look into the new epic clip find for this place?
I thought hitting the cutscene always pushed you off
tfw i remember i can add emotes
you should post it in the tp discord
i gotta delete some emotes on my 7tv
L E T S G O R O N
feli my light blinked three times. what does this mean.
are you performing sorcery on my house
i was playing mario eclipse instead
honestly the best fish game ive played isn't even a proper fish game
its streetpass mii plaza's ultimate angler
i keep having dreams about an ex who wasn't really my ex
i was wondering what you were trying to do that clip is insane
i love people who do that
its just like lost woods and the spirit  tracks overfield theme
someone reuploaded animal crossing 5pm and just called it their own song
youtube copyright is really dumb, twitch too lol
i tried to report things like that on youtube, but only the original copyright owner can do that apparently lol
just gotta send nintendo an email with the youtube video
i had a crush on someone i used to work with who just went into intimate detail about their bf experience and it broke me
not sure how to resolve my feelings so they disappear from my dreams
yeah i almost wish bark was its own button because like if you're not frame perfect you have to hear midnas weird moans
you can mash but its a specific rhythm
i probably wouldn't mind as much if she had alternate sounds
but its always the same sound
How's being a furry for 5 hours?
did they change it from a chest at the last minute
i was watching brianmp16 do a rando and he needed milk in the gibdo house but the cow gave him magic jar instead it was a meme
How's the run? I see green
Wait say what? Is this glitched?
I'm on my phone so I can't really see the words on screen
Something is missing...like a lot -.-
I think you were slightly too diagonal
Can you create save states for practice?
Yeah analog glitches and delays fucking suck man
also yes, its waaay too stiff for what its meant to do
yeah the GC dpad is like made for ants it's way too tiny
my dream is a modular GC controller like the xbox has but it would easily be 300 usd
with swappable N64 / GC / sony parts
i got the switch wireless one that uses batteries but its not 1:1 with the original shape and the triggers aren't analog
also I don't like the c-stick on the GCC for any game outside of smash tbh.
the c stick is alright for sunshine
I just want dpad to have the option to be buttons not only for n64 but for rhythm games and gba
At this moment it's just completing it?
it'd be a bit late for a 2nd run unless it's something else that's short.
just enough time for kuru kuru kururin
I did an entire speedrun without realizing the B button made you go faster
I was like god how are these guys so fast i suck ass
this is easily the worst dungeon room
I made it for Zantboi LETGORON
do you think midna ignored her job on purpose so she could have some time with this fine hunk of man
he says that he picks the stronger side
idk if thats true actually lmao
so maybe he works for link after he defeats ganon
“Fuck off… thanks for the arrows” KEKW
I got my sub 3:10 finally Phantom NODDERS
imagine if the white cat was with them
or the entire horde of cats
nice i just hit 900k points
nah the cat jumps up and solos all of em
Holy fuck tiger are you sharing with the class
Ggs on fulfilling your furry journey
my furry journey is never over
urooglGG silent1053GG avarie1GG phanto274GG marcoWin tippiWin
three people pb'd in tp today
Omg you don’t have LETSGORON Sadge
oh wait ganon says it's not over :P
Nah I’m gonna play yugioh KEKW
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I was about to say glubbers not on so it’s a hard choice lol
Again waiting for a few cards to come in before I purchase more cards
gl on the run i am lurking
my friend hit affiliate today so i am hanging out over there
I still have yet to play TP and I want to so bad!! but finding a physical copy is so hard and expensive!
kicking myself for loosing my copy of tphd
still have the midna amiibo tho
@Cowbungo101 friend, have you heard of the wonder world of emulation ? ? ? ?
yar har a pirate is thee
OH, A PIRATE'S LIFE IS A WONDERFUL LIFE
@buff00n ya i know i know but I really want a physical copy of this game and WW :P
I wish you luck, mate. People charge crazy $ cuz they can.
people charge crazy $ bcuz crazier people out there will PAY that $
Hey Phantom when can we expect a Low% run of this game? cowbunEyes cowbunStraw cowbunNana
Wolf Link with the Hylian Shield on his back goes foolish
What was your PB last night?
Nah Jamal needs to be better MadgeRn
Thats really unfortunate. I hate EMS
Ofc you get it as soon as you reset it always happens
It’s hot as balls in my apartment. feels like summer now that we’re in the positives again KEKW
i wonder if link is a fan of limp bizkit. keep rollin rollin rollin rollin
Nothing wrong with a 4:40 cage break Sadge
Guys is it just me or has this month been like crazy long? and there’s only 28 days in it KEKW
oh no. how are you going to make up those 10 secs
How is it only the 23rd
what do you mean february? its 9 jan
Hey is it safe to download gamecube roms in the sense of internet companys and whatnot?
how is it ALREADY the 23rd
@stalkor I would cry if it was still January
@Midnaliin I'll add onto that that last month also felt comically long. This whole year is dragging
@L1nk2001 thats not something we can discuss on twitch
@L1nk2001 Piracy is a crime and crime doesn't pay :P
I know! It feels like it should be at least mid March
ahhhh very bad dont do it
try having a baby. time is just a fleeting thought
I own them its just in a storage unit SadgeCry
I don’t want any babies anytime soon KEKW
why do you need to talk to him so many times is it just that he goes through all of the required dialogues up to that point?
i wonder if ganon and that wrestle guy are related
Who knows, maybe they are work buddies
hey he could be albino gerudo
Then again, Ganondorf is green. Also not the skin tone of other gerudo
a lot of ganon portrayals turn him into a moster with similar fangs to bo beau ehh wrestle guy
I mean he was also green in other games that do have gerudo
Woah that's actually pretty cool so she doesn't show up
i wonder if that could happen
The jump before scene or the pile up?
why are you calling justin hugo?
Oh yeah it happened to me sometimes
Game had to balance it out somehow I guess
Mr Phantom, I humbly request that you get another PB, especially now that I am here to see all the dungeons correctly this time
Its confusing to me bc people will say “oh Jamal is guaranteed to give you a slow one within 3 swings” and I took that advice and also ended up dying cuz it was 3 fast swings
It really is so RNG which is annoying
D: Phantom you can't just target kids
@Zeliversal idk, after what he did in Majora's mask, I think it's reasonable
@zeliversal you can...just gotta get them ice cream after they cry
A person of culture and class
How does rare even taste? Like I know medium rare is chewy, medium is stuck in teeth, and anything after that is rubber
Or less, depending on your vantage point
It is more cooked or less rare
true gamers eat the cow while it's still standing :)
Madge Don't tell Midna to shut up
those loud MOOOO are the best
I just never got to find out because I've never heard anyone say they like rare
@OhHeyItJaye Truer gamers eat the cow before it's even born. Now THAT'S rare
I believe in the mid game time save NODDERS
nah, eating the cow before it's born
No gotta eat the cow when it was planned out
Gotta eat the first atom to ever exist, as that could at some point become a cow
You gotta be careful about that lilly...you could accidentally become a cannibal
Damn, I hate rng when it comes to steak
isn't technically everything the first atom to ever exist
@AnniLyn2 Yeah, I don't mind, just another name to add to the collection
@thebloodlilly nobody has called you lil?
I busted a nut on Nancy instead LMAO
Can that be added to the quotes? Lolz
oh I didn't know VIPs could do it too
lemme find exactly what you said PrideLaugh
I’m gonna add all the quotes when I redeem VIP (in the nursing home in 60 years)
I got mixed up with another format PrideLaugh
I checked the clip, it was just a green
yeah I think the lighting just made it look yellow-ish
I swear this tree is so lenient until it comes to the run smh
Diababa throwing a tantrum before dying
The bot is very upset today KEKW
60% of the time, it works every time
Bot having a breakdown and then wishes death
I practiced that for hours yesterday so I have it down more now KEKW
You were too far from the pillar
Like as you were going down
I felt that sarcasm from here
How did you go into the miniboss like that wtf
Uhh I can try lol. so basically in forest temple you do BITE which is back in time equipped. this lets you get early boss flags which gives you not only the monkeys early to do Ook but it allows for the deku toad to be there early. so you can enter from the exit
it’s kind of confusing especially cuz I’m not good at explaining stuff KEKW
My brain cannot comprehend the words that are being written there but i think i understand it
Ohh that’s right I explained any% smh
I barely understand the howling stone stuff for AD
No I mean how it all works out for EBF lmao
Can you at least tell me what ebf stands for...
Why did my brain thought epic British food
Early boss flex more like Kappa
And I just reread the exp..
bdsm sounds like a fun trick
if you're into that sort of thing
what did I just enter into
You're participating in it too Zeli, you're literally using caps in some of the words you're typing
Glubbers named it BDSM (not surprisingly)
.... I'm sorry what does BDSM have to do with TP ? ? ?
I don't think you should use your wii in bed @annilyn2
@AnniLyn2 for a sec I thought this was another TP category :P
I see. Well, carry on, I suppose
@cpapumisterioso1503 no but someone can use their wii
@darkness3827 you do sometimes need toilet paper afterwards so..
Dry my uh...tears for the spring gods
@cpapumisterioso1503 Unfortunately this is the GC version :(
can you do BDSM on the Wii?
If you try hard enough yeah
yeah whoever thought having enemies where you can't leave 1 alive was a good idea should be docked like a week's worth of pay
bro flew across the galaxy for that kill
yeah phantom when you goin back to the ruins?
What is wrong with me and KB3. good thing I’m practicing cuz bro hit me again KEKW
I am being way too slow but I was too stubborn to back up and have it be slow
you accidentally turned on grass-sanity clearly so all the rupees got shuffled elsewhere.
me when phantom made grass sanity early
Gonna lurk but GL with the rest phanto274Mash
I wonder what the hold back is on it
I assume they have to rework the way logic currently works to fit the tricks in
I mean there's no rule against us just making them ourselves
and I doubt they'd be like "oh you're doing the work for us oh nooo stop that"
I could ask and look into it
I have a local version of the generator too
so I could probably do full blown testing
I still have 1.2 generator locally
My program is doing something completely unexpected and I don't know how or why or who
I do know what and when
is it a good unexpected or a bad unexpected?
In terms of program's objective and outcome? Good. In terms of understanding the impact of changes? Bad.
I should find a game to learn to speedrun but idk what. The problem is I don't like learning glitches and I don't like menuing and I don't like going fast. :P
my favorite snowboarding sequence in any zelda game
i mean, arguably shield surfing down hebra in BotW/TotK is just as much of snowboarding :P
whenever you jump off the stairs in the first room I always think you messed up but then I remember LUL
Ok... this problem is even more confusing now
fuckin this church ass room up
Why do they have a church in their house?
So it's not the source of the data. Because I tested converting from each other, and I get exactly the same results. One format causes one output, the other format causes the other. But if not the data, and the logic should otherwise be identicial why am I getting different results NotLikeThis
Phantom you know a thing or two
What devil did my witchcraft of a code make a deal with?
Madge I'm gonna be angry if it was Zant
No code in my house makes a deal with Zant
the code looked into the eyes of yeto to create true beauty clearly
ACTION looks into reflection, sees self
Well that was a f'ing lie
let me tell you a story.   *leaves*
link's biggest weakness, tiny changes in elevation
how much money do you need for the whole game?
i still technically have a few to get but those are guaranteed
no Bo gold but at least Bow gold.
current challenge league board had an achievement from it so i figured why not, set isn't that bad overall
I keep thinking it's gonna be a gold and then remember there's 50 minutes of dialogue after you kill a boss.
well at least you get 45 rupees back
cept for the beautiful eyes of Yeto we gotta have extra time to look at those.
what in the upwarp happened there? lol
is this the mario sunshine boss where you clean its teeth
closing in on sub 4 sum of bests
who keeps that many pots up there???
they're kinda asking for them to get knocked over tbh.
In Link's defense he's not really used to being a wolf, it's prolly pretty tough to learn how to run on 4 legs instead of 2.
ive been lurking and listening the entire timebut the HEWOO i needed to comment on lol
I give this ladder a 4/10
i found a new way to run Battle Network in archipelago
this ladder is getting a 10/10 tho it's just fuckin majestic.
I took the 4.5 box art for AP
Ok. I have eliminated up to a certain part of the code as the source
This is extremely confusing and slightly painful
what are the aspects that make a bad rando?
banjo tooie rando will eventually get a version not archipelago so ive been trying to learn checks cause we wont have auto tracker for that
If the prologue was important it'd still be in the armaturelouge
emerald on hardware is huge for me
idk what games make sense to be AP only, I guess stuff that doesn't make sense as a solo rando but idk how many games couldn't work solo.
Like i see games on gamecube id like to run but it doesnt work on hardware
Like Id like to try luigis mansion at least once
then I see I need to install dolphin and i get turned off by that
Like I've played the Jak 1 rando on AP, idk if I'd ever play it solo but I'm sure it's not the worst game ever for a rando.
i have nothing against emulation, people can play however they want. For me its more, my original hardware should be able to run it so im not going out of my way for dolphin
I know i havent been around much, have you returned to GCN retro achievements?
i know my prime is in your queue
enemies that freeze you randomly, another game design decision that should definitely cost someone a few $.
enemy design in TP is pretty good ngl
yeah cept for the redeads and the ghost rats and the shadow beasts
oh and ball and chain guy is another annoying dude mechanically.
yeah true it's more the room than him on his own.
No, but my teachers sure used to think that's why we owned them
That's why I haven't died yet
I almost bought a running shoe yesterday called Novablast
that sounds both extremely painful and also some new hip chiropracty practice
cause I bought a different brand online FeelsBadMan
Hey, that's Demise's gimmick from Skyward Sword!
you take that spike outta your head stallord
People hated on it more when it came out
i didn't like the sailing portion of it myself
Wind waker was also pretty hated on when it came out cause of how cartoony it was afaik.
crazy that WW only has like, 4 dungeons. 5 if you count Forsaken Fortress
@Darkness3827 most brutal Ganondorf death tho
just played the new Sonic Racing
fav 2D Zelda's between Minish Cap and ALtt
don't trust anyone who tells you OoT is the best Zelda
i'm of the controversial opinion that zelda is just an overrated franchise
I mean there's only OoT, MM, WW, TP, SS, BotW, TotK right?
BotW and TotK are fine, but they're not what I want / expect from Zelda
@buff00n then what is the best
WW was the only zelda game i could actually finish\
SS was okay but only after it came out on Switch
ofc its a real question LOL
I don't like MM but I feel like that's a me specific thing lol.
every other one i played just bored me to death and that includes BOTW
@Darkness3827 MM is polarizing and I get it
if you just deleted the timer MM might be my fave game tbh lol.
im gonna say the funny phrase
okay but did you get hit in a fast way
I believe in golds from here on out NODDERS
taking damage to save time, the speedrun way
I can’t believe it’s been that long already phanto274S
how is the AD, treating you. looks pretty good over the last few days based on the splits I saw
No way, I can’t believe you have time save on shitty in the sky BatChest
Does any runner like this dungeon?
Okay so it’s just you and Justin lmao
Guessing it’s way more fun with glitches then?
What does that do? keep the fan from turning on?
Okay this looks way more fun than glitchless
no dealing with helmasaurs left right and centre and skipping gaps easily
do you have to deal with the peahat room glitchless or nah? I feel like that's the worst room of the dungeon at least from a boredom perspective lol.
So the reason is because I'm doing a math check, to see if a value is equal to or less than X value, right?
I meant to pour coke and rum but I wasn’t thinking and poured coke and tequila KEKW this should be interesting
The integer math sees: 6351 <= 6351. So that's true...
The floating math sees 63.510000000000005 <= 63.51 which is false
That's where my bug is coming from
And this is exactly why I switched to integer math YEP
And now I'm debating do I run a quick patch on the floating point to see if I get the same results now
yeah this might as well be a different game
if it's not frame perfect it's a trash run
Link why tf do you jump off when he falls to the ground instead of just stabbing him 30 more times, this fight would be so much quicker if you did that...
Uhm. I'm not sure exactly what type of answer you're looking for
But I'm going with a pursuit enemy
Ngl I literally never made the connection to it being a floormaster KEKW
I always thought of them in context of Phantom Zant
but if we played it Who Wants to be a Millionare style, I might have selected an incorrect option
I was just like "Uh... Hand.. Phantom Zant... Zant... Hand"
If I had just played Wind Waker or something with a floor master *maybe* I would see what you're talking about
I was racking my brain and couldn’t remember what floor masters and wall master were called lmao
my brain was like, what are the red and blue hands called Hmm
All those small keys and Zant couldn't even invest in a shut-in lock
was doing some ac wild world speedruns
yeah ig locking things is more common in the twilight realm
got some solid attmepts but nothing spectacular
it's broken af, make town, do chores, do ACE, get money, finish chores, pay off debts
i've got a lot of games in the works atm, hard to focus
Bonking into that wall being faster threw me the first few times
wow bro hits like a truck
I think I can work on that spreadsheet after I come back from FF 👁️
It's mostly something I'm v interested in so I'd be more than happy to assist
Also been busy as hell this week swifFlop
Lead up to FF always keeps me busy
Gonna level with u, being dead kinda sucks ngl
Also high key waiting for the comfy friends eevee to drop in the us
I know you were eyeing the espeon lol
eh, depends, is zelda gonna steal some from you for the horseback section?
I thought the announcement was a cheap viewers message ngl
I saw one earlier in another stream lol
When King Bulblin does more than Beast Ganon GIGACHAD
I mean he is the King
Swift I broke my code but it's okay because then I fixed it and now it's not as broken
Yeah Ganondorf definitely isn't king enough
my hand was not in the right spot
someone redeem yugioh i don't have enough points
Not Good Ganondorf. He was never good. He was always evil
I have one for every game
TP is DG. WW is SG. OoT is different SG. SS is DD
bad boi for pbing punishment ensues
tuffy is not racing but ukyo is
Hey hey GL for runs. How are you feeling this day ?
@blacktiger51 my man, wuz poppin' Yo
@buff00n chilling man what's up with you
also chillin' I should go get some water, but I don't feel like leaving the house atm
and for pape plando are some traps ok? i have some funny things plans
@blacktiger51 Did you see Phantom's plans? :P
@Darkness3827 no KEKW i been playing trails through daybreak 2 and done now so back more
check the randos channel in the discord lol
yeah it's not really a rando if you know where everything is
only way would be if you made it then like waited 10 years to play it so you forgot everything
I'm gonna start cooking 1 so redeem coming in like a week maybe
i do have to make sure my logic works
yeah but i am gonna plando everything
so turn everything on and hope for the best NOTED
every badge is 10 BP and every move is 75 FP challenge run :P
hope the page saved cuz this gonna take a few days
idk I think having it and then seeing how absurdly expensive it is is funnier. Especially if it's like the first pick up LUL
ooh starting with power bounce! wonder how much it costs? Sees costs. *weeps*
ok i am not that evil
999 cost Speed Spin in toad town shop
oh nice i can plando bosses
hmm maybe no dungeon er then
wonder if shops item that cost like 11 coins works
it let me put a trap in the shop i doubt that work KEKW
I think I'm a tad behind
I'm probably not but it feels like it
I wonder if its possible to just do the intro normally and then do ems
maybe I should just learn 100%
I mean I dont have to do any of that in glitchless either
but Im only doing master sword runs
damn he fucked that rock up
I had to head out...my grandma called
You have one thing go right and the rest give you a finger to the face
I fucking hate when I get one wrong move with Bo and everything is just going downhill
currently playin b3313, noticed I should actually sort my notes, and uhhh
200 lines to still sort in, each being separate "this goes there" lines 😅
i have a new keyboard and mouse cause i was having issues with the old one
SM64 mod, lots of beta content and a bit of stanley's parable
just some basic logitech ones, nothing fancy. i just need functional lol
what was your old mouse doin?
Let’s get those peanut butters phanto274Mash
the mouse was doubleclicking on its own, and the keyboard was starting to have stuck keys
stuck keys suck, but nothin ya couldnt clean if ya feel like it
i could clean it, but it was also old and some letters were worn off
all my mice have so far broken down w double / no left or right click issues
after about a year of that, I then usually give in
currently on a G502 cus it was dirt cheap
the doubleclicking was mostly my fault, i'm too fast with cookie clicker lmfao
new mouse is a G203 i think
Cookie clicker, destroyer of mice everywhere
he just has restless leg syndrome, okayh
i'm gonna keep typoing til i get used to this new keyboard methinks lmao
@Mirby_Studios I broke my left click with uhhhh.... minecraft I think last was the case
then had that mouse for another 3 years and just lived with it as much as it was shit
@Mirby_Studios if it fits the budget, a G305 I think is not bad either?
I always get keyboards that go first, my standard keyboard has pretty nasty chatter
dunno if that one's wired or not though, depending on what your preference is
my requirements were cheap, wired, and has back/forward buttons on the side
my last keyboard was done cus it was ghosting my inputs
i saw this one and went for it lol
either not or double sending letters nasty like (wireless)
I think my model was like, Logitech g pro wired? It's fantastic
my current one is shit, is a handmedown which I need to get rid of
yeah that's another reason i replaced the keyboard, who knows what's in there that i failed to clean up over the years lmao
some keys get stuck cus of the previous user, sometimes it decides not to properly type or eat words for some odd reason
I should probably do a deep clean of my keyboard, might help with some of the chatter
cleaning keyboards easy though p4ntzThink just gotta get all keycaps off then you could literally (ofc power cable if wired properly sealed from fluids) throw it in the dishwasher lmfao
then let the thing dry out for like a good... hour or so, more if its not dry around so the water properly can rinse out by means of time
better ofc if ya do it with IPA, though then you're doing it manually
that's a bit too much for me lol
Yeah no ill stick with the isopropyl
it's hard enough for me to have the energy to wash actual dishes i ain't gonna do all that for a keyboard lmao
meanwhile I have done that a COUPLE times just with a basic brush
took all keycaps off, dusted the thing out
I have too many memes to send all the time
and the keycaps you can 100% throw in the sink with soap water
that sounds like a lot of work when i could just not lol
its literally like 10 minutes tops PrideLaugh
worse then 10 minutes for takin the keycaps off is puttin them back on
it's the process that i can already tell would set my back issues off lol
hell hear me out mirby: you more of a "cheap keyboard" or a "maybe mechanical" person w keyboards?
curious since w mechanical keyboards you usually also get key pullers
like i said i just need functional
tldr though: those key pullers you push onto the key, then pull off tippiTap
I made the switch back to mechanical, I do love my keyboard
also a bit of a reason as to why I am like "oh its easy"
cus while I am on membrane rn, I do have the key pullers
cus FUUCK breaking a keycap PrideLaugh
I want like. The noise level of red but the clickiness of brown
Reds are quiet and for speed
for me browns would be the way to go honestly
I write a lot so like. STIMULATION
blues are lighter then reds yea? I got that color scheme right in my head?
It prolly does exist but gl finding anything but like the four big switch types these days
wanna say ya can see it disappearing at least?
like dark grey pufts of wind when ya swing the lantern?
yea the hitbox always is a bit shit w that mist last I recall
Oh I've never seen that glitch
why did my brain think you were doing glitchless
link with his detachable spine on horseback KEKW
I wish we got to see this fight later in the game
It feels weird pacing wise here
so how and what does back in time affect KEKW
this looks sooo cursed to my brain in terms of what when where 🤣
more like "oh look its back in time"
If you're not fucking with flag states to do things in convoluted manners, is it really a Zelda speedrun
@FatPidgeyBirb you mean, an Action adventure speedrun? CorgiDerp
cus I could swear if it wasnt for EXP being technically present in Pape, you do a LOT of that in there too
Oh, you absolutely do it in some pape speedruns too
Outta curiosity, would bow fuck up this fight
Oh, so it doesn't softlock it or anything
bomb arrows would save a couple seconds over ookless
but for the route it's not faster
you'd have to 2 trip forest temple
I'm always intrigued by programming choices
it'ss ok it's not humanly doable
Ye, he's been dabbling in oot too I think
hey i have a defeat ganon time before i met her Kappa
Speak of the morp and he shall appear
back when defeat ganon was boomer ganondoor
bit sad that you still gotta do these three things here
you need to clear it in any% because you need the rock that spawns in death mountain to unthaw ZD
and lanayru needs to be done to access the desert
but I am surprised no one has found OoB to get to snowpeak yet
but yeah there's no known way to start lanayru twilight without clearing eldin first
you can get to snowpeak during lanayru twilight
this game was 30, not 60 right?
then at least its "lenient" but yea
this evening was watching a donk seed I redeemed, "Kremling Kapture" find fiary camera and take pics of all 36 enemies. It sounds cool and fun but once you get the camera its just a rush and isnt that interresting. Still cool they made a mode out of it.
it just lacks depth, so after the 3rd time youve seen everything it has to offer
@Axl_SR sounds to me like stray fairy hunt in MMR p4ntzThink
except with MMR, you would then still need to figure out where your fairies are since you can shuffle them about and while the fountains tell ya where region wise, the list of things it can be depending on depth of shuffle can be steep
yeah, explore level looking for camera, then revisit those levels all over again
its a neat gimmick by sound
also there are some enemies that cant be shuffled like the books in the castle library
makes for more variety in RSL type stuff
yeah, the gimmick is really cool in concept
just needs to be tinkered with by sound to create interesting itempools out of it rly
it doesnt get much play tho so I cant see it getting much updates honestly
did I hear I should tell someone about that setting if they didnt already see it axl? KEKW
I know someone who loves silly settings
and it just so happens they also do like DK64
OOOOR you gently nudge keiper towards it tippiGiggle
sure why not, for me I knew it was a setting that ive seen no one do so I just wanted to see how it played
all just depends on if ya find ppl who want to play x setting to get x setting to maybe get updates
and IMO any and all settings you could create for shuffles is valid, as long as it creates solvable seeds
so "worst case" its RSL (random settings league) type stuff
im not invested enough to watch it again, but it would be cool to see keiper bring awareness to it. I doubt most of his community knows about it
well - you got the seed
that ball's in your park then tippiGiggle
no I dont have the seed, the genned it locally on their end, even had so experimental cosmetics
well... - still could ask for them to make ya a bps patch or send the lanky
my redeem was basically "i dont know what im doing, you pick the settings, i just wanna see a kremlinng kapture" LUL
you can just clip thru them?
he did a trick a bit ago with rusl to talk to him without his cutscene triggering
rusl and gorcoron share the same index or whatever for text, so doing that sets his text to let you into the mines
the wall is gone, but the gorons have not moved, so he just has to run behind them
having master sword early kind of screws up getting into goron mines
that trick save like 2 minutes?
alternatively you can also get in with spinner. it's kind of funny
there's an invisible wall there normally if you aren't able to clear the text but spinner is for some reason able to go through it
did an glitchless no S+Q speedrun and got a 6:29, it was a bad run but definitely improveable
OMG that is fantastic. The TP bugVirus hit ryan as well.
link where are you finding this oxygen
if your air meter is in the red when you do the last regrab it's over
it also depends on where she's going
dont let the bomb kill you
bro couldn't hold his breath for 2 more seconds
saw Hugo being rude earlier, annoying but I’m sure PB tomorrow Prayge
they can type pape or TP in chat to vote :P
or get on twitch in the next min or so
Mai, the only DMescque deck I'm running is Shining Sarcophagus
The other two decks is Sky Striker and Maliss
Which is more VRAINS era decks
I was just going to ask how much the plando redeem will be and lo and behold, I look and it already there KEKW
curious because you use a GC with raphnet, what do you use for input display and do you notice any issues?
oh wait I just saw in the panel what kind
Although the link 404’s now Sadge
yo I popped back in at the right time
been working on the plando and come back to a rando
I’m cold today. I was even cold at work.
nice, ty! been wanting to look into something for n64 input display
I need some warmth. I’m going to hide under my blankets lol
i freeze my ass off in my room way to cold over here
oh man just needing a new cable for a different console is nice then, you’re getting 2 in 1 for the package then
yeah my plando have only up to master 2 cuz fuck 3
Well what do we have here paperLuigi at last
im getting better, yesterday I finished a banjo seed without map tracker
I saw TP on youtube but clicked to find paper mario phanto274Thonk
You know it's gonna be a good seed when 5 minutes in you need to climb the mountain bootless
I never bother with this teleport
and just star oob the whole time
This is the first time i've noticed the flowey raid alert
because you can stay oob when you go over from the train tracks and than not need to do this
i collected all 8 pieces of bullshit
which is also the much easier way to do it without hammer
What is that then? It sounds exactly like flowey
we get to see rugged now
because getting your spin to cancel without hammer is just stupid
yeah that sounds like flowey's laugh from the beginning of undertale
oh rking boo? I thought it was fawful from the mario and luigi games lmao
doesn’t it match the raid alert icon? Hmm
@PeachedPocky It sounds nothing like fawful?
Goombario annoyingly open up dojo if you think about it
does goombario affect logic for dojo or is it just based on chapters cleared?
And just like that boots are gonna remain hidden for 2 hours
Why have so many zelda players been doing paper mario rando recently, and why only the 64 version from what ive seen?
Think they'll do the other Papers soon?
TTYD does have a rando but it sucks
I love seeing tricks in a game I have no fucking clue about
I'm asking you Kaiba, you and your new Blue Eyes support
God that yugioh alert may be my favourite thing on Twitch
plano is 100K ... Phantom why phanto274S
it pulls so many at good times
100K should make you play DK64R LUL
@Axl_SR i been cooking a plando for them
I need to resume cooking now that it's live on non-dev
so i went and looked it up bcuz i was curious
did yoy know that both flowey's laugh and king boos laugh were made by the same guy
from warner borthers, of all people
Gear Shuffle with Traps I see
I've played through both LM and undertale but I will probably always think of flowey when hearing that laugh
honestly I dont know anyone that doesnt run gear shuffle
@Axl_SR I've done a couple seeds with gearless start but since I play glitchless my boots are either always in a shop or in prologue
How many spheres were those, since we needed laki for goombario for parakarry, which led us here
Oh, I see start at Lvl 10 as well
Could you theoretically do volcano without boots or do you need them to skip the ultra block?
If for some ungodly reason you have ultra hammer before any boots it'd be beatable
So I've only just this weekend been exposed to the TTYD Tower of Trials
and in 3 simple steps, you ride the fish
@CaptainMD13 Tower of trials I found fun for 2-3 runs and then it becomes repetitive, watching bringle play it is good but actually playing it is boring
Well then you do like 2/3 of it in Danger Mario and win like a champ. Still can't believe you pulled that off
when people say TTYD randomizer do they mean the shufflizer?
@Axl_SR The only TTYD rando I've found only shuffles badges and items, to my knowledge the version bringle played isn't publicly available
that sounds like how the old pokemon randos work, doesnt really change up much
your still playing the same vanilla game
like how a battle network rando works too
A dream for me would be a TTYD HD rando, since it could have all the QOL changes of the remake with the changes of rando like fast text speed
that would require for people to use a delisted emulator, thats not gonna happen
I’ve only played it once but what would you say the biggest issue with the M&L one is?
@Axl_SR I can dream, even if realistically it will either never happen or it happens like 10 years from now when switch support dies
Oh man pro life start seems rough
also what does the switch version that the GCN version doesnt?
That is fair, I was surprised about that when I played
Seems like it would be better if it started in Castle town too
After playing PM64 rando it makes it hard for me to go back to regular paper mario since there's so many nice changes with the rando, especially cutscene and prologue skip
the peeps behind AP are not necessarily the most deep diving folks I think
most of the more indepth randos come from dedicated ppl / communities before AP picks them up
@Axl_SR Better fast travel pipes, partner wheel, better graphics(kinda), and fun things like some chapters having small things to make them faster like the creepy steeple pipe in chapter 4 or that spring in chapter 5
@yourfluffypalsam Not to mention Nerfed Hammer Throw, 1-frame 4th bounce, the list goes on
Can a single-player AP seed run on console?
all TTYDR needs rly imo is "get rid of the slow start with the tutorials
@CaptainMD13 Hammer throw was always garbage, but yeah the power bounce nerf sucks
like... to my knowledge not a single thing you get til the star map is got is lost in time for flag reasons
since you quite literally ONLY have map freestanding items
and if the concern is whether ppl search for the map? no
thats a starting item and thats it
emerald can run on console, banjo can run on N64 with the everdrive connector, but most dont @MarioManTAW
what even is the argument about prologue TTYD 🤣
not a SINGLE THING of that state is not gettable later
Phantom, you run LTTP on everdrive right?
boohoo, put the item in the bin
The real question is what takes longer, PM64 prologue or TTYD prologue? going off just getting to chapter 1
though isnt ttyd as much flag hell as pape64 is?
sooo just make it be in the bin then, given tattles exist in there already
That’s shorter than Pape 64 Clueless
just make it be a spawned item in there somewhere or a "press a to get" if frankly is too troublesome
and outside that, nothing else rly is prologue only
bigger problem is fixing the railroad chapters - so 4, 6 rly
chapter 3 ya could just set rank 5 on base imo
I was literally thinking the exact same thing
its its AP you can remove those from the pool
Why would you want to play the rando if it’s gated behind there too potentially
Just set it to the point after the Bowser fight
@Axl_SR not if you need the star
chapter reward still needs you to get to rank 1 past rawk
so item junking wouldnt solve that
best rly is if you can auto rank up to the actual mission bits then
Skip all the fights without logical item requirements, easy
Because for PM64 there's not only the whole peachs castle section but there's also 4 mandatory fights , and going through all of the prologue area, toad town, and star haven before finally getting to chapter 1
just force the easy fights enemy wise, but progress ranks accellerated to the actual bits of not fighting
I'M ASKING YOU KAIBA, YOU AND YOUR NEW BLUE EYES SUPPORT TAKING FOREVER FOR YOUR TURN
@Jonxhas I wonder if you could theoretically just cut all the fights besides the clefts and rawk hawk, then once you beat rawk hawk just have the door always be open to fight grubba instead of being forced to immediately fight him
oh I thought ch 3 was with doopliss
That's chapter 4, which could be SUPER shortened by just having the first doopliss fight be the only fight but only be able to fight him with the letter
TTYD rando desperately needs a project plan before starting
Like he just won't show up or the door leading to him doesn't open until you have the letter
Random P laying around the world somewhere
I feel at most ch 3 should only have 3 fights
oh riiight, Superstar saga is a bit stupid there
cus you need certain Beanbean castle states right?
Just cut all story elements and make some chapters take like 10 minutes KEKW
plus people would just blindly play TTYD AP "cause its the greatest mario RPG ever"
I'm not looking forward to having to buy 3 copies of the new DMG for my shining sarcophagus deck
All those Star Pieces for a cocnut
how many checks does the train have?
Still waiting for how they will censor the new DMG
@Axl_SR Easy fix: Just skip straight to riverside, then skip to smorg
@Axl_SR The Pot, the 3 missing Sticky Bomb items, 2 Memos
Since I'm actually playing the deck
there's a panel in the front of the train then one in the ghost room
I'm playing Shining Sarcophagus, Sky Striker and Maliss and I still need to finish construction on the three decks
yeah I knew about the one in the front of the train
Thankfully most of the expensive cards I got out of the way
riverside is the best part of chapter 6 in my opinion since it's the only part where you aren't spamming A and moving around for 15+ minutes
have you heard any updates on eldexterr, like what he is working on now?
I play Salamangreats. But I did enjoy the Earthbound Servant and Trickstar decks from the events
I also play a Zexal deck when I want to feel spicy
I will try to if I remember after I do the dishes
Lets think, about 2-3 minutes for PH, about 6-7 for riverside, give or take 4-5 minutes for smorg, so about 15-16 minutes of just mashing A
Question. If you use dark mode with bluesky does that make it blacksky?
I'm gonna play animal crossing on my other monitor while listening to this
@zeliversal Did you hear the set after Duelist Alliance is for Utopia
I have not. But I also don't worry about sets because I only play MD
I have been considering an @ Ignisiter deck for laughs tho
holy moly that is a long time
Duelist Advance has new Utopic Zexal support
Maliss and @Ignister have good synergy so I'm waiting for Duelist Alliance
Is there a way to skip needing her to reach general guy?
Is chapter 8 entrance shuffled with these settings?
How many castles do you own?
What's more annoying, the angle or the constant AAAAAAAA coming from the shy guys?
my long term goal is to try All Bosses so I would not be mad
also the ruins stone skip one too is nice
between that and PM archives I’m sure that will be lots
oh lmao well I’ll have to check when the time comes
generally, general guy is quite general. he lived and then he died, *checks word count* damn i need 10 pages
desert is so awful to clear bc of the invisible blocks
I feel like the enemy levelling was a little too steep when i played but it did force me to play smarter
yoo its paper luigi my favorite game
I find it easier to get high tidal wave damage by using a GC controller on wii VC
just watched your ruins stone skip video
dude just 48k more til VIP lol
I’d love to see more about the all bosses routing
Better than fighting a shy guy for one
No need to glitch into chapter 2 boss fight arena
one mpre shot to block it!
Is it just when the stars stop? I always forget the timing
Time to full clear this place out
it was the MJ of swoops
I think I finally trained myself not to lol
that and the bucket one putting that on the way back
Koopa Bros might be the only easy one
i need a bowsers big bean burrito to satiate my hunger
its from dunkey's mario maker video where he held the world record on a level named bowsers big bean burrito
For me I want meatloaf for some reason
especially if you like glaze the outside in brown sugar
i mean. you can exclude ketchup but yeah
maybe you could turn it into a sandwich
put breads on the sides as the side
i want the baby back ribs i had in Page
I wonder if anyone makes like a meatloaf tin thats like sausage sized, so I could cut meatloaf to use on crackers
true but I can't eat sausage
Maybe a sweet chili glaze but ketchup glaze is all right
god i loved the pf changs spicy glaze
tubbas been eating cheeto puffs again
I hope somebody makes a mod that replaces tubba with kool aid man
he would burst through the wall right there
get him a club he’s so small
this is the area that punked me
oh my god its a flying cheep cheep
well now I know one check ive been missing
Funny the Laki power up before the laki dungeon
the best i can do is a life shroom
so you did skip Koopa Bros lol
oh wait right it could be tutankoopa
We're looking for WD40 for Russ T
Don't enjoy this theme for long
Tell me you do hurricane route without telling me you do hurricane route
I was a lil late daurn't mind me
Ohh Phantom I had a smashed whiskey earlier for din din
FROZEN WHISKEY SMASH Maker’s Mark, Mathilde Pêche liqueur, lemon juice, mint syrup
omg I meant with dinner LUL
I had a 12 oz ribeye steak medium smothered in grilled onions and mushrooms with buttered mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots
I mean first time you're in Houston
That meal is just too rich for my blood
I go to this place once a year LUL
My meals are like here take these lap cheung sausages and rice and that's it with an egg
With how pricey eggs have gotten adding just an egg seems like a luxury item now
the one time I count myself lucky I can't eat eggs
Lap cheung fried rice with eggs is a decent cheap fried rice
Probably with a sweeter soy sauce
I used to make Spam and eggs ALL the time but of course I was migraine boy all the time
I'd just only go with green beans for fried rice
The rest of the veggies seems out of balance with fried rice
Not to mention how wet the frozen veggies are which could ruin the fried rice
I think I was calculating that eggs were like 40% cheaper here even taking the dollar into account and I was shook
I saw how much they were selling them in places like Mexico and it was like a few dollars a dozen
I meant to check local markets egg pricing
Eggs are 7 something a dozen where I live and 12 dollars after the first 2
I don't need them that bad
I had to look and eggs are like 5-7 $CAD and a local grocery store for a dozen
yup like 3.50-5 I think around there USD
I miss when an 18 count was 2.50
love to star storm on final
why you do me like that
ok cool the plando page auto save
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
my lawyer has advised I'm not allowed to say "OR ELSE" anymore
awsm sub 330. Hope u have a great rest of day or night.
Listen, my bathroom sink is due for a drain clean too and that shit sucks
Long hair sucks for that, didn't realize how bad it could get until I moved in with my wife
Lets gooo and good luck buddy
Yeah I have that problem too
My beard is that long i know what problem it is 😅🤣
How's one of my favorite streamers doing?
Which glitch is the hardest to do? The only one I can think of is lakebed boss
Well no I don't mean morpheel itself
I meant the boss key skip

The little tip tail shake while walking
Can I send you a tutorial on Iza bomb duping? PauseChamp
I’ve never made a tutorial so I lowkey want to try KEKW
@Midnaliin tutorials are fun to make until you release them
and then people either dont even listen to them at all and then say it was bad or they ask you 50 questions that was in the video
On a scale of Sunny to Night, what is your princess?
can't wait to see it in a couple minutes EZ
I got word today that my AGDQ '25 Coin is on its way.
I didn't think it would be the goats NOOO
It's 40something outside and my windows are open, it ain't cold enough in here
Once you discover the joy of having house be 45 degrees and you're covered by every blanket you own, you'll understand.
@DreamcatcherSky instructions unclear; i rotated my house and the blankets aren't helping with the now rotated floor
yea I just mean the JA was a little early I think
why do i always tune into bugs
i mean yeah it is like 19 minutes into the run and relies on a finicky ai-controlled entity moving near a wall that can and will troll you
it's so unlikely but yeah i've seen some horrible ones
always a 50% chance for her to stop after the first 3 stops
so in theory she can go on forever...
I wonder if anyone has timed it
maybe you could ask the tp discord
Phantom I regret to inform you that meal I had last night wreckt my stomach Deadge
yeah I was so sad and in pain LUL
im currently simulating 10,000 gohma fights to see how many holes minimum and maximum we get
I remade gohmas movement and light behavior
wanted it to be as accurate as possible lol
was more just fucking around and having fun
cuz flipping a coin isn't fun
the bad movements are baked in cuz it actually is moving around like gohma and picking holes like gohma
so far I've found if gohma picks holes horizontally and vertically it results in more holes
than if it chooses diagonal twice
you can get 3 holes only with 2 diagonals
you can get up to 6 before the 200-300 timer ends
and I think thats where allot of the bad rng comes to play
the interesting thing to me is technically it means you aren't losing any time
if you get 6 fast holes
cuz the timer was in place anyway
on average gohma should travel 3 holes before 200 frames
cuz it typically will pick a bad light and do a 360
im just watching like 100 gohmas run around
you have to wait for 4?
also what do you think about the bomb strat
I found you can use a bomb to speed him up with ordon sword
like you walk over with a bomb pulled and drop it behind him
i started doing it for rando
GL with your consistency, I lost all of mine on wall jumps in Zero Mission
Had been up to today where I'm too frustrated and angry at being unable to wall jump for freaking acid worm
Like, from decent consistent to completely unable, 0% consistency
And having to do a roundabout strat that easily loses 10 seconds minimum and makes it WAY harder.
Yeah I've been struggling with wall jumps from left walls for like half the month, I just can't nail them
Again, was actually doing them just fine last month.
a former coworker just told me they might've referred to me as "work husband" on occasion
I assume it has to do with game state stuff.
and i i missed th whole explanation because of adds
and presumably you have to dodge the cutscene trigger to get that text
closing in on sub 4 sum of best.
I can't believe midnas fucking dead
But also she's sick in the rad way
is this the best ladder in any zelda game ever?
This isn't as bad as climbing to the top after uhhh
But that also is not a ladder
He's so camp I love it for him
if you go fast then you are going fast!
is the only diffrence between this and vanilla intended dungeon order just that you do snowpeak early
yo! soy dora! can you find the jolteon? glennj5WAVE
It's very considerate that the main chamber one just watches you do shit
Will you try some BC runs at some point?
But what about before the year 0?
Temple of Time do be a thing
Time for big ol fucking 😳
this game of breakout is crazy
I love when I make a code change that should have no impact but somehow it does
And I don't know why, but the end result is more desirable so
So I think legally I'm obligated to shut up and take it
It will if you say it will
Me. I'm where it falls apart
But it's THE Greg of all time
i spent the next several hours hunting for kinstone fusions and getting a bunch of rewards
i got big bomb bag, bigger quiver, got the two godesses moved into houses, got the flippers, and placed myself at the begining of the next dungeon  before calling it
and made it for best dungeon
just a cool 18 min timesave 🕶️
when the cheating is good and fair
It was good but I failed the thing I was going to make a tutorial for
what are you making a tutorial for mid
ah i can help with that
I've only been getting like 30 secs at a time sometimes for channels that run 3 mins
Yeah, I've heard that ad inventory gets kinda slim this time of the year
you're only like 26 min behind a 3:39 rn
you're 18 min behind a 3:39
yo Z you're like 18 min behind your bed time go the fuck to sleep
No its an all nighter tonight, I woke up 6pm and have a 9am lecture
Im improving that's the first time ive gone nocturnal in like 2 or 3 weeks
2 isn't too many, you'll be fine FeelsOkayMan
Its like maths 1 but even more shit
I love zant he's such a useless little twink
that is generally what enemies try to do Phantom
Cats do seem to exclusively tread on your balls for no reason
If you pb I will drink cat shit
I'll drink my orange soda ty
if your cat's shit is drinkable it may need to go to the vet
And it is indeed cat shit
Splash is abt to have a 4loko
Personally here in Mexico it's the cheapest to get wasted sooo
I stopped watching for a bit to continue my casual playthrough of this and just did the first half of this dungeon and in that time you did all of ToT CitS and most of this
It's different casually from a speedrun scenario
why are you good at video games phantom its cheating to be good at video games
me when I see good Celeste players
zant untwinked himself for a second
just cause you get to be a giant does not untwinkify you
that probs doesnt hold up in court
I should ask my Attorney Online group
Anyways off to the next one
flaring is judging me rn i dont like it
cyndaquil is going through a trip rn
Meh enough leniency to a 9 cycle zelda
Unless you find another way to fuck up a run
I mean the body could be made out of enchanted piss.....
link that lip gloss looks fire
Why would you keep playing at that point brother
Might as well go to bed
Nothing better than the squidna scene
the speedrun gods: aw hell yes time for hubris
you missed something yellow back there
i say put 1000000000 dollars on it rn
I got one cornchip on plus 4
thats what link's crossbow training was for
then where would the creators of the game get their just due then?
will you guinea pig my route NiceSoftlock
it's done but i think i'm missing a letter somewhere for a star piece lol
yo amish ty for the gl
yo Lopez ty for the gl
can I redeem a long run towards Lopez's redeem to make it on the list
im gonna redeem pokepark true hundo
with the power of editing it is
when would you want to test it lol i can have it done by thursday earliest
You gonna go for sub 4?
Don't stress about ib times too much
Credits are so good in this game
I love games like these with afterscene credits of the unfolding peace
Funny thing is right now I'm recording my wants list for Yu-Gi-Oh cards I want to buy in which rarities and sets
Just need to record which rarity Sky Striker stuff I want
I know I want an alt art Engage
just voting for the magic thing cuz i have no idea what it is
is it  magic pengel the quest for color?
ahh i see since its losing gonna check it out
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
iwa mt rugged... well iwa does mean stone
and mt rugged is the most rocky area LUL
do you have any ray tracks?
is this just gonna be a coding stream?
I would expect this kind of stream on the alt
did you see icebound's follow up message
Phantom do you have an alt that I'm not following
@Axl_SR less than half that cause like the first 10 min was waiting room.
if they do one would they do the other?
would recommend clarifying on the glitch list page
Forgot what stream I was in for a sec
i was supposed to be doing stuff like 3 hours ago but i got voluntold into going up towen to help my grandma w her smart tv
what kinda tracker stuff do you have in mind?
ngl for a second i thought i had a window in front of the stream lol
I'd have to see which room it is does it have any interesting aspects to the room
Yooo you are also doing of the coding PogBones
quake hammer room maybe then idfk
Ok Phantom, I have a small problem and I think we should go in on this together
Did you see the Framework desktop yesterday?
Do you know framework at all or no?
Framework is a company that started with laptop manufacturing. Their laptops are designed to be completely modular and upgradable. Every year you could just buy a new motherboard, swap them out with just a screwdriver, and reuse the same display, etc. Or if your display breaks or you want a higher res, but a new one and replace, etc.
so basically a desktop but in a laptop shell that's neat
They just announced a new 'desktop' which is actually the new AMD AI laptop chips, but with standard desktop power/IO headers. So basically a Mac studio but AMD and more replaceable and better, and significantly less expensive
And I want one... 5GHz cores with DDR5 with insane memory bandwidth for just 120W/140 boost? Uhm yes please
The top spec is 128GB, 16-cores, with the integrated radeon (but it has full access to the DDR5 for LLMs or otherwise, and seems to match a 4060 in gaming), with the case and power supply, for $2000
Also standard M2 drives for storage
You can buy the motherboard (so the CPU, GPU, and RAM) separate and bring your own PSU too
Anyway. If you could just split one with me, that'd be great YEP Mondo's refusing to give me an advance on my salary
no tas level tricks that need to make it in?
I wonder how many new tricks you can do with full entrance rando, like theoretically you could sushie glitch everywhere with it right?
what do you need to change?
whats going on how are you doing
i bought two of those JP white controllers for less than 120usd
The island where the Huskies are extra loud and the Shibas scream
Can I just acknowledge this is a bop
Are you implementing all glitch logic in your tracker now?
ooh emo update for s4? :D
Ultra Boots don't get you GR right?
It probably hasn't been reported bc it's hard to get there w/o hammer
hit the sub 2 on racetime
god I love tryna figure out discrepancies with data I didn't create. I have 2 different sources and they aren't lining up when it should be the exact same data and I have to figure out which is accurate lol.
whenever i look at code like this i realize i am truly a filthy ruby dev
having an intense reaction to 4 space tabs
my eyes don't bleed which is a lot better than C languages or Java or Python
daughter of the dark god jump scare
Holy balls it’s a Phantom stream LETSGO
Just do this next time you need to enter that room :)
I am still deconstructing my previous b3313 notes atm
down to like 150 lines not fully brought in right
slowly getting there though which is neat
Reference video had input display, didn't it?
This soundtrack is a banger pepeJAM
Unrelated, but did you ever learn the Snowman Skip with Laki?
I mean it is this room what do you expect
what tricks have you been messing around with?
why can't it be accounted for?
ER wouldn't mess that up more than any other LZS trick, right?
I was curious how far you can make it in the ruins jump less as it should now be possible to make it there without them
oh god yeah entrance rando with LZS would be stupid
Hypothetically, ER+LZS is pretty incompatible yeah
cause yeah you could get so many different angles
yeah that's what I thought just wasn't sure if there was even more clippy shenanigans you could do
if sushie glitch ER is disabled then yeah LZS ER would prolly be like 100x harder to implement.
Imagine using Clippy for a Laki-less trick
I mean can't you make it jumpless if you can raise the sand or am I wrong about that
it should be possible to full clear mt rugged thoug
You need Super Boots for LTR, does RTL even require Boots?
Naming is still definitely one of the 4 horsemen of programming. Wonderful seeing people doing the hard work for us rando enjoyers!
Looks like base logic for RTL is Super Boots or Laki
would right to left be out of logic if entrance rando was on if you just disabled all LZS
even though it doesn't need LZS
I believe the return logic should only ever matter with ER anyway so idk
sushie glitch is also something that entrance rando would change a lot
yeah I think unlike LZS it would be possible to write logic for it but also it would be a complete pain and take up a lot of time so prob not worth
Write logic for Anti Guy skip and also for just fighting Anti Guy YEP
I think I have used a lemon candy a total of once and that is simply because one natually spawned for me and so I was like why not
Yes made it in time from my biking. So what u cracking?
would this also let you go from the left entrance to the right one jumpless if you had entrance rando on?
think there was a 2nd jumpless laki strat in prologue that was posted at the same time as that one
Okay well it took me a while but I finally figured out why the data discrepancy exists, now I just gotta figure out what I'm going to do about it lol.
So will the logic only be from the left?
lets you get the coins as well as the fire flower
Did confirm the TP works from the left, does the new logic also allow skipping the block coming from the left?
yeah the rest besides the jank first attack stuff but those require being high enough level
has jumpless attack fx C been added
was just browsing the strat channel
time for me to find 10 more jumpless strats in the next hour Kappa
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Damn...gotta be quicker than that lol
@AnniLyn2 sorry was busy slaying a monster lol
Omg I thought your hair got longer...didn't think it was a cloth lolz
Anyone know how to properly fold a fitted sheet?
Is audible on stream, similar to your volume
No chat on stream is intended or?
why is the category called 101%?
2 chill voices and pape music. Lovely
does that mean tts will be more enjoyable for you
I'd have to wait though I need like an hour or 2 into the vod when people are asleep kazamsCatglubhappy
I see the badge on people
its all can see the badges
I just see the diff badge
i can time out Raven KEKW
@blacktiger51 did you actually do it?? Lul
@RavenFP cuz you send that from lopez chat so the button is there KEKW
Temporary caffeine if you choose the right one
Are you guys racing each other?
Me very carefully watching this run so I know which are the fastest Star Pieces to collect for my challenge runs: NOTED HmmNotes
You know...why not lolz imma watch both just because lolz
while the dog is my fave character in mansion it seems u need to do updates.
Soda isn't helping! You two are too chill evo17Flip
Nah I'm just sassing. Maybe I should finally test coffee
What the hell is that emote, keklmao, dog dog ffzX dog
evo17Hiyo evo17Heart evo17KO evo17Banzai evo17Flip evo17Wut my favorite ones lolz
ok i guess you don't have a command for that
so how do you know what the questions are?
I'm not even gonna fix that..
Since López isn't watching, united sucks ass
Barcelona is the real deal with Madrid next anywho
Those fucking professional divers who are divas?
I expected you to have some taste stavros
nah my real team is La Galaxy and Olympiakos and Paok.
Don't tell me you root for galaxy just because giroud is there
ive been a galaxy fan since 2 yrs before we got Beckham. James Donovan is like my fave player ever next to the greek greats which i refuse to spell names
@jokehow I don't get the joke
bro is not doing mailman skip
I’m here. doesn’t look like I’m too late
how many times do you hit him
bro is just building up his counter
1 hr party of race and no winners
have you ever forgotten something deep into a run before
Lmao at Phantom's announcement resulting in a big ass emote on Blopez' channel france16Kekw ads
that doesn't kill you right if you're at 1hp
Man it'd probably kill you if it did
i always forget this is a real category now and not just a joke, gl
double it and pass it to the next person
Lopez you apparently you have an echo
On Phans stream...my iPad died but lemme see
I wouldn't want you to mess up your race just because of an echo on one side but not yours. Rain seems to have sensitive ears
there's only 5 ultrashrooms in JP so you have to make sure on JP to use some of them for recipe combinations
Gold oinks don't drop ultrashroom on JP
time to chain quizmo in koopa village west
im titled so im here to chill
100% requires all 50 recipes, 160 Star Pieces, 64 Quizmo quizzes, 80 badges, 16 Super Blocks, 7 Star Spirit Cards, All 4 permanent Key Items, All 4 boot and hammer upgrades. The extra 1% comes from defeating all bosses and minibosses.
hard to remember which recipe combination you made in this game since there's no recipe screen from the menu
keep the golds and inflate your sob
2 hrs of solidness and no winner yet. Busy cooking dinner
my pb is on the first route made still OMEGALUL
i dont remember the logistics of this run, how are we on quizmo rng
all you can really hope for in a race i guess lol
how does bro know what the answer is
is it just ch4 that has spooks in this run, i forget
Money can't solve all your problems, but this one it can
I see you have a ton of games under your belt, which would you say are a favorite or 2?
Good luck to only phantom phanto274Mash
Any tips for someone who can't guard Bowser's star rod attack? I honestly would run this game so often if I could just consistently get it
Oh dip it's Morpheus too! poggers
yo fancyfish! i remember your name, you tried doing any% for this game awhile ago right? hope all is good
Felt. the zoom out is so hard to understand lol. If only you didn't have to start at the beginning every time. Hardware issue I suppose lol
@morpheus080 Yessir! Still never beat a run because of Bowser, but I remember you complimenting my Flower Fields skip for being a noob lol
All is good man. I hope all is the same with you! Planning on getting back into speedrunning so I'm glad to see Phantom on playing this banger
Also, I play with N64 attached to my monitor through all the fun cords. Idk if that is problematic, but I only really have issues with Bow Wow Wave
Then it's just practice... Sadge lol
I'd rather practice BHS than that fight lol
What's the big difference in this route that allows such time save?
We love a good Recipe reroute
alu is also streaming art as well
I gotta make sure to keep doing that donation thing to get my VIP points lol
@Shadowcire Be patient about it ur an awsm chatter.
@Shadowcire and an awesome person shiiiSmile
What's your favorite and least favorite chapter for 100%? Something tells me Flower Fields is rough lol
i thought you were doing tp glundo ngl
jess you should have joined this race
4 hrs of greatness and no winner yet
Paper Mario is the best vibe idc what anyone says
i'm assuming hundo doesn't require max level
is there partner upgrades in this game? I forget
well that's good! glad you guys aren't regretting this choice yet haha
gl monadoBless I hope it continues to go well
I don't even wanna know how you begin to re-route for a category like this
bro is making popcorn right next to the mic
all my homies hate that clubba
Race may have just been decided
I was just about to ask LUL
you feel like grinding this cat? haha
looks like the King blessed the race 1st try!
so you're running it back after this right Chatting
how do you remember which option to choose
dude I can't tell if you're baiting lmao
yall should do a rando 100% race :P
is max level part of 100%ing? lol
you must like talking to this guy
can you activate the sfx badges pls
I'm getting ads in Spanish, does twitch know about me monkaS
I wish tp had this game's text
then in ttyd they made you mash again
I wish I could enjoy some spm content. Its so lame how Zach link and castle are such selective gamers they cringe kill tricks and fights. But oh well.
no not drama just when i show up even lurking they end stream or never finish runs,
that still put him to sleep lmfao
Hii Phantom, how are you doing today? phanto274Wave str9ngLove
are we in the home stretch
i'm guessing there's 2 badges here
i think you have two audio sources for your friend
active. but i understand ur in the middle of a run lol
ive never seen that i dont think lol
did that always do 12 in the older routes lmfao
it did in fact do 11
it's been almost 4yrs since i ran this
Oh man the Sushie tech so they don't throw bones, that's Pog
Here we go! It comes down to this all!
gotta wait for peach to put her hands up
oh yeah this not rando KEKW
when I did all cards in 2015 I remember fucking hating bowser

Brian I didn't want you Sadge
already beat the new monster hunter game
i get 120hz and 60 fps on ps5
my friends crash alot on pc
my friend get 40fps on a 2070 super
damn yeah i hate anything on pc
the ps5 version have 0 issues
i'm glad to be here at the beginning i always miss the very start
just tell steam its broken and doesn't work anymore
i got a refund for a game i played for like 10 hours
well there is a quest board but that end game KEKW
Hey I just finished a MSR lolz
How long do you think this'll take?
No reset after Hugo until you lose to Jamal lol
Are you holding the reset combo during the load zone?
Ohh the controller doesn’t work I see
Sorry I wasn’t fully paying attention KEKW
Might as well prepare first yeah?
Claw on Y good job NODDERS
I usually put claw on X and arrows on Y
Wish I could throw out quick spins like that
Yeah I’ve never seen that before
I can convert to t1 when I get into a job
Idk if it’s helpful but instead of back flipping I target walk and I find it pretty consistent
That may be a good alternative if the camera fucks up
Because it’s not a run ofc lol
Yoy! Again to everyone here and I just got up from a short nap to refresh myself
That is so real when I lived with 5 roommates I always had to clean a mountain of dishes just to make a meal
then the same person who left it would start to like invade the kitchen as I was cooking. so I always just ended up eating fast food lol
Did you talk to them about it? I wonder if changes could be made or are they just not listening
nah i just got one person to blame if my place gets dirty at all LUL
yeah small sink and no dishwasher for me. if i get lazy for one day it's game over
Yeah you just can’t be lazy with roommates though that’s just inconsiderate. although sometimes I feel like some roommates expect things to be clean a certain way and that’s annoying on the other end of the spectrum KEKW
Okay so we know the culprit is the basement dweller smh
Okay for me that shit gets so messy LMAO like I’m dropping sauce and noodles. but I will wipe it down (especially if you have roommates like you just can’t)
I just came back I HATE that
Well okay no I can't clean anything that would have grease like immediately because hot stove
Gas is still pretty hot though I thought
Oh I thought you guys meant the one with eyes
Ohh yeah true but if it’s right beside the burner it’s a little sus
We use to clean off the eyes and replace the foil...people think it's dangerous though
"You really shouldn't take that out. What if you don't put it back right and break it??"
LetThemCook is an emote i feel like should be around, i did find one on 7tv lol
I feel like I know what you're talking about but I might be wrong
I do that to dishes to check if they're clean
Isn't marble like...black and grayish too?
i wish i had nicer looking counters but they are at least super easy to keep clean
i hate everything in my apartment but i do like the $400 rent so phanto274Shrug
Yeah you just get jumpscared by all the gross messes left on it
Sorry I pinged you what I think you mean...I originally thought that was marble lolz
i have a like, 700sq ft garage apartment that is so meh, but not having to live in a complex is pretty nice
yeah, my coworkers mom was looking for someone to rent it and i was like HeyGuys
like anytime i have complaints it's so hard to not be like "well it's only $400"
Especially when you accidentally touch the worst part
like it's not rundown and it's remodeled so i shouldn't complain
Today honestly feels so restless. I can’t decide if I want to run any%, AD, nap or be productive KEKW
All of the above- at the same time
man this fight looks like trash lol
Just skip it next time Clueless
Would you say Stahlord is the worst boss of TP
confirmed learning this skip when i learn this game Kappa
Yeah being made to fight on the spinner for phase one with the RNG spawns make it bad
it's a cool fight in theory but i always hated that phase 1 even casually
Kind of a shame too, since I really like stalord in casual fights
There should be a joke TP romhack where every boss is replaced by Stahlord
When you look at it...all shard bosses suck in their own way
that fight seems really satisfying to do well
When stahlord is a worse boss than the phases of Ganondork
You take that back gamer lolz
Okay I ordered pizza life is very good NODDERS
I still find that really cool
Rain made a lot of gumbo and I ate too much
Why are you trying to turn link into minced meat monkaS
#FanningRoom I do believe the dev miscalculated the extension
Didn't have to throw your broken armor at link
Gotta admit...argorok has some pretty impressive scales
You got it this go around
Bobby is on the way with my pizza pie LETSGO
Yeah that’s what I ordered dominos is so good KEKW
gl on all major skips o/
do you know if there's a way to change the font on the 100% tracker
i tested one of my new controllers i ordered, what would have been ess on my main controller rn was 35 on the new one lol
i knew my controller was weird for ess but man OMEGALUL
my main controller has a smash 4 white board
that might be a shell issue
oh yeah i press in the middle
i use my black smash controller for just fighting odolwa cuz quick spinning feels better on that controller
otherwise it feels pretty bad for MM
it def has less use than my MM controller, even with all of the ult in played in 2019
i've only used oem for all of these games so i usually at least try them to see what happens
my s4 controller is funny in that 90% of the time, it holds down the X button upon plugging it in, even after cleaning it lol
is it me or m drunken eyes but i morph pink again?
nah im still purple stavros FeelsOkayMan
Im finally free of Kyurem and Unova hell
aside from wanting a back up, i'd prefer to keep my MM controller for just MM so that's mainly why im hoarding jp whites now baseg
id like to get tongued by it KEKW OMEGALUL
I remember a long time ago I had a very weird smash 4 controller
in some games it worked prefectly fine
but in others holding L + R together just disabled all analog inputs so I couldn't use the stick or c-stick
in prime 1 it worked fine
we'll figure out how to defeat fyrus next time Sadge
i died to fyrus lmaooooo and then had one of the worst skull kids in a different run
you gotta for further left with the roll
but i had a good time, got some golds
I don't really struggle with the bomb boost much
sometimes I think the boomerang hits the bomb so I just lose time to having to wait longer for it to blow up
oh yea this room sucks in ad right
On a scale of peasant to queen, what is your twilight?
@Zeliversal i need lots of em
Nope. Literally no one needs mirror
Tell your computer that's a skill issue
only if you had the ps5 version Sadge
Just get a small rig just for streaming since everything would be through the capture card anyway
And then if you leave the computers alone long enough, you might find a raspberry pi one morning
EPona truly is the worst boss
what does JotWaS even stand for
180s like that should be illegal
do you know how to access the twitch highlighter even if you're over the storage limit?
I remember seeing a post about it but idr what the link is
guess i'll start on that then lmao
youtube won't allow me to upload my glundo run so i want to highlight it lmfao
filesize is just too big OMEGALUL
i can't record glundo in 4k with the settings i use so i'll just go back to 1080p
i didnt either but it's 256 gb or 12 hours, whatever comes first
The maximum file size you can upload is 256 GB or 12 hours, whichever is less. We've changed the limits on uploads in the past, so you may see older videos that are longer than 12 hours.
no date or anything, and no sign of verification meaning anything besides the basic verification letting you upload over 15 mins
new controller sound like hype to me
I'll see if I can get verified on yt and see if it will let me upload after lol
PHANTOM HOW DO YOU BE ENTERTAINING TO PEOPLE idk good luck btw
You were just doing a wii u version cosplay
we can play ww rando on it :)
just dunno about the hdmi port
sooo this route doesnt get sling? p4ntzThink
how is the new controller treating you
so its kind of like driving a new car
Why not do all of them?
if you are a dog it is
i mean ig you could use them as drums too if you're not.
Thank you for kitty climb help NODDERS
Yeah still waiting on the invite Madge
Yes I came into a Nancy spared valid run. GL on New controller run!
During my AD run I didn’t even know you could take the spiders out with the rang KEKW I was like no way I need Nancy RNG twice
Yeah I think that would def save time
if i redeem a plando seed, that includes undermiser too right Clueless
@Feli_Heli sure why the heck not LuL
you should play mm casually at some point fishShy
Did you try the cue I sent you? PauseChamp
Darn Got pillared and wetted out.
You know BITE it’ll be fine lol
Ohh that’s right the failed tutorial KEKW
is the game being enbyphobic today
Not a fan of someone glitching lolz
so is there a race going on?
I do love me some Prime
it's in my top 5 games of all time, which is Something given I don't play any other FPS
i got to the final boss of prime 1 and couldn't beat it
I'm waitin for the other two to drop tbh
I'm with ch0msky that gamecube > wii, despite the aiming being better
Do you want to know about missable scans?
I know of many of them off the top of my head
The only truly bastard scans are in Phendrana outside of Chozo Ruins tbh
oh TIL (or well yesterday technically) that the composer for the Bravely Default games also did most of the OPs for Attack on Titan :O
I was for SURE IE died
I think IE died with Win 11
Or at the very least it's not on my computer by default.
a very disrespectful death it died, as was warranted unfortunately despite its history growin up o7
it's hilarious cause I know precisely you are on the menu screen
When I was on windows I used to use a tool called sizer for this
Greatest emulator, missing a basic tool
Yeah, used to have the same issue back when I was streaming speedruns to twitch. Sizer was my solution, although I'm somewhat suprised neither dolphin nor windows native have something like it
I just gave up and full screened it tbh
but I have the monitor space to afford it
I mean windows native I kinda get cause it's kinda a basic thing lol. Most programs either aspect ratio is irrelevant or they have that built in.
gods I feel so old THIS GAME CAME OUT IN 2002
How much for Other M retro-cheevos? :P
How much to cancel out whatever Darkness wants to slap down to play Other M?
Yeah I've actually heard the gameplay is solid
I think I've never asked this: Which Metroid games have you played?
Oh damn I missed the dungeons before I could say hello
Gotcha, so this is both a RA runthrough and a casual first time beating the game then?
lemme see... Thermal Visor to Charge beam is sequence breaking
Are you going to be starting to play some of the GC games again?
Space Jump prior to boost ball is sequence but it's relatively simple if you're on 1.0.0
oh some of these achievements are *evil*
never done them on purpose I dont' think
Hard mode in Metroid Prime games is stupid. It ain't worth it, chief
hot take but the worst of Hard Mode is Omega Pirate
It's just "missiles upgrade give +2 instead of +5, everything hurts for 2x - 4x damage, your damage output is halved"
I think so, don't nail me to that part tho
The other scaling is roughly correct I'm sre
I enjoyed Prime, wouldn't put it in my favorite games ever list tho. It's def in some peoples tho.
audio sounds good vs you for now
seems fine but it's hard to tell just off the menu.
I think it's just the menu theme is quiet.
This game gets kinda loud in the first part at least
once you're outta the frigate it'll quiet down a bit
I've tried getting into the prime randos a few times. Found out I vastly more enjoy watching them played than playing myself tho
yeah prime randos are fun to watch.
I wanna try rando sometime, this game was a Special Interest ™️ for a time
this game is just a beauty!
even all this time later it still looks faboo
this coming out on Gamecube was criminal
The remaster even looks better and I thought that was gonna be impossible
I got the remake I still need to play this
Oh that's good to hear, this is one of the ones I missed on GC
Depends. The artifact hunt is endgame. Finding the artifact temple is like the first thing you do on the planet
standard of the prime series at least, maybe Super Metroid as well
It's 'hard locked' to force endgame, in that you need pretty much all of the non-optional upgrades to get there
you can sequence break this game pretty heavily tho
personally I was never a huge fan of the look and aim being separate but ig it has its benefits.
Trilogy/Wii controls handled that better, but it specifically handles tighter on the Gamecube
I mean that's basically the game, right? Scan Everything ™️
I think there's also a kbm mod for prime 1, not sure if it works with RA though
Well I like 2 more but I still love this game
but it's also the harder game considerably
I agree on 2 being superior
2 has 3 major improvements to it: Screw Attack, shooting while Grapple Beaming, and underwater navigation improvements
also it has my fave suit
idk why but I never minded the tank controls in this game ig you're nimble enough that it's never really a major issue unlike some games where turning a corner feels like the worlds most impossible challenge *cough*RE*cough*
how much to redeem a casual playthrough of 2
I think u posted to Jcog's
I never played Prime 3 how is it considered compared to the other 2?
Prime 3 is ... uh, different
I wanted to like it better despite its better controls
Prime 3 is more Halo then Metroid at times
It's very linear and more focused on story
which isn't a *bad* thing, but I liked Prime and 2 for its environmental storytelling and the feeling of loneliness
which, parts of 3 still get it, but it was still obnoxious
also 3 fed you where all the upgrades and expansions were, which I would like as an option, but not forced
as someone who played a bunch of RPGs recently I miss playing games that don't have 20 minutes of dialogue in the middle of a "timed" section.
I hate it when that happens
me when I try and get out of bed
That's why you don't cheap out on the suit that loses all it's abilities when you get knocked into a wall once... Samus.
it's basically how any metroid game starts
Well you either get the "oh no lost my gear again" cop-out, or just no explanation at all
Oh for a sec I thought that was another suit function that got lost LUL not tracking on Ridley.
It's like Zelda, these are all different Samuses
I get it, you want the people to gather up shit, but please
it may need a bit of boosting now that you're outta the frigate
You can look a bit down using R, then hold L and let go of R to get a better visual of the edge for a jump
that's the premise of Strafe Jumping or whatever it's called right
fuck yeah it sure do different thing
remember c definitely doesn't stand for camera, why would it ever be used for controlling that. That's just stupid.
it's a bit tricky to navigate at first but I do like how it stacks, it was a good translation from Super Metroid
With prime's map I sometimes run into an optical illusion where the map looks weirdly inverted / upside down
the ambience of the ruins before you get Morph Ball >
You're coming up on a rough scan by the by
Meanwhile Samus gets eaten alive reading all the lore.
the wasps for both Missiles and Morph Ball Bombs are different than the ones you have scanned and are missable
as well as the contraption that holds the missiles
you'll wanna scan in the water
not going to rule it out just yet
For this fight I usually just stare at the radar the whole time
This one is just bad and unfair in general
like why would you have to scan the *water* to get it
More options than 90% of nintendo games
you should be able to wtf
gods remaster glowed this room the fuck up
that was prime real estate. poor wasps
How do insure against a murderous space bounty hunter
everyone in chat: p r i m e
the internal name for blastcap is "chubb weed"
and for reaper vine it's "spank weed"
you are now cursed with this knowledge
one of things the sequel does better
there the drops for stuff you're missing have a vastly higher chance
the drops in this game are very strange
yeah mp1 has lower drops by far
specific rooms have set rates for drops. it's odd
drops for power bombs especially suck
meanwhile prime 2 is like "wait what if we made drops make sense"
you have a few options available ye
yeah this game doesn't care about what you currently have
some enemies can only drop certain things, and it's not universal per enemy
It's weird yeah, only certain rooms drop power bombs
which sucks for getting to the final boss as it stands
like, there are some crates that have 100% chance for missiles
the drops in this game are needlessly complicated, tl;dr
You can turn the nagging hint system off I think
it's worse in remaster I think lmao
I love me some optional hint systems tbh
I grew up on SMB3 and Sonic 2, then Pokemon
but I got a 64 and went from there
most of the games I played as a kid were 3D so I'm used to that a lot more than 2D lol
'this fucking room', all prime players say in unison about the arborium
I played Super Mario 64 so at the very least I adjusted therer
I grew up with 3d games
first game I ever played was sm64
I was born the same year the n64 came out what can I say
I was 2 when I started gamin myself
honestly I don't remember the exact first game I played but the games I played the most as a kid were Ratchet & Clank, Jak & Daxter, Sly Cooper, Okami, Pokemon XD, and Emerald.
Also NFL 2k5 but that's sports that doesn't really count.
it would have been way better if i made it 1800
yeah i made this years ago for restreams
was just messing with obs cuz of dumb frame drop issues
hopefully you can unfuck it morp
yeah i was streaming for 30m at 6k bitrate like normal and didn't drop at all
I love all the art and stuff all throughout the ruins, it makes it feel properly lived in
I mean,,,,,, they did give up their worldly possessions to ascend
so it's not THAT far off
this time, it's 🔥 instead of poison
Yes made it just in time for my fave weaponry
thankfully upgrades don't have to be scanned
I do like these kinda nested rooms
do you wanna know of expansions you may miss, too? Or just scans?
yeah you've missed a few sadly
did i miss the message that you were starting this?
do you wanna know where the other is?
you were looking straight at it a few mins ago and I was LAUGHIN
the boss that everybody spells wrong
Flaahgra has a weird spelling in fairness
it *looks* like it should have an h at the end of its name
I tried watching the sonic unleashed port, its def not for me. It was straining my eyes just watching it
when was the last time you revisited this?
@Axl_SR they buthcered the wolf and its stages to pieces
im curious to see what direction it goes in, the speedrunenrs are fawning over it from what ive seen
i was not familliar with that achievement lol
what are the good ones for this game?
this gamw is a good one as a whole
depend on how hard those sequence break are i guess
so if you play an updated version that patched stuff out you cant do the sequence achievements?
some of the speedrun sequence breaks are awful
like early power bomb with infinite speed is DUMB
you can softlock in 50 different ways lol
god yeah the sequence breaks in this game are rough
like going back to snag the artifact of sun immediately after is ass
some are bad like that yea
100% scan suck because of missables
one random enemy is permanently missable in rift
at least its not prime 2 level of missable
where you have to scan some boss up to three times LMAO
There's a few two scans in Prime but gods yeah 2 was ROUGH
one of the worst offender is a one time door scan during a miniboss fight
I still have yet to officially beat 2
my least fave missable in 1 is probably that one weirdo regional bat in Phendrana West
I really enjoy this games rando, alot of it is dependent on if you like the tank controls. It always just clicked with me, but I never liked twin stick controls anyways. It does have me nervious about what direction prime 4 goes in
2 is good just dont try to hundo it
2 isn't the worst to hundo
3 is easiest to hundo I feel likee
I am a lil concerned with 4, I imagine it'll be better on pro controller than the joycons
tho, that's just the remaster controls speaking
I didn't *hate* the remaster controls with joycon, but since I'm at an angle with my switch it's a bit weird
I didn't like 3 because it was just...too easy
in comparison to 1 and 2
i just didnt have the opportunity to really play 3
but it took out elements I enjoyed about 1 and 2
3 seems too narrative driven compared to 1 and 2 ill be honest
i think it will be less so then 3
Yeah, I do like the idea of the other hunters and all, but it took away the environmental narrative and also the free world exploration
god wilds story really quickly turned into a chore
I have to imagine it'll be more open, since they've been pushing open world exploration in other franchises
I would accept less environmental storytelling so long as they kept the open world exploration vs the linear stuff we experienced in Corruption
wonder if M4 is doing anything about their vods or do they even care?
I did not expect to see this when I clicked on the stream
I'm sure Mx4 knows by now
The only thing I know about Prime 1 is that Tommy Tallarico lied about working on this game
shoutouts to "The Room" from Dread
Tommy Tallarico also lied about working on Tony Hawk Pro Skater
No. Gotta pay for that lore
Madge this is why everyone got rid of pay as you can
yea look at mario it should launch up
this room can be very annoying
look i'm feeling good about life right now
also THPS3+4 revealed, and apparently you'll finally be able to set up custom goals for your custom park
i've been wanting that since THPS2
oh i just preordered it on PS5 and it was mentioned on the store page there lol
high score for my park: 42,069. pro score: 69,420. sick score: 696,969
That's cool. Only THPS game I played was 4 and I enjoyed it a lot.
they have given me too much power
another goal idea. the requirement is going off a really tall jump and fall into a large hole. goal name: "just die lol"
They should have brought back the monkeys for Hyrule Castle
The controller doesn't clicky clack, it's more like a difty stick
Does the boomerang z puzzle work starting top or bottom? or is there a specific one you have to start with?
I still don't understand how boomerang jumps work in this game
and this only works in the gamecube version yea?
The boomerang jumps work exactly the same way midna jumps work, except with the boomerang and not midna
Weird, I've tried to get it working on HD, maybe I'm dumb lol
But I mean, that is essentially why it works LUL
Right, but they added those mechanics because Midna jumps
I honestly didn't think about that
It's just always been in my head because it *is* essentially what midna jumping accomplishes, just in scripted locations
Ok, but then I do still rest my case LUL
It is basically like a midna jump just with boomerang and not midna, and only for some values of boomerang LUL
Why would you do that @PhantomGamesBot ?
The post office is a critical piece of infrastructure Madge
If phantom pbs I'll delete the post office holding our friend hostage
i did not form the sentence in my head
that's almost as good as, what was it, the fry randomizer?
my friend just got a card graded and got a PSA 1 the group chat is in hysterics
I love how YouTube is like a whole 10 seconds behind KEKW
ye it doesn't bother me until I noticed it LOL
I picked out a TP prize this year for Speedtember
I need to pick out some more stuff, but yea starting to get stuff organized
submissions in total? let me see
Not including my own runs, we have 21
Keep in mind, a lot of them submitted all of their runs all in one submission
No no that's totally fine, once May comes around I'll be sitting down and getting a schedule made. Since it's only gonna be 1 week this time around.
Yea submissions should end in May, schedule should be made then and well we go from there. I need to figure out how I'm gonna pull stream & audio this year, because I feel doing it through Discord wasn't great.
It might be *slightly* desync'd but that's fine.
are there more bugs in this version of the game?
Some have 12 yea, but I think faron and lan have 10
Cheer270 uh so I have 270 bits, and idk what to do with em so here ya go LOL
Oh that's the clip where he kills Eggman
no hit challenge ganondorf amiibo zora armor
good luck, you will die in one hit
You can't mash b on that and then a?
B on WiiU will always select the negative option
BIGBUGGIES says no to B Buttons ButtonMash ButtonMash ButtonMash phanto274Mash phanto274Mash phanto274Mash
am I the only one that gets extreme Metroid Prime vibes from the bugs in this game?
Hey all! gonna keep obiyoLurk phanto274Lurk tippiLurk silent1053Lurk cmdrglUrk
I think you can hookshot them in oot/mm
Oh god the game is lagging LOL
Good god the gamecube is gasping for breathe
put on tony hawk pro skater music
So when is the Phantom5800 Partner Push so we can shorten your name to Phantom oranMonka
hey I did it so can you KEKW although, full transparency, it was so fucking stressful
It'll take a while, you're at least consistent, which says a lot already
hell yeah stab him through the ass
TP AD w/ AS (ass stab)
call it ass super stab so you can abbreviate it as ASS :p
if only Link could breathe underwater :(
Crazy there's just enough time to fall to the bottom
why couldn't Link just drown before reaching the bottom so you would just have to get the zora armor lol.
this fight already kinda sucks vanilla, having to do it with limited air just makes it even more awful :(
Yeah this just looks horrible overall
cool trick to get air though
Holy BALLS it’s another Phantom stream phanto274Pacepal
Link needs to work on his broad jump
No I’ve never done that KEKW
Nah the wind is so annoying
this is taller than the tokyo tower
can the fire damage you if you walk into it?
Did you get your comfy friends espeon yet cause it came top the us site 👁️
Yea it was added a few days ago
I copped the eevee which is how I know lmao
Damn am I that predictable etchyLmao
Yea I noticed that too ):
It hates when I use firefox
No pls I want to keep firefox
casually idk I think Blizzeta is my fave.
this boss is definitely not my fave
altho the 2nd phase is fine.
It took me so long to grab the destinations backpack again
Where's my tpci connection I would like to suddenly work for pokemon thanks
Let me be the 2nd western designers :)
health is a useless resource anyway.
Esp since umbreon had already sold out
at some point when I have more space I'm prolly gonna get a plush of all the eeveelutions if they're available.
It's PMD ofc but you might want to pick a diff pink pokemon
Espeon is close to skitty but not quite you know
NOOOO i failed my 1st quest on monster hunter
PMD uses skitty + cynda for speedrun lol
oh man I played the PMD blue rescue team
I was not a huge fan of EO:TSD but I think it's generally well received too.
I was watching a YouTube exercise video and somehow as I was doing my exercise it switched to a 600 pound life video KEKW
Like “do you know what it would be like to be 600 pounds?!” like no why do you think I’m trying to exercise lmao
"this is what will happen if you don't do these exercises" LUL
It was legit a scare tactic KEKW
Cuz you didn’t practice it enough smh NOPERS
I can make up an answer if that'll help :P
clearly it's because you threw it too high and Link's neck is sore and can't look up that far.
Brb gonna lurk for a bit
what do you mean by that
let me check back in the vod to see
you were still holding down for a tiny bit after throwing the boomerang
so link walked and cancelled the target
yeah before you throw just go neutral stick
that's all you have to do to fix it
if you're short you can probably just grab the chest up here
idr if it's a 10 or 20
the one pot the boomerang didn't touch lol
I executed the dot skip segment well in my pb but I still lost 20 seconds because of this stupid spider
Yeah I don’t like the hamburger KEKW
cuz I’m hungry I still have to make dinner Sadge
I had a day old bagel for lunch today it was not a good business decision
he just doesn't agree with the clawshot location
i enjoy all the dungeons in this game
this dungeon looks completely different with glitches tbh
all of the dungeons in tp are great except palace is ok and hyrule sucks
I think palace is a bit worse than hyrule imo
palace has the superior aesthetic but way too much waiting around. at least hyrule feels short
tower climb is like the only good thing about hc
palace has a better boss too
yea palace has the best boss in the game
is this your favorite zelda game just wondering haha
and i think it being technically challenging makes up for the waiting
zant can actually do things to you unlike most of the other bosses in this game
it is impossible to die to most bosses
Nah Dangoro is best boss smh
morpheel is actually impossible to die to unless you don't have zora armor
forest temple is also the best dungeon if you are saving the monkeys
Love the content. just landed on ur channel. will be here for a while grinding college while ur grinding too.
I used to really like glitchless snowpeak until lfc was found
western glitchless snowpeak is awesome though
@Draconif fyrus is also impossible to die to, who would ever do that Kappa
jp glitchless is do spinner bomb boost do lfc you're done
there's so many cool movement strats with it what do you mean
i think my worst tp take is that arbiters is a great dungeon
I don't think that's a bad take
it just fucking SUCKS if you speedrun it
i think it's a great dungeon in speedrunning too
I should clarify that I mean it sucks because it's so easy to lose time for no reason
thats true but i just always look forward to it because i always feel like i can gold it by 20 seconds
I've been practicing spinner segment on my nights off
because I keep losing 1 minute
I also just want to do any% again lol
I'll keep doing ad for a bit though
come back and get a 2:52 fr
Come back to the dark side Df NODDERS
I can get a 2:54 without lord skip so that is my goal
my endgame was BAD in my pb
after im done with gmrta ill either do ams or any% i think
actually i need to try twilight ILs to see if theyre fun or not
i haven't seen that popup before lol
yea that popup is weird ive had it happen a few times
I should improve my ams pb because it gets lost in sacred grove
but yeah AD is fun and all but it just feels like longer any% to me
i would like to go to wii any% sometime but not yet
like if I wanna do the dungeons I will do glitchless. I think that's what I've decided
also hundo is a great category i just wish it was like 3 hours instead of over 6
me who plans to do glundo at some point
I don't have a goal time for it I just want to do it for fun
you should do regular hundo too
and hundo can't do stallord skip 🤔
when I wanted to get back into the game last year but gave up because I only had JP I 100%ed the game like 4 times
@Draconif i thought you didnt like doing the trick anyway
oh my other bad take is that hugo is a great trick
yeah i don't do it that's why I like the though of it lol
mm is the only game I've done glitched hundo for
I've done glundo of oot and master quest though (lol)
Are there any special secrets in master quest or is it just that you only get 3 hearts lol
master quest is just different dungeons
Ohh that’s kinda cool though! I never knew that
i think im not gonna go back to wii any% until i figure out aeralfos skip with pointer
worst trick in the game fr
Done with family outing and it looks like its time to visit Zantos house
Stavros did you take more pics for your pfp PauseChamo
that remind me i still need to work on the plando but monster hunter is taking all my time KEKW
i had it like 20% done
if it costing 100k points it got to be good right
oh yeah I'm supposed to practice arbiter's
i'm modding my wii u rn so i might not chat a lot
but i wish you the best of luck
Zant is also just kinda a fuck
Noodles sound good tbh, in some fashion
yknow it always astounds me how much time passes in that cutscene
like so little happens it feels so short
It's very dramatic to make a giant wall fall
yo amish ty for the gl
yo Lopez ty for the gl
Love this guy tho despite the problems he gives
Wind Waker also has some nice rain soundwise
And it's so *quiet* with the rain as the only sound. It's so aesthetic for setting up the castle
a lot of zelda games set up hyrule castle as the scary hard dungeon, but in TP that's palace really. This game's hyrule castle is a different vibe and I really like it. Somber.
Especially with all the dead guards
yeah I feel like palace is the final dungeon and hyrule castle is an extended pre-finale story sequence
to just nail home the feeling of loss.
It kinda feels like the Moon, in some senses
this place is just a pass along to check to see if u have all the items
Like you kinda just go for it and have this foreboding feeling, but you can detour ans you get asked about yourself if you seek out FD. It feels like acceptance, in some facet
you only need 26 if you miss once. you should be good otherwise with 25
@Amishman19 okay but the miss is a strat it saves time
@nahtanojrepus depends which phase you miss
honestly once I got told about the EMAIL ME thing I can't unhear it
Gregorian chanting in this fight >
@Nahtanojrepus true that hahaphd drilled it into me
I love the laughing to sudden seriousness so much, I never get sick of it
the new controller has finished a run.
Oh hm. They eventually took out the sword from him I just realized
@FatPidgeyBirb nah they dragged his whole corpse to the sacred grove and put the sword back with him still skewered on it
will be a minute, need to wash dishes and refill water bottle, etc
Dont worry buddy 🫡 take your time
I’m dying at the video in general. I needed a good laugh this weekend KEKW
This is true but then the counter is ratting you out for being messy lol
I want to run but I found out my parents are getting divorced so my headspace is not where I want it to be phanto274S
what do you feel like trying to play
I’m also trying to get ahold of my mom but she’s not answering and it’s annoying me lol
just take the gate down Clueless
you know me so well lmfao
my new AD pb dies to blizzeta
I got my goal time but dying to blizzetta is...
well see, they started with goombario
and then spent 10 hours mourning that
well i have reason to actually say "thank you shaq" now lmao
well i've been craving chicken tenders and he apparently opened a chain of chicken restaurants called big chicken and i finally tried it and the chicken tenders were EXACTLY what i was craving lmao
size, consistency, breading amount, just perfect lol
I have free will and I will judge you
Wouldn't the BiT be done DURING the attempt?
Well your title says AD attempts AFTER a bit
Oh. I should have read it as ADvertisement?
@SwiftPichu_ wasn't expecting to see you in dtraitors chat the other day
Phantom knows I used to run sa2
you have a lot more chill there phanto274Wave
Yeah because there's no one there that's degen
You are not excused thank you
I never liked the mist games
Holy balls I can’t believe there’s a noob in chat
Holy shit there's a fucking trash toxic player in chat
I died to blizzeta today I'm ultra noob
I die to blizzetta every playthrough bc I lose so much health to the room after LFC
in my case I ran into her twice and died
Blizzetta as I see it is hit or miss
The timing of that line omg KEKW
Yo on data just stopping by to say hi no internet until Monday
Go fuck yourself until Monday tiger
You know swift I can still time out on mobile KEKW
The sentiment will linger on bitch
Don’t time out just full ban NODDERS
Phantom remind me to ban mid
By the way watching a friend play xenoblade 3 so I'm waiting for chapter 5 to happen to watch their soul die in real time
By the way how's the run running
Yo, maybe we do ams races some time now that I'm an ams gamer
I would do an ams race
considering my current pb gets lost in sacred grove for 2 minutes
I'll get last every time but I have fun doing it
doesn't have a lot of bs in it
the bad thing about it is just armogohma rngh
I learned a few interesting things about gohma
most of my shinies were female so the game said happy women's day too
a lil tad tped out so will be in and out gl on everything
hope ur day has been awsm birb
@stavros12c34anenoglou I'm doin alright, ty, hope your day goes well too stav
5 shinies for like 20 mins of play was pretty neat
Always good to see you live!
this is it, this is the one, this is it, this is the run ♪
I still use you paper mario randos to pass out at night. They are a thing of beauty
I always end up in awe everytime I see you do a run in any of these games. Speed running is such a foreign concept for me
I tried paper mario randos but I think my brains just a bit too smooth to do it well.
that's a mood, only rando I've gotten moderately decent at was Wind Waker
but I do love MM and Pape, tho I don't play em a lot
My main problem is I don't tend to invest on speed tech
My first ever rando attempt is still my best time to this day at 6.5 hours. Cant even get sub 7 and I think I know more now than I did on that first run. I dont think speed runners get enough credit for how simple they make it look.
a lot of it is routing/sphere knowledge too, in addition to the speed shit
Yeah. I never could get the tracker to fill in for me properly without a lot of messing around.
📝 never understood how that worked
I might do some image recognition stuff for console trackers
items show up long enough on the text box to where you can do it
the weird thing is figuring out what key you just picked yp
do autotrackers have color tolerance in programming? That's neat
@FatPidgeyBirb they do if you program them to
Id be building it from scratch if I do it
like I did my auto tracker for dolphin
only reason I haven't done so yet is cuz I don't really want to atm
Yeah I have to imagine you'd need some sort of way to track hue differences and shit, still cool in theory
like a freak magic wand tool
yeah, but if it was implemented
its how fast the text box vanishes in rando
since you said it wasn't, I said 'in theory', knowin that stuff exists even if not programmed in now
OCR would just read all the text on the screen for me automatically
the item icon always shows up in rando too
so I can always check that spot
I'm an illustrator so I'm thinkin from an art program
well, the image recognition doesn't look at art like we do
what are some of the harder achievements in this?
they look at the raw pixel values
there's some pretty gross sequence breaks
oh I more meant challenge playthrough stuff, but if you don't know anything that's fine
actually i've never played any metroid game
stuff like 98% no space jump
hard mode is pretty whatever, its just enemies have more health and you take more damage
so if you know the game already it's just longer and not any different
what are you doing to the children
I guess under 3:30 IGT is a pretty good achievement
DF isn't that the time zoid said was his "speedrun" before the game came out
I've been training an ai to learn how to play smash bros brawl endless with nothing but images
that would be a funny reference
under 3:30 wouldb e hard for me
image recognition has come a long way
I forget what ch0m's record is
wow df echoes has some cool achievements
"defeat chykka in under 2 minutes and 15 seconds"
that's a very specific amount of time
I wonder if I could do that without seekers
oh I misread, 2:15 is adult only
I thought metroid music was all dark ambience
any5 is a lil over an hour
I can beat adult in 5 seconds
is there an achievement for doing item loss skip
doesn't prime 1 have an sjf one?
it's beat the game, time challenges for each boss, beat the game on hard mode, and get all scans
oh also a sub 4 hour completion
sub 4 for echoes is tough...
collission in t his game is funky
don't think I can sub 4 echoes either
Echoes is a tougher game and the better game overally
I wanna play echoes again soon I really want to grind for 49
honestly if I played again I think I could get 47. my 48 is pretty good but the beginning was really bad
20 seconds lost in the first 13 minutes kill me
prime 59 wouldn't take that long either I think. just gonna not do the stupid stuff and rely on movement to get it
and that should make it not too bad
you have the prime 2 fundamentals you should be able to get sub hour
just do mostly inbounds but do ibbfaf or something
Just got back from my job interview
I wish I understood what anyone was saying
this is a good game though you should try it
they're speeddrunning nerds, that is the translation
It went well, I hear back from them next week
@nozomup you're a tp runner right? I think I recognize the name
I don't usually run prime 1, but prime 2 is my bread and butter
dont even have to emulate then
phantom forgot physics after being a ghost for so long
it is time for you to learn the way of bomb jumping young phantomo
yeah you should learn horizontal bomb jumps (that don't go horizontally at all)(
we are very good at naming things
lmao I was gonna make the same joke
could be worse, could be named how Celeste tech is named
we also have a trick called uber bomb jump
don't forget Really Good Bomb Jump
I will personally fight whoever decided to name shit like 'coosting'
is that supposed to be "coasting" but playful or something
need i forget we call out of bounds "secret worlds"
and then there's chaining tech, reversing tech, etc so you get some *really* fucked up names
there is a technique in wii called spring john bomp
Spring ball is in remaster too
yeah it's a remastered tech too
spring balling right before a bomb explodes gives you an insane amount of height
I struggle with it, I'll stick to basic bomb tech like a basic bitch
so instead calling it a spring bomb jump, I called it a spring john bomp
df remember when we found that space jump early setup on remastered
and the videos blew up with people saying we cheated
there was one comment on my SJF video that was like "too much text explain with voice"
I tried for like 45 mins outta curiosity and I couldn't get it, I musta missed it
place bomb 2 right before bomb 1 explodes
you can space the final 2 bombs much closer as well
you have learned a double bomb jump
You play any new games recently?
I've dabbled in a little bit of world
nice. Never tried a Monster Hunter game I prolly should at some point. Been playing KC:D2 and Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon recently. The latter is in EA but it's been pretty fun, heavily influenced by Skyrim for anyone that wants a game like that.
I have some friends who play a lot of mh, I was gonna try the new one
but holy moly it just doesn't run, my friends didn't grab it either
to make a shitpost sloppy photoshop edit
I did get the two older ones on pc though
I've heard there's a simple code line you can change to make it better, but it's an unofficial fix
nah there's some fundamental stuff going on with asset streaming, turning camera and stuff
I'm too picky so I could never enjoy it unfortunate
I just like playing games at high refresh, low input lag etc
so when the demo booted up and its like "turn on frame generation?" I got bad vibes instantly
I upgraded to 32gb recently and a 3060 12gb, it was very nice
yeah I have a 11900k/3060ti I made like 3 years ago, I'll upgrade again in a couple years
still really happy with it, this gpu was so good for the price
previous I was running a poor 960m laptop 😆
I feel like the monetary jump between 3060/4060 stuff just isn't justified for the performance difference, even as someone who does 3D stuff/unity work
AV1 video encoding on the 40 series is nice though.
iis this a non gay channel ?
mine was a 1060 rtx before so 3060 was a nice upgrade
For one I am here so that makes this gay by default by me being here
ii thought i was going to have a good time
so much gay here I am being oppressed 😭
I put the cheers in queers and all that
fuckin excellent use of rainbow dicks
I love this room. I wonder what it was like before nuclear winter descended on this place
ssup dudes with a penchant for men to men lore relatated stuff
tthe fudge is going on my male born men
adding "non gay" to my future theoretical no out of bounds stream
someone a couple weeks ago streamed echoes with "no oob no pronouns" in the title
and I thought it was gold
on pal onward these guys have like double health
iif any trap would be a trap a she gothtrap is up there
mmama ones to be more accurate
the drop system in this game isn't the best
the drop table is based on what room you are in currently
and some of the choices they made are pretty suspect
echoes is smarter in that it takes into account what you have
like if you're under 20% HP, you have an 80% chance of an ultra energy drop
or 80% for 10 missiles if you have 0 missiles, or 80% for a power bomb with 0 power bombs etc
yeah normally they expect you to have more than 25 missiles I imagine by now
25 is pretty reasonable here tbh
I'm the chronic collectathon nerd in games, so I always get here with like, 60
except it doesn't have a flared base
made it in time o see my fave armor comin up
how u liking it so far?
@stavros12c34anenoglou that's not for a while iirc
Phantom just got wave, I think it's post third beam you see second armor upgrade
I always forget about the unique music in this room
this room has a unique version of the "puzzle" song
but this room can just be jumped up without doing anything, so you don't get to hear it outside of casual playthrough
oh I thought I was being gaslit and hearing a different version of Phendrana
I got the W but Azura got a PB and was close, was in P2 final as I finished
Yeah, Amishman finished when I was getting Peach Beam. So close!
God this game looks stunning for the GameCube
this game looks *so* goddamn good
honestly 480i on crt looks even better
Retrotink 4k putting in work monadoChad
@fatpidgeybirb dangit, now I'm hungry! *points*
Stupid autocucumber, that was supposed to be "pouts"
Oh and turning in the Vase was necessary. Lol
I love this room it's so cool
Seems like nothing bad will happen now
I thought there was one more :Va that alluded to Prime 2
did you plug your input display into your pc or do you just use different controllers for playing on dolphin?
I have a mayflash and it doesn't work doing that for some reason, no idea why
I think it works for others
and I don't want to use PC mode because it functions differently with mappings
I don't practice much on dolphin anyway
I've used Mayflash before, it's touchy
that's my last 3 braincells be nice to them
surely Phazon Metroids aren’t that bad
Same reason they blocked the save station
they don' want Samus gettin through at any cost
that’s where my music is from EZ
yeah the Pirate dip can suck
they really want you to missile I guess
getting back out is half the challenge of getting safely to thermal, I suppose
They do warn about it in the guidebook, I remember
how it feels to goron roll
everything looks Thermal beam to me
metroids are obnoxious till you get ice
this part of the game fucks
this was probably one of the first spooky segments i experienced in a game as a kid
this game definitely has some terror aspects to it
always an amusing sound from that room
I forgot how much this fight sucks
couldn't imagine doing it without thermal
SUch a beautiful game the bosses so exquisite.
oh no u reached ur gameplay limit?
thepri67Wave phanto274Wave tippiWave cmdrglWave thanx for epicness
You ever thought about an origami dick?
@SwiftPichu_ First thing I see when I join, this gonna be good
Did you change your Webcam res or something? I'm seeing more fps at least
I'll go fuck myself then, excuse me
Yeah, that checks. My Mining session in Star Citizen got shoved forward an hour in Discord but I sure as heck wasn't expecting it
I want to break out of this damn icebox. It's about to feel like spring but I gotta get through tonight first
Phantoms thoughts exactly when rolling this seed
Oh, gimme a sec, gotta flop my monitor
eh so which settings are NOT on?
Wait, WTF? I just flipped the monitor....hang on I'll put it ba....wait... frick
I don't know what would be worse, complete mirror, or this where it's random
When random settings go too far apparently. And here I thought inverted Metroid Prime 2 worlds was weird
the mirroring is making my brain lumps hurt
Still waiting on the new set
2 out of 3 turtles already
You can do it, just gotta SNIFFA it out.
i love how para is lifting mario but has a lot of issue doing it
so phantom what possessed you to do *gestures wildly* this
These look like some settings lol
its either this or play minecraft
Yeah mario stop being a bitch
Can't wait for a hammer or bomb to  be here
All the collective money for a can of soda
got my prep for st.patty day meal
Seems like pretty normal behavior for a raphnet adapter
Was it just moving on it's own?
That's just a feature of the raphnet
I've had 2 raphnets for wii guitar hero controllers and both had the same issue you're having
I am so confused why are some maps flipped?
It's one of the rando settings
It will either be mirrored or regular
Let’s see you get past the chapter MadgeRn
um excuse me mx strimmer, did u kno u can jump out of spins to save time?
oh *ew* the map is flipped, I always forget this is a thing
You can also use the whale now
Oh did shit cheeto have bombette
So we just need sushi to clear most of chapter 5
How many stars for haven access?
theoretically couldn't you spam power shock to beat fuzzipede? or is power shock too expensive?
Found out today there's a halal chicken and burger place opening literally right around the corner from my house
I am blessed to have so many banger local restaurants within walking distance
I can’t believe we’re watching the rando WR rn
did I just walk into marcoMode
So about that castle key you mentioned...
Why are you working the turtle so hard smh
I gotta dog. He was abandoned
I remember when this was a flutter noises stream :(
Since there is a lul in the rando action I guess i will ask this. Are u really that serious into Bomberman as ur next adventure and run Ice?
Yeah, I eventually wanna learn BM64
Phantom is it bad I’m yet to make more than 12k channel points and I feel like I’m in your stream all the time KEKW
I need to stop redeeming yugioh
Alright then ill take the awkward penalty in ur chat board then bc i dont get along with any of there community members.
That kid won't accept this mail that has their name on even in the jungle?  Madness, I'd say.  MADNESS
I had a run that was 1:44 ahead and died to Null & Void :)
But Risch, no one dies to Null and Void
jugoomba shaking in his boots after that stream
Only 2 Prisms, both got eaten by them, and then by the time I drew LifeSword as a backup, I was at 60 hp and moved into one that teleported onto me
And he had just queued up a PA, it was sad
if this wasn't on the nintendo online, this game might have getting the switch remake instead of thousand year door.
I know you picked up the real one
But you should check it incase
Is that enough to fight Jr?
Not that bad an option with 8 in toybox yeah
The incentive is you get to skip it later YEP
We just got a letter I wonder who it’s from Hmm
oh wow toy box is flipped around
The child gave part of herself to you
GL, ill be back in a bit talk about my league race
Yo finally have pc set up
at least it matches the dungeon. There aren't just random magikoopa
so I did a solo banjo seed, its a bit better with hints now. I run 15 out of 60 so not every hint sign is a handout. Then I did my first league race with Mazarus. Seed was very fast. Hit go mode at 1:10 but end game fights were very rough. Ended with a 2:05 with rushing last 3 chapters + ch8 taking nearly an hour.
don't you you still need star stone to beat that?
because I forgor dungeon entrance rando was on
i love it as it is, would not change a thing LUL
I personally didn't mind the prime control scheme when I played through it
liked echoes more than the first one though
also partner upgrades were the worst. I only found like 4 of them
the only good one was dizzy shell being 1 FP and I didnt have any reason to use it lol
i joined on a whim cause they needed one more for even teams. I already regret my decisions
these settings arent great for "races"
which settings are you talking about (I kinda have no idea what is even on for s3/4
fully random is just too much
don't talk about my kid like that, he's narrating.
What about the other watchtower? Or is that more of a pointless turret lol.
the solo banjo tooie rando had its logic added in the latest release
the one with the big ass ladder that Auru is on I meant. Does that not count as a watchtower? lol.
laki is going to be behind that red jar
saw a post that made me laugh in Pape AP, "When can we expect a poptracker update by Phantom? the last ID change broke the tracker pack which just says random stuff now". Me laughing to myself, "thats a good question considering they dont check this channel" LUL
also goin to phanto274Nom ghunzoNom obiyoNom NomNom
I also ran into a issue with emotracker autotracking, but I dont remember what it was so it cant be that important LUL
HUH people use a tracker for pape
"What emulator do I need to use for the APPM64? It doesn't seem to open on Project 64?" Very next message: "thats your patch file"
Do you have all the Fortress Keys you've seen? I remember you skipping one early on
could you technically do staircase skip to skip a fortress key but it would be out of logic
Kid would you take this letter off of my hands, it's addressed to you.  No?
oh did you only have 1 key on your first vist to the fortress than?
couldn't you than have done staircase skip than activated the shortcut past the 3rd key and than use that to get back up and skip the 2nd key
couldn't you still check jail+pit though
Man why is it that there's nowhere that sells meatloaf in the supermarket
6 is a lot of checks
I'm back, how have we not found the cloud turtle
Surely they're both just in 6 at this point though, right?
I love throwing channel points into an open fire
back that was good and 4 hr mark
Might be bad news for the believers but we'll see
I am still callen it laki is going to be on red jar turn in
So basically if laki isn't vanilla or moles I lose phanto274Cry
I need to save my luck for the end of the month
Both for Quarter Century Stampede and well for something else
Now here's a fun question Which comes first ultra hammer, or laki
You could kill 1 bit and  block 0
the king has let us passed for this rando
It's kinda nice seeing CK not being a total dick on power shocks
Go beat 2 and then you can finish Koot
Scarf would be nice so you don't have to sushi glitch up the mountain again
At least radio + melody is good synergy
So where is this elusive Turtle in a Cloud
Sing a melody get a letter to Goompapa for the Turtle in a cloud
I love when my turtles are locked behind doing tasks for an older turtle
So go mode was locked behind a melody
GreyGoose is hitting real good. and yeah marcoMode
after you finish this seed I recommend taking 300mg of Fukitol KEKW
fave character became my 2nd fave boss KEKW
i just got here and my eyes are confused
who is this for exactly KEKW
Deadge been sleeping on a couch for the pass 2 days getting a new Bedge and its gonna be here in 2 to 7 business days
the couch also sucks ass KEKWait
i am really hoping it come in 2 business days (tuesday) YEP
also lost a part to my monitor mount Sadge
just saw the stupidest arcade stick I've ever seen in my life
It's an aluminum arcade stick with support for 20 different consoles
Also it has 10 Dreamcast VMUs built in
oh and no insta-warp to the door?
don't have to do door minigames, but still have to traverse
that bothered me on a spiritual level
oh hell no, not actual quiz questions
Frankly that bothered me and I've done that trick less times than most
they are all the same colors to me LuL
what'd the bot call me ? ? ?
can we never do that again k thanks
Cheer100 Shadow: Where's that damn fourth Chaos Emerald?
@buff00n do you want a fight stick with 10 built-in dreamcast VMUs?
that was an amazing cutscene lmao
Cheer100 Bits for the bits train
@buff00n look at this stupid thing I'm about to dm you
just finished updating my budget and found some monies lying around
how come I didn't get gifted a sub? It's unfair :(
Be dover is an epic p0rn marcoStar
@Darkness3827 it's not letting me gift you a sub. I think Twitch is broken
once I started keeping a budget I literally saw $2k just sitting there
@lordofduh Try gifting a tier 3 that might fix it :P
If this reversed the hallway fight too...
oh hey thanks for the gift phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
Did you never find Power Bounce or is it bad?
Oh, uh, I think some of the stuff in the bottom right isn't updating
Tell me where the game hit you to do glundo
I know asking this is a stretch but... Do you know any stories about the great video game crash of 1983?
I used to work with a guy that was around for it, he had some cool stories but naturally i dont remember them
I just think its a cool topic that most people would find interesting
tomorrow Im doing 2 races with Adam phanto274S
who is winning the first redeems btw?
16 races in 2 months, gotta start the crunch
i could be at way more KEKW but you know
im running out of points btw
so name redeems need to come from others for a while
My plans got canceled today so I told Peaches its a good day for minish cap
but i am gonna be -100k whenever i go back to making the plando
the plando i was working on was about 20% done YEP
yeah for that point cost, if it was 75-80K id be more willing
I've been making a few changes to the formatting so it's easier for me to read lmao, idk if I also made changes in the doc I sent you
yo tiger ty for the gl
is this where we come for God's intended category?
Yo lopez ty for the gl
yo pp ty for the gl
What's the lore behind this meme?
Yo blopez Ty for the gl and always hitting the 😺 emoji
still haven't found my missing piece for my monitor mount Madge
have you tried to MacGyver it yet
I was meaning to add the counts at the end of each chapter so I can catch up easier when I inevitably start missing them
i could buy a replacement part for 18 bucks or the whole thing again for 45 YEP
do you know if you're going to rpglb
I'll be in Denver for a few of the days so if you get in on a day I'm there I'd watch
ooh no vaporeon leafeon glaceon or sylveon yet
Then you probably want to be hired YEP
hello goat gl with the runs today
yeah its, hard to read especially on stream lol
can't type my phone cUsse hand too et from showver
Well what do we have someone actually celebrating Mario
i heard we gotta get a fire bar, specifically one of them.
when you feel like resetting it's important to remember what the wise Hokage Naruto once said:
"LMFAO dude I kissed Sasuke AND bagged Hinata and we made a baby how fucking sick is that?"
is there a way to swim faster in minish cap?
ambassador program was pretty cool, then the internet told me it was bad and i never used it again LUL
thats like 30 x 7 days
i forgot how long it takes for the 360 to download things lol
i heard the switch 2 should have wifi 6 at least
i remember getting a red xbox 360 for my bday back in 2009 monkaSTEER
i misinterpreted glundo as gl hundo
gl is always good luck for me unfortunately
Madge found a lg gold crown monster and he left the area before i could save the quest
you always seem so much happier playing this than TP
I'm so glad they fixed this for rando
that would be extremely painful for hammerless when you just have bombette
kooper is bad to but bomb lady would be worse
Did you know... In japanese, Bombette's name is "Pinky" and her body slam move is called "PINKY ATTACK"
yo good luck, I’ll be working and lurking
I had to practice desert and forest cleanly a few times in the week to make it muscle memory
I want to get green station and the sewers section at the end
to be muscle memory like that
I'm pretty sure there's a cycle you can hit but it's really tight
I think my 3 attempts had 6, 7, and 7
need that in regular glitchless fr
Would you fuck a rat or a dragon?
today is a great day to watch a glundo
thats probably the only reason why i prefer flurries gale force is it gives you star points
gl on every other rng check
ahh because of peril strats im guessing
you have to go further right before going down
yeah I always miss the 10c block in ch4
or where you hit it from?
you don't have to hit the shy guy
oh lol well mine does too then
I'm on mobile rn or I would lolll
maybe I'll try this room with a zoomed out cam or something
I wonder if you need to one spin to the box on the way back
how is it 101% when you dont make soapcake?
Can I ask a dumb rando question?
At the beginning of each seed, you talk to FiceT and he gives you something. But he never does when I try. What setting am I missing?
ahh, yeah i imagine the varience can be frustrating for this catagory
It's unsettling how she never turns the stove off, how has this lady's house not burned down yet?
@TheWitchyHazel she just never stops cooking
if your born with the name tayce T its your destiny
Well at least she seems happy in her labors
what happens when strimmer starts making mistakes?
wait why is merlon still standing outside his house? KEKW
It's amazing how mathed out this run is
Yooo Phantom, happy mario day! phanto274Heart
yeah just need reps of reating correctly
i got the star piece in the water and just left lmao but i realized after i took the lz
i'm still downloading a game on my 360 how is this so slow
it's lost odyssey, i never actually downloaded it to my 360 so i'm doing that now so i can back it up in case they make a recomp for it like with unleashed
i played that game once couldn't get into it
i also have blue dragon lol
i got mine from maddy's brother who was getting rid of it lol
offered it to us, so why not
@Mirby_Studios now that a good game
idr how many i had but i do know i had two in ch1 lmao
okay it just jumped from 80% to done lmao
i remember playing blue dragon one time and look at the time and said what the fuck its 4am
5PM hit and the 360 went "okay time to stop throttling"
Allergy season is kicking my ASS rn
so you have a natural defense against people telling you to touch grass, that's great
I need to get prepared bc soon I'll be suffering
I got a Frosty Ice Kirby plush
i should figure out where that guy moves to lmao
i think if no all or nothing then we can skip jungle rebadge but i'll have to list 2 separate ones probably
2nd fave has arrived on the scene what does petey have to say
yeah like 360 going into sewers
yeah straight right i think that might just happen sometimes
i didn't see it tho lol
i think there was nothing you could do there lol, i think it helps to walk a frame first but you can still 4 spin going above
this fucked me up too lmao, i should make it more readable
probably 2 tries if i had to guess since you need bombette anyway
hardest item to get in this glundo or hardest thing to accomplish in this glundo
i just realized i never bought the spagonia DLC for unleashed
i got the rest of the DLC just not that one for some reason lol
yeah i was just thinking that
you can still buy 360 games via browser on PC then download on 360 even though the store is shut down
backwards compatibility on the Xbone and Series X/S
they have to keep the 360 games up on the browser for thsoe
Oh hey, Xbox, I know this stuff
whats funny is maple syurp repel gel life shroom and shooting star supposedly have a worse drop rate then jammin jelly on lil oinks
Stuff that isn’t backwards compatible is still installable from the 360 if it’s in your purchase history and hasn’t been hard delisted entirely, but you can’t get anything you have bought/downloaded before
yeah it took me a bit to find download history on my 360 lol
BC stuff is still available through the modern Xbox store (on Series X essentially), which is why it’s also available on the website
and then it took like 3 fucking hours to download lost odyssey
if they do announce a nuts and bolts recomp i am gonna actually buy that lol
i literally read that and then went below 360 coins 10 seconds later
Yeah, 360 download speeds are atrocious. Took me days to download everything back when the store went down, which was only like a couple hundred gigs
Viva Pinata does have a GFWL version, but Trouble in Paradise obviously doesn’t
I bought a GFWL disc of Viva Pinata recently just because I could, lol
i recently switched from xbox to gc and im actually not sure how i feel about gated stick
what makes this 101% vs 100%
so its just 100 with req optional miniboss
the blocks are kinda fast compared to like selling
tossing would be faster still by like 2s
heart block is like 2s, toss is like 1.5s, eating is like 5.2s
would have to time exactly what the drink animation is but tossing would still be faster
Truly a joy on the day
it's supposed to be give lyrics to simon right
oh so red house is melody?
I preordered a physical version of the Croc Remake back in novemeber. Finally today is the last day to preorder so hoping that it ships soon
reminder than quizmo doesnt care about your splits
how many coins do you need for badges
sell repels and honey candy i think will be good
yeah honey candy sells for 15 and repels sell for 30 at harrys shop
oh there's only one spare repel right
if you need goomba village shooting star sells for 20 at south
hey phantom gl with the hundo...1?
it was good played kh2 rando for the first time in 7 months
uhhh its kinda like if chapter 4 was locked by the end of chapter 7 being locked behind 4th ruins key  that was locked behind saving the yoshis in terms of logic
Yo gl with the end of the glundo Phantom!
do you know if bony beetles can first strike you with their spiky attack
oh you need 8 fp for final
fan smack would be too much
unless you still have honey candy
oh lol actually you can fan smack, i didnt account for the 2 fp outta sight
just need to race again surely
nah you could with this route im sure and some good quizmos
Just press A the mash session phanto274Mash
I lost like 9 mins for free and I'm sure I could save another 5 from playing better
just being more familiar with the route
someone summon Malleo back to do a glundo TAS
random are you gonna submit your run to lb or nah
thats like 2 runs a day wdym
what’s M4’s pb? I forget if I got record lol
i think m4 is 10s faster
I’m pretty sure I’ll come back to glundo one day
especially would this route being better
depending on what 6:1x grind is like I'll consider trying 6:0x
none of those were record i think lmao, pretty sure m4 first run was sub 7
I remember thinking I’ll submit once I beat m4’s time, and then I stopped lol
m4 in october, random in december 2023
Today Chrono Trigger is 30 years old
my new Bedge is here well my mattress still waiting on Bedge frame
Hello, how long have you been speedrunning on this Zelda?
The trick is just that dogshit
Imagine if you miss WR by 1 frame
And you coulda had it if you broke the box perfectly
I would 100% delete my twitch
unless its ur own record that u tie u shouldnt shame for not reaching anothers by a sec but that said by a non runner.
Wish I could pick up a rock and it shits out a dollar
yeah the polygon or ingame matter doesnt matter on ur gate phasing but in oot and mm digits can effect the way things work and ww
Staring straight into that keese's soul
Maybe that why his mouth was open...
Chuckie not a care in the damn world
It's chrono trigger's 30th birthday today
HolidayPresent HolidayPresent HolidayPresent PartyPopper PartyPopper PartyPopper The firs game to introduce multiple endings
living example over here, I am pretty sure SMW and Link to the past are older then I am phanto274Lurk
also gl with the runs PrideFlower
I play Z1 and Z2 and they came out 86 and 87 lol
I played Z1 as the NES classic GBA game PrideLaugh
I'm so sorry to hear that Jon
tried Z2, but fuuuuck that game got some stupid decisions in it
@Iceblue I also did 2nd quest KEKW
he didnt get to have those noises in the PAL cartridge dafuq?
that being said I probably woulda been fine w it - not like TMC link is any less loud KEKW
LTTP I know did it yea
kinda blanked it out, as said: TMC Link sword spam and such
fuck having to do Map glitch in the GBA LTTP to reach the 4sword dungeon if you dont have ppl to play that with btw
I refuse to watch runs of that cause uhhh... yeah that sword swing  noise
guess I just grew numb to those types of repetitive noises - they dont phase me near as much as if say, sudden extremely loud outta nowhere does these days
so why is this bulblin called hugo?
I only know of HuGo the Hungry Goron in majoras
the fact this works is wild to me
Ik Skyward and TP use Back in time a bunch yea, think the biggest restriction Windwaker got is the quadrant / island system?
not necessarily think it would immediately get used unless it lets you get off an easier superswim over outsets given no sword / shield
like - you'd then have to have access to something for the early game
cus like.. swordless gohma I dont think anyone would want to do
wanted to say, the flag setting to immediately access iron boots before first twili section is big as well
therefore not having the dire NEED to repair a bridge via portals, having to dedicatedly go back just to get irons
note to self: back in time is hilarious for existing
skyward sword back in time is wild yea
so.. this jump has to be done cus while you got sword and shield, the gmae is stupid flags wise and wants you to complete the sword/shield gathering here?
and with this jump stuff you're doing, you can barely get past the blocking barrier?
shield shouldnt be the issue yea - I mean, this is the hylian, not the ordon or wooden shield
come to think I renember seeing that from when you do the switch to zora armorat argorok
which is hilarious then that the model loads in with phantom equips
while at the same time using those to put items out of the system
counterpoint which I dont necessarily get though
why not make sure the items in question are just flags for the item rather then tied to a story state
like - that bit I dont get
who in their right mind would do shit like that
I know I shouldnt ask - I mean, this is clearly not the first time a nintendo game has shown these weirdnesses
but like.. why do it like that, just tie the item to a unique "did get item?" flag *shrugs*
technically yes, practically could also just make it a per item "did get item" flag
no need to dupe it at that point, just ask the game if that's been ticked, if yes: dont spawn in, if no: spawn in
curious to hear where nintendo spagetti coded then
either way sounds like big restrictions, though still dont wanna believe every piece of code was used efficiently PrideLaugh
as much as it is all technically used up and such
Good afternoon and good luck on each and every dungeon!
and not necessarily in a always good way
like... at that point, you got some weird issues you're workin around
too bad this is a no reset, that box break trick might be a run breaker
I guess I am more surprised then I should be really
then again I wanna still stand by "nintendo might not have done the best coding job" given what all ppl by now have found out about the N64
where while it was super restricted in what you had available to work with, they did not use it 100% efficiently in some cases leading to hilarious side effects and shit
so like - my brain wants to believe that as much as they did utilize everything available, it might not always have been in a smart way
ya still get what I am tryin to get to tippiThink
fair enuff on that end - 100% take being super silly there
hugos hopped up on coffee and he's all out of adhd meds
I hope someone pees in his lemonade
ok I hate how well timed that was with link standing still lookin at whatshisface's stick
the subtitles are fighting between calling it gate clip and gay club
no resets until I decide to reset
you should reset in the marathon
will there be a donation incentive to put claw on x
Seeing as you skipped cutscene "NOT TAKE MIRROR"
I need to expand my tp collection
I have a wii disc that probably doesn't work anymore
2 english discs, 1 barely worksx
my first jp disc loads very bad because it's got some scratches over the years
it loaded 10 frames slower on average compared to my english disc looool
but my new jp disc actually loads 3 frames faster on average to my english disc
jp is probably faster for any% for me but uh yeah fuck wolfos jump
I respect it though it's ugly
I believe it's still faster even if you pause to unequip it later
but in this category you have no reason to unequip it
you need to look at the ground homie
Gl, is MOOFIN time for birbs. And dishes but yanno
I spy a needy kitty! So eepy
I wish I could see more than 3 pixels but alas, phone jail
You did send me a pic of him earlier while I was on my walk! I love he
I commend u for sending it while speedrunning that's some dedication to the cat tax
You ever thought how breedable zant is?
Or fucks to fuck in this case
is ams just the ending portion of AD
thats the same order in which I do the ms runs though
unless im like running an old route
am I supposed to be using them in other places in ams
cuz you need water bombs for refills
I've been kinda having issues with ams recently
for some reason im never happy with my spr sequence
always some stupid ass time loss
I found you cannot hit him more than twice or he will block ball and chain every time
thats the only darknut like that in the game
hes also the only one that blocks after 4 hits
I just learned the other way to line it up
I had it on in the bg and it sounded like Hugo was rude
you can start 3 minutes later
phanto274GL  hope you're having a good day
God I need to play this game again
Yeah that's the boat I'm in
I'll comms bn6 if you comms bn2 LUL
Oh I didn't even see the last run wtf
I gotta derust a game I haven't run in 4 years
Oh btw, Power up with Pride submissions are live too
I highly doubt I'm getting in for that
They hate z2, and bn2 is not a strong submission
Yeah I was weirded out by that
that spider's name is apparently "Myhouseisonfire"
Yeah phantom, get on the bus
bbl going out to eat. maddy and i haven't had a "date night" type deal in a while so why not now
ems is why i dont play this game lol
ems and s&ss is why I run ams
phantom i need to go to sleep, gn ily and gl
I'm wondering if the bonk is due to late timing of the jump attack
i run ams cuz im bad at game
i take it all dungeons didn't work out?
Mr Phantom I couldnt help your Legend was of Zelda
It seems be pretty of Midna ATM
making someone do their first TPR on monday
they played vanilla for the first time like half a year ago lol
im really good at staring at the groud
the annoying thing about banjo is i turn the camera to the wall to reduce lag but the camera shifts so I have to keep turning it back
my nose couldnt tell the difference
i swear i cant play good or consistently for shit
i want to be good so bad is my problem probably
desire to be good is fine, its more about respecting the process
things have been rough but ya know. im alive
yeah. Honestly im super anxious and overwhelmed but i still feel more calm than i have in the last like 2 years
almost like i removed the problem from my life LMAO
oh def. this is a different type of anxiety for sure. but i still feel so much freer and my skin in clearing up so i mean chemical reaction
i did live with mark for a period of time a few years ago
yeah. ive been trying to get him to let me do a haircutting stream with him but he never wants to
yeah. he lets it go long and then gets like a skin fade then lets it grow out again
and i just never get my hair done. like the last time i got it colored was in october
well, you can look at the like 3 inches of regrowth ontop of my green and its pretty long
its been on the back burner lol. but im hoping within the next few weeks i can get back into it
ive actually started playing the resident evil games. my friend game shared all his games with me and theyre his favorite and so im just playing through some of them
yeah we're gonna get in a vc tonight while i try to beat res 2
yeah. i watched the gameplay for 0 and 1 and was not interested until the are remade (which should be within the next year or so)
all i could think of while watching was "THE TIME LOSS"
im already bad at aiming can we be nicer with the camera
I think it was too far on the right side
sometimes you cant reach cuz this games weird if its in a specific spot on the pillar
apparently I should bitch more often about how bad I am
fucking up numerous random shit lol
I tried to learn this but I dont understand how it works
every time I do the jump attack he just slides off and I dont get to keep spamming it
maybe thats what im doing wrong
yoo I did the faron bomb boost
that was easier than I thought
the b button thing was the issue
Rain and I cleaned up the room some...how's the run?
Yeah two different words and urgency
Gohma dodging when she doesn't need to
Wait is it the male or female spiders that lay eggs...
Don't laugh lolz male seahorses have babies xD
alright ima start my next one when you go
yeah I just post myn in extention
cuz they dont have an ams channel
I was told every zelda game... Link is unreliable because he was sleeping lolz
where is the key you grab
I might start doing that one cuz bomb boost sometimes just sucks
Why did I hear "beat her board"
You said faster lolz and I said and more accurate lolz
I was staring at the movements wtf
Nah he doesn't like throwing it because of this reason lolz
Oh hey I've been dying to try one of thes... Hey, where's my reset? My reset?? MY DIET DR. BiT?
I forgot that was a thing...the events
This is how m2k felt lolz
Yeah...especially when you're use to trying to adjust because of the last controller
I gtg... phanto274GL with the no reset run and a very known phanto274GG
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
im always the first one here
ok then the pape max rando
we need fresh rando blood then
wasnt that during the covid period? live should be more fun
you math that? i just follow the shell
Welcome back to your personal hell
reverse all cards is a great one
What was your main in this again? All bosses?
Is it Wii VC that has an alternate method?
So just play on Wii VC EZ
I even have wii vc and I decided not to
Wait that was 3 years ago?
A failed any% attempt if you will
maybe pape is better on rrlat
i mean its better entertainment then a 100% nier automata run where 18 hours is friggin fishing
night slots aee usually for rpgs and long games yeah
you could also try for esa. it has 2 strims
no i mean. normally its filled with longer games like a final fantasy or an rpg
I always loved watching paper mario runs for the glitches
i bet you ff7 will get a slot in sgdq or agdq this year with the new glitches
i heard the new skip is crazy
ff10 is cool but its just too long. same for ff9 and ff8
FF12 TZA has x4 speedup for movement which is cool. makes the run a lot shorter
csr i dont like. it in my opinion makes the run less fun
imagine if you had a csr for mario galaxy. saves 8 hours on 242 stars
I think most modern games do
kingdom hearts did it well. it became a skill
yeah. I wanted to get into speed running Borderlands 2, but you have to downpatch to a specific version and that's a pain
they specifically patched speedrun glitches that made the run cool so everyone runs on an old version
oh the item duping that got patched and then even more broken
its great if devs come on speedrun events to witness how broken their stuff is and it blows their minds
dread is also very broken lol
I always appreciate developers that do that
if a glitch doesn't affect the casual playthrough, there's no point patching it
it probably impacting the casual gamer
im not sure what it is with ttyd but i feel it didnt age well
its a good game but some things are just slowpaced
i mean why do you have to do like 30 fights in an arena
I was playing the remake and got to the final chapter and was like "I don't want to play this"
is 7 the one with the pigs?
i think the funnest chapter is the train
true its all dialogue but its done quite well
as a casual right. as a speedrun its boooooooring
but to be fair id rather speedrun the train then the friggin glitz pit
im not sure how monado ever copes running glitzpit. gee i got bad rng rip 5 mins
this is still the better of the pape games
after they let go of the rpg element it went downhill
its nothing techy about it like sm64
isnt it weird. smb is a better platformer
shouldnt have started the pikmin 216 subset btw 😅
the set of that hack has a pay of debt and all treasures speedrun as part of the set
and its within half an hour of videos you an find, sooo fuuun 🙃
I just noticed, there a no enemies here when Jr. is there?
oh, and hi gl hf, btw
I ... don't think rando does that. I'll have to check
Oh, I can take a look
The ID shifting is so dumb, I regularly forget updating the generator and then suddenly some random partner is no longer considered progression
Annoyingly, how the item type system was implemented requires items of the same time to be clumped together in the IDs. And the partners have to be last
We do have the IDs listed in the generator's docs folder. But I forgot to update that for the latest release
I may set up a PR for the next version since IDs will shift yet again (yay..)
Well I do get it. If you're used to AP autotracking stuff, and a rando update breaks all tracking ...
heck, even I am annoyed with it
I think that's not AP generally, but the pape implementation. But yeah, bleh
im sure ill go bnack to the green
but ive gotten a lot of complements on the blonde
and a lot of my hairstylist friends (and one of my teachers) told me it works well with my skin tone so im having an idenity crsis
i did have split dye at one point
all i did when i got my hair done this time was move up the highlights and tone out the green. so im like an ICY platinum blonde
that solved that mental dilema for you didnt it
3 years of me giving you passive income
just say glenn sent you and theyll art for you
trusty keeps refusing my money its unfair
i had a lil drawing that i had her rush in like two days and she goes "oh its a bday present" like durl no
i bought her REPO as payment i guess
and i need to commission two emotes from her
I don't have any other slightly pikmin related emotes
I know rock pikmin dont exist in pikmin 2 but rockmin tippiTap
definitely got some meanie ones in the set, needs 2 playthroughs if you dont know the game in and out tippiTap but nothing you cant do easily
I can get a new CPU, Mobo, and RAM for $550
what cpu combo deal is that
mhhhh I'd rather the 9800x3d personally
I wanted the 9950X, but that one is $750
And I'm like... as nice as having 4 extra cores...
@Jonxhas This is a home server. X3D is a waste
But the extra 4 cores would have been nice... but not $200 nice
its something to do with how citra recompiles
its egregiously bad in hatsune miku project mirai DX, the game runs but its unplayable in emulator because the game itself is tied to framerate
the explanation of all the pikpik carrots being eaten does kind of trigger my adhd focus
is it bad i never played this game before?
this game is closest to pikmin 4
2 > 4 > 1 > 3 for me tippiTap
mostly cus pikmin 2 is just sooo much fun
sorry, my pikmin 2 funzone brain is gettin tickled big time rn tippiGiggle
this game is crazy because in the piklopedia louie writes instructions on how to cook all of the monsters
can't wait for the pickle jar lid
still kinda sad how the Wii version onwards said no to this
god this game is so immersive
but then kept other things in
i remember being a kid and being like OMG that was at the store!!!
also like - with all the trash for me when growing up, made me think more about not throwing shit away willy nilly, think about mow mmuch trash ya produce and such
i forget how you unlock louies notes
louie notes is once you eiher a) paid off the debt or b) get all treasures
you can turn the camera btw by pressing L to center it behind you tippiTap
damn it pulled it but too late
whats RA ? r u doing 100% of the game ?
The only way to master this one is to not play it
That was my nickname in college
Ah yes, you get the pikmin limit increase now
The Pikmin yearn for the flower
"clear the cave without losing any pikmin" > loses 1 pikmin
this is like a I accidentally left my game on to go get pizza
Oh I never knew they did that, that's neat!
its in animal crossing too but i forget where
good, finally got a pb in restricted BiT
barely missed sub 3 hour though so definitely going for that
but yeah pikmin 2 is a fun game
saorik2Tifa the onion just needs tifa from the italian senate
was lurking, laid in bed a majority of the day cuz neck was VERY sore
i played the Wii version of Pikmin 2 so i guess that irony didn't apply to me
i think you should reset yeah
idk that it saves every floor
doesn't have rewind like the remaster
it does auto save every floo
i mean tbf who would actually want an empress bulblax carcass? LUL
didn't you know theyr'e easily convertible into sleeping bags
i was so many days into this game that the boss was just absolutely depressed and had nothing new to say he was just like FML
"day 111 of not paying off our debt... i am completely lost all hope and im losing weight and my wife left me"
"can you just please do your job"
got myself an airfrier yesterday btw - things awesome tippiTap
when holding a pikmin in hand, Dpad left / right to cycle through the colors tippiTap
i really want an air fryer
i don't cook but i want one
I got mine 50% off for 40 bucks rather then 80 tippiTap
and gotta say: while the fries (which were also on sale for like 1.50 per kilo) are not up to snuff w belgium fries cus the people there make godlike fries imo
i can't eat potato anymore but id like to try air fried fish or chicken just no breading
I can only imagine it going real well
maybe even wrap it in foil
long enough or with enough turnin yea
foil wrapping I dont know, ya could do that though I reckon - an airfrier basically is a very compact oven
the foil would be to prevent the outside from burning before the middle cooks
also if ya need to have some oil on it, sparingly - the one I got doesnt like lots of that, if at all v sprayed on oil o like very thin layers
the benefit for me would be not having to use oil
just saying that if you got something which would still need it somewhat, you can reduce it LOTS
i can only really eat olive oil because im allergic to peanut, sunflower and grapeseed
i just hate not being able to eat fast food
I am thinkin of tryin frozen pizza, cut into pieces then stacked in the air frier PrideLaugh
eh - ofc I'd first let it defrost a bit
but like - I cant see it not being able to do that
but also like - that just means I gotta pay attention a smidge, keep an eye on whats going on and such
like - the big plus I give an airfrier rn: its compact, doesnt need heavy duty power cables or other big install costs
and it does well for imo up to 3 people if you take care of time well
plus like - for one or 2 ppl, its more then enough for normal food. if its for specifically baking a big cake, obv. tha wont hold up
totally not related to me being happy
THE tool to break pikmin 2 KEKW
not even to pass time rly
meant to be used if you are done at a direction to bring yourself back to base
so you'd keep like 2 pikmin, napsack, they'd carry ya back
which in turn if used in silly ways enables lots of jank
So with swarming (c stick) especially with only a couple Pikmin they will only target things you're basically directly touching
They will basically form a straight line. It's for navigation and not really targeting
With things like gates, walking up to them is fine and easier if you want to crowd quickly. Otherwise just throw them
wait, were those the purples you left by the ship at the base
im missing part of your head
is this the hardest rando possible?
Heya, gl hf! Are you on a rando break break right now?
Everything is on?? That's not good for the electricity bill
No hammers to now 2 hammers Sadge
Holy flag poles it’s a Phantom stream
i did this yesterday and forgot i didn't have parakarry, laki or ultra to get around the last wall LUL
a letter? i hope its a cool letter like the Q
The music and sound effects in this game are unmatched fr pepeJAM
I had burritos last night lol
I was about to ask for the invite but chicken tacos are beta NOPERS
didnt equip attack fx c. sadge
Love how the plushies are laid out today phanto274Smile
have you turned off full heals?
looking at old bot quotes and found... Phaotmgamesbot: Thhe audio is slighty desynced. Not sure if it doesnt matter for progression, but imagine having to do Kappa
i need a randomize pipe destinations option
thats why its low impact and still fun
I've lost all my duels today :(
Yes made it and what a wecloming
Meanwhile I just got my deck boxes
I just need to finish building my decks
Meanwhile I play master duel and mald
I lost the duel which means I lost my soul
That's not even Canon zeli, they translated die to losing their soul
It is canonical for the seal of orichalcos @swiftpichu_
Genuinely doesn't exist in the manga
Correct. Not a cannon. A seal
That's why it's called Seal and not Cannon of Orichalcos
It's so funny how unused the Orichalcos is in the modern game
Oh beautiful my screen froze in an ad
Orichcalcos is absolutely atrocious to play, same for the legendary knights
Only notable card is the retrain of that one card for blue eyes
And the card also says you forfeit your soul and therefore it IS canon to the tcg
@rgamer0 Because most decks need an extra deck to survive, and those who don't probably have a better archetype-based field spell
Or both, high kings for example
The best thing that Timaeus got was the retrain to make it work better for DM decks but it has problems still
The timaeus that's basically amulet dragon? KEKW
No I'm talking about Timaeus the dragon
As long as you run full dm you're fine, but the con is that you're running full dm
Even eye of timaeus sucks in DM
That reprint looks like amulet dragon gamer
Why would you need to search for it?
DM really needs some new support
Red-Eyes and Blue Eyes have way surpassed it
I summon Mommy, I mean Guardian Eatos
Oh that was a good joke
Because it kinda counts for both in that specific instance
It's more metalmorph support but it's decent red eyes support
Crystal king is 3rd on my faves
The new Red Eyes Metal Claw Dragon in the next set
Eh metalmorph and red eyes have always been correlated
The new blue eyes stuff is pretty decent though
The important thing is to just draw the out
I consider right now that DM is mostly relegated to Shining Sarco as of this moment
Which has starters out the wazoo
And why play shining sarc when you play millennium
And will be getting even more searchers in the next set
I mean in terms of DM
And I mean in terms of YuGiOh
I know that Millenium will be getting a new Gaia
That messes up synchro and XYZ plays
How come the new Gaia is millennium and not sarc?
How do you like it when all your monsters opposing Gaia have +6 to their levels
It's because it's a Grandpa card
Oh right gaia is from grandpa
DM is mostly just gone to Yugi at this point
And Yugi's deck is Shining Sarco
New DMG helps out shining sarco a ton by being another searcher
Makes me wonder when there's gonna be a new curse of dragon reprint
As well as a way to start plays
Oh no... Not my xyz plays... Anyway, link the circuit
Retrain CoD, Buster Blader and Magnet Warriors for Sarco pls
I feel buster blader himself is fine as is, but his pet needs a reprint
Funny that one of the current meta decks is a XYZ deck that relies heavily on Rnk4.spam
Again my current decks are Shining Sarco, Sky Striker and Maliss
When I read rank 4 I can only think of utopia
2 of my decks are link spam
They're the current top deck too
I'm dm, blue eyes and sky strikers
Shining Sarco is harder to build but next set will help them out a ton besides the new probably censored DMG
Bystials are finding spots to use as disruption
Magnet Trio. Level 4. ATK 1400 DEF 1000. If this card is normal or special summoned, add 1 "Shining Sarc" or a monster that mentions it from your deck to your hand. If this card on the field is destroyed by battle or by card effect, you can set one 1 "Magnet" trap from your deck. You may only use each effect of Magnet Trio once per turn.
And Bystial Maliss is the most popular use for them right now
I know it's old in tcg but it's new enough in MD
Since right now the top decks are light/dark
Enough that some people are asking for limits on Bystials because they're oppressing the current dark meta
what if i just want to active  runick fountain
What's the last BLS as of late? It's super soldier right?
@blacktiger51 you go fuck yourself because you're getting that shit negated
I feel likes BLS should get something in a bit
Right now DM needs more support
Red eyes and Blue eyes have enough for now
@SwiftPichu_ well shit summon  hugin add runick fountain active it AngyTwink
Blue eyes is the same that just released in MD right?
Only red eyes cards I would want in the future is a crossover with it and Flame Swordsman
Since right now the only thing that unifies Joey.dek is metalmorph
Maxx C is illegal in the TCG
Remember MD is a different format altogether
Go get copies of Fuwaloss that are like currently 100 bucks for a single copy
@Rgamer0 its allowed in master dual  ACTINUP
And I worry that Fuwaloss will be a short print in the next set
Tcg, ocg and MD are all different formats
Wouldn't surprise me gamer, it's why droplet is as expensive
Since it's one of the cards announced for Quarter Century Stampede
@blacktiger51 chain salamangreat charge, targeting ash, miragestallio, and gazelle.
I'm going to get a box of it mostly to try for alt art Raye
I'll probably get that for my birthday
I liked it more than raye personally
The alt art Shizuku since we're likely seeing that in the promotional anime for Sky Strikers
Since Linkage implies that she's going into Shizuku
Is there even a date for when they're releasing it?
Next month is when the first episodes will start
Meanwhile in Japan the current Rush duel anime will end for a GX remaster
@Zeliversal well shit you got me
So no new Yu-Gi-Oh Anime for a while
Better that way, I didn't like the rush series
Arc V was decent but rushed
But after that shit got fucked
That reminds me I should probably try to update my pend deck
I loved Arc-V before the anniversary shenanigans screwed it
@Zeliversal i had to look up charge i didn't know what that 1 card did KEKW
Ok. So judgement is negated. Charge resolves. I return miragestallio and ash, summon gazelle, called by resolves without effect as no target, ash negates Maxx c, circle resolves adding jack jaguar. But the IMPORTANT thing is that your runick fountain resolves YEP
Small Melodious engine to lead into the ZARC stuff
I forgot the new zarc exists
And that it's just that much easier to summon
2 Bacha are basically so easy to make to start into the ZARC stuff
Zarc is already super easy to summon. You just need 5 very specific cards in your hand.
It more or less is getting into the pend magician things using the melodious engine
how much i miss my runick spright deck in master dual its got hit a long ass time ago Madge
Since that was my GX era stuff
Cause it's not banned anymore surprisingly
lightsworn and dark world are my 2 fav old decks
@SwiftPichu_ 1 of the spell card is still at 1 irrc
runnable as in mid af YEP
You sure were excited to reach that door
Yeah shut the F8UCk up bot
Shooting star spam on the table
Welp, you got no power so might as well use all those shooting stars
Maybe he'll feel bad for you and give you a discount if you keep trading coins with him
surely that is how it works
Nah what we need is more shooting stars
this is gonna cost you 100 coins for breaking one, how could u
Are you gonna eat that? You went to the trouble of scrambling it
@blacktiger51 You should hop in MD NODDERS
@Zeliversal i haven't played for like 6 months
Time for a break from your break
Sooo Sushie Glitch into Tubba's for Train...yeah that checks
At least your done SNIFFA ing out stuff
rando is rando? who woulda thunk it!
Sometimes may be good, sometimes may be shit
(even tho I wasn't actually first lmao)
gl with the run or runs PrideFlower
pikmin 216 is kickin my butt tippiGiggle
When do you think you'll run more All Bosses?
rain told me he wasn't trying to beat the new no ace run cause he sucks at clippy too much
the funny thing is he's like 40s ahead of the new record early on and then loses so much
this just me rn or is twitch fuckin up for other ppl as well?
fuckin up how? is fine here
I'm always having issues on mobile
then a minute later, it reloads the stream - a different stream meanwhile no issues as far as I can tell
so ye olde "cant even try to debug cus its something fucky"
next best error code is error 3000 KEKW
those are the only 2 error codes i've ever seen
i wonder if it has to do with that FFZ bug i saw about
there was some new twitch experiment that broke FFZ and they tried to submit the new version and firefox did a dumb and rejected it or something
so if you run into that you gotta uninstall it and reinstall
i always struggled to get tampermonkey stuff to work idk if i'm just stupid or what
like people say to just copy paste this thing and then i do and it doesn't work lol
i was also getting error 2000 so i just cleared browser cache and signed back in to everything lol
yea i haven't been on here much either cause i only got home a few hours ago
Basing my assumption on the fact the first thing I heard upon joining the stream was "fuck man" I'll guess the run is going great
the last "new" game I played was Kirby forgor and before that was uhhhhhh
My switch has always been a dust collector
I played some random stuff on xbox game pass that might be newer? no idea lmao
I sold mine like a month ago
my brother moved out last year and he came here a month or so ago and took the switch
I only played like 4-5 games on the switch. tiny bit of origami king, bowser's fury, kirby, smash. that might be it lmao
i barely got anywhere in it. was not having a good time at all
I think you'll save a few seconds
I like how all the modern paper mario games, i've played less and less of them
I enjoyed Color Splash outside of it being way too easy and the boss fights being either literally impossible or completely trivial if you have the necessary item (which ig goes back to it being way too easy).
Finally almost built my sky striker deck, just needs one more Linkage and the main deck staples
Dragons as in Dragon Rulers, Blue Eyes or Dragonmaids?
Blue Eyes just buy 3x of the new Blue Eyes structure deck
back in highschool someone used a red eyes deck
Red Eyes is all over the place
Though now with the new Metalmorph support Red Eyes has some ability to function now
And red eyes gains a new metalmorph starter
It's the best version of the deck right now
the red eyes cards they did for Rush Duel or whatever it's called in japan look so fucking cool
Seems that Red Eyes is leaning towards the metalmorph stuff what with darkness metal dragon and now full metal dragon
After all metalmorph seems to be entirely Joey now
What with the latest metalmorph monster being a Flame Swordsman
So metalmorph is looking more to be modernjoey.dek
Has both red eyes and flame swordsman and even copycat
GX is getting a remaster anime soon after Go Rush ends in Japan
I doubt any modern cards for GX archetypes will be in the remaster
Since HERO and Yubel and Ancient Gears and Crystal Beasts and Arcana Force all got newish support
Supreme King Jaden pulls out his new ace Evil HERO Neos Lord
Gravekeeper got a bunch of fusions a while ago
Though with individual decks Marik has a bunch of Ra support, the less said about Ishizu the better because her cards helped to define the definitive tier zero deck and Odion also got new support recently
Like Odion now actually has a deck to play
Not just Apophis and Mystical beast serket and Temple of the kings anymore
Apophis are his trap monsters and he now has 3 of them
He now has a bunch of fusions too
and Anubis as a pseudo boss
Anubis also has a bunch of traps as well
He also has a card of himself in his own deck
Red Eyes Metal Claw Dragon also does the iconic Joey pose
Ok. Mr. Phantom. I discovered secret option #3 in my CPU decision
So the previous options were: CPU + Mobo + 32GB of RAM. 12-core 5.6Ghz for $550. 16-core 5.7GHz for $750
Secret option #3 I discovered... Spend $1100. Get two of the 12 core bundles. Now I have 24 cores total, and redundant systems
2 CPUs, 2 mobos, 2 kits of 32GB ram
Like, that way I can get both the benefit of the extra cores, some fault-tolerance on the important services, and it's still a good deal compared to the 16-core CPU
what curse have u flung my way Phantom
Livesplit just opened when your run died
it's called 'hammering the shit outta silver'
I have a vision, just need to execute
I'll send a pic in DMs since you're in prologue hell
the bush is shaped like this \_/
so it can go around below mario
yo pidge ty for the gl
ty for the good luck lopez
manual hammering of metal often leaves uneven edges sadly
what are you poweiring it with now
i mean like it's own brick or just plugged into something else
yo I come back to kitty! <3
Hello everyone. just got off work. hope everyones day is going well
it's an easy trip for me :D
we have to go back in a few weeks for mom's follow up
but yeah Boston is a labyrinth
he's too busy bein starstruck by his idol
I was so close to a 21:59 once but I threw
just need lucky coins and to not mess up
I just hit a fat pb
my 2 monitors have been mounted finally have space on my desk
domino's have stuffed crust pizza now been dying to try it
@blacktiger51 I believe you mean "will die if I try it" 4Head
Thanks Phantom. That made my night
I know how I can build you a shortcut
honestly, setting everything on fire would be better since paper burns fast
it would be a short story
But you have 3 hours to go
awh wasn't in spot number 3 3:
Yo goodluck Phantom! Controller still giving you issues today despite removing the input display?
that sounds easy to time SMILERS
Oh no why? Cause card lzs?
I'm sad so many of the fast tricks are LZS. It's defintiely not an approacahble trick to learn
And I agree, seems very loopeholey the way the definition is right now
That really isn't as bad as you'd think
I just wish the push wasn't so tedious even if it does eventually work
12 is good to know, I need to practice that a bit
How did u celebrate St Paddys day weekend?
yo amish ty for the gl
yo Lopez ty for the gl
Alright, who's going to discover a trick easier than BHS that makes it obsolete so I can never feel obligated to learn the quick way
should it be? since it beats the game?
I dunno, glundo gives a similar vibe to 5 golden liloinks
are there any games you run with a perfect leaderboard in your opinion
Is there like a max sword upgrades category?
dismount with b and just hold it EZ
Okay there, I've watched your minish cap runs lol
i don't like the star pieces at all
i do think 96 star piece is cool but the rest i have no problem with existing for the most part i think
but that doesn't mean i don't think they're dumb
some of these should get migrated back to a spreadsheet ngl
ah yes, a category that's entirely rng
nah doesnt have to be empty
that's when the retime would start yeah
not quite but it's pretty insane
Sounds like your next speedrun Phantom phanto274Smile
i think there were 9 non golds
i'm just gonna have to say goodbye to my pb
because twitch didn't save my 2 highlights of it
cause my stream cut out 2 and a half hours in
and mods approved it when i asked
the day i hook up my n64
or i start playing bomberman64 instead lol
@Iceblue uggghh fiiiine. i'll start the apocalypse
i didn't want to have to do this ya know
yeah the only reason i'll hook my n64 right now is to start learning BM64
Is this game a childhood classic?
I mean this game is over 25 years old now at this point right?
Damn it how did I get to be the youngin in the room
I remember this part, the 2 guards were talking about Tubba Blubba's weakness
you mean you don't speak fluent japanese after playing this game?
I woulda been 3 in 2001 lol
I was 6 and it was the first game I ever beat SMILERS
This dang bird shows up TWICE
wait what was the first thing you said?
I also basically only played Sony consoles as a kid so I always think of N64/PS1 era being only 90s and I forget that the N64 bled into the early 2000s a bit.
If it makes you feel better Ice I'm an old 29
Cause PS2 was 2000 but GC wasn't till 01
have they try buying a new tv Kappa
Look slike bootler really doesnt want anyone to enter the forest :O
i wish i could get wall mounted
Were gonna see Lady Bow soon! :)
and of course the model is on the back and a tv that big the mount isn't extending Clueless
@Phantom5800 Who's your favorite partner? :)
what's the rng on how many throws?
There's no arguing with Lady Bow, she gets what she wants
Lady Bow is lucky she doesnt have to get all sweaty when she's in the desert!
RUN FOR IT, ITS TUBBA BLUBBA :O
IDK. I prefer the desert cold
As much as it like physically hurt being there in the summer I would take it over minnesota summers lol
always over 100 dry is way nicer than 90-100 humid
Ok I hereby order deserts to be lukewarm
@Zeliversal If you had a machine that can control weather that is!
@adventureruler1 I don't need science. I have my declarations
Tubba's house is huge but it makes sense cause he's big too, so to him its normal size
shoulda waited for half a second so it woulda been 3:44:43 which is a palindrome at least
So those guys walking around the weapons are like Tubba Blubba's relatives or something? Cause Tubba doesnt seem like a king or ruler of any kind
I mean he owns a castle so he's gotta be somewhat important
Hmmm maybe he built it himself or he works and paid for construction workers!
Well we know one thing, Tubba is not very smart, he just destroyed a part of his own house
What's a little quick escape between friends
But Tubba is strong so hes gonna get through that door no problem
Those goombas need some fresh air they been in those tunnels for too long they turned green
they need to stay off the weed(uh) too
I didnt get to see streamer beat up Tubba Blubba :(
Oh haha i thought maybe you used an item or a partner ability
Where would you rather live? Tubba Blubba's mansion or Lady Bow's mansion?
Oh godddd not this annoying little brat again >:(
I thought you really lost! haha
Would Star Storm instead of a jump have saved you or do you need it next?
Hey streamer did you read my question about the mansions?
You have to choose 1 come onnnnnnnnn
I would choose Tubba Blubba because i dont want to live in a creepy forest :O
I would think Tubba Blubba eats alot so he has to poop somewhere
or kitchens even I don't think
Well he has a bedroom thats for sure, so he should have a kitchen and bathroom SOMEWHERE
I'm not buyin a 1 bed, 0 bath, 0 kitchen mansion lmao.
Even if its only 100 bucks?????????
Remember man you could always get those things installed later!
Now could you live in a desert tho? You might have to take into account what you'll eat
You should like speedrun mario 1 while this cutscene plays
or any game that takes less than 5 min to beat
Whats surprising is that out of all the characters in the Mario games that could've helped him get proper rest... IS THE GOOMBAS!?
How many gdq options will there be
surely this time glitchless will be in
Here he comes, the brat that never knows when to stop
i would honestly be down to derust and be a part of it
how would you relay it? every 2 chapters? or 1 chapter each and just cycle twice?
i think it'd be a given that lopez just does ch7 and 8 cuz of the mashing if we do spook
yeah i could do those, would have to practice them
she went to north desert looking for moustafos, I was there to help
and backing those up doesn't feel as bad as the clubbas
powerr bomb is the new fren LUL
I wouldn't mind doing the beginning if no one else wants to
im having a good time, i played 5 hours and then now theres spikey POISON boys, so i thought that was a good place to call it lmao
but I figured I'd take the end probably
if it doesn't get in we should just do it anyway with whoever is there
and idk maybe it would be more hype switching every chapter
yeah i said when we hit the second chapter title card i was like, damn, that took me six hours. Im pretty sure phantom would've beaten the game by now LMAO
3 is longer than 2 by a bit
9 person relay, just get a random member of the audience to do prologue, then 1 person does each chapter :P
oh phantom, im getting new dinning room table set today. My sister's work sold their model home so all the furniture must go
yeah i dont think audience participation would fly lmao
we would have to put the estimate to 6hrs cuz of just bowser alone
table and 4 chairs, barely used for $350
and its in a model so you know its nice
not a problem for spook COPIUM
they should let you airlift bosses after a certain amount of dmg dealt tbh
bro cant even pluck a flower
The Koopa Bros thought they were slick too
this is very interesting to watch now that I've played through this part, I'm pretty sure it took me an hour and a half to get there
and you already know where to go
Why wouldn’t Kooper be wearing a shirt? KEKW
Oh I didn’t know the plot LUL
These little pests are pretty good at this
Whoa! Twilight Princess! I love Zelda! <3
I wasn’t paying attention I thought you were doing another rando lmao
i also really need to practice tp, but i have no idea what current settings everyone is practicing rn and also how 1.3 development is going
i want entrance rando already dangit
I also added some emotes for peaches like AngyTwink MarioDumpy PeachO NotTheRun
also yes AngyTwink is adorable i love them
That’s scary precise for such a long run damn
Just steal it from road NODDERS
Mario was too poor to continue
It'd be funny if there was a canon bad ending for every single way a run could end lol.
so just action replay 50 attack to Mario and boom you win easy in 4 minutes.
I like that the last split is "Hold b for siz minutes"
oh you can kill him tho? lmao.
is it quicker to not defend?
I know what it is LUL
oh yeah I forgot that was a thing
also cant block until we meet twink
yes lol, i did fight goomba king, i assumed it was mandatory?
no he's talkin bout the pro strats
i got no  idea what the strats are to tell yet lol we shall see
why didnt you tell ME about this axl???
i wasnt there for your first stream lmao
yeah you were, idk how long but you was there pretty -
home DEPOT is on DOOR DASH?
What about IKEA is that on there too?
good greif, i thought my delivery service was odd enough hacing gas stations lmao
I can do 7/11, but i mean like, actual gas stations
was slicing limes at work, now I've this craving for tacos
That crash site is going to need ALOT of worker toads to fix
your tacos were the final blow, definitely thought of 'em while craving Mexican cuisine
but what if you die how are you supposed to continue your progress!?
i used to work at dominos and as a result i can never eat it again
then all your runs are you sum of bests
"How can Phantom avoid getting soft locked economically?" Ah, the dreaded economic soft lock. It’s like being stuck in a loop of poor decisions and dwindling resources. Here’s a thought: maybe try not spending all your coins on things like overpriced fright jars and life shrooms. Invest in something more solid, like a speedy spin. And perhaps steer clear of shady salesmen offering "great deals". You know the guy or, you know, just reload a previous save file of life choices. Cheer100
I could splice a mid 3:37
yeah just with my sum of best
i probably will i'm just lazy lol
always blamin it on the cartridge, just rng manipulate better, duh.
if you were just good and got to that room 5 seconds earlier, you coulda gotten the key before the koopa dropped the gate NotLikeThis
The greatest character in the entire universe defeated by a flight of stairs.
you can kill prologue bowser like we talked about :P
it'd be funny if killing him warped you to chapter 8 hallway bowser.
@LordLevias19 Thanks for the gift sub!
oh you can't use hammer even tho you have it
I just showed up and see crash screen what happened
no glitches in logic wha is this
fair do you just not feel like thinking about glitches
did you at least change it to minimal cutscenes from shortened because didn't S1 have shortened
I think they updated the preset yeah
sister texted me, she'll be here in 20 minutes. I responded with POGGIES. She went to google it LUL
i am return i was forced to run an errand
i see we gave up on that tun too lmao
sub 5 go mode lfg :P
but yeah parents needed me to run to the pharmacy so i got myself a sweet treat while i was ther
youre just not having a good pape day clearly
there's a 3 musketeers anime wtf???
theres a sherlock anime for crying outloud
Is that the number of times chatting and not being first?
There's no total streams watched data?
twitch has it, it shows in your monthly recap if you sub
so this guy took me forever ti find
i misread trhat he was in the city and i was runnin garound in the desert in all the top areas because he said "keep going up" and i kinda skipped the rest
axl had to tell me he was in the city, i got the rest lmao
uhh i got the music note, and kinda got lost for a bit
what happens if you say youre mario to that guy
i said luigi on instinct but i am curious
... that would've been incredibly funny why did i not do that
lazy ass Boo, throwing the weight outside the mansion
"Want this dusty cake I found in a haunted mansion?" YES
literally just bought eggs, $9 for 24
this is not a joke, in the last few weeks the most confiscated item at the us/can border is americans trying to bring in eggs from canada
as eggs are literally now cheaper to buy in the cursed canadian currency
and also we have alot of them
aparently y'all are low on eggs and are now asking germany for eggs??? i Guess??
@peachedpocky I can believe that. It's what we do with insulin, go to our neighbors who charge reasonable prices for that shit
eggs are simple but have a lot of flexibility and utility, so they're busted
I never have eggs by themselves really but there's a lot of things I eat that use eggs as an ingredient.
I mostly use 'em for breakfast sandwiches and omelets
a cobb salad sounds good rn ur right
but also if im going through the effort to hard boil eggs im making cream eggs on toast
I have this tiny skillet, literally for frying eggs.
@buff00n i find those funny bcuz like, how small is your burner that you can get away with that
@peachedpocky burner's average, but setting it to 1 / 2 out 6 is more than enough flame to cook in the thing
@buff00n ah, a gas stove, that answers it then. I have a coil stove. There is no smaller lamo
Had a coil stove in an apartment and I hated that bloody thing
did you just do a weird clip into that wall?
That pinned message sounds like GamesBot's gonna cook some frog legs, or something
oh come back to a rando
well if that idea of a 9 person relay goes through i know what chapters you wont be signing up for lmao
yeah i don't blame you ch1 sucks for a speed run
"Who wants to run a Pape Relay?" *raises hands*
oh hes just there in spirit
I am here with a fuck yeah salad to bless the rando
sometimes u just gotta stuff a buncha greens in ur face (not St Patrick's Day)
what was it? I was busy with my salad
oh we got kooper? was putting ice cream back in freezer lmao
everyone's got the need for monch
oh not all chapters scaled to 8?
that shooting star item is very handy lmao
YES HE IS REAL AND CAN HURT YOU
Peaches, elec attacking and explosion will instantly knock down the tower
yeah for me by that part of the fight i had already used all my fp lmao
S0 was the only preset with it open iirc
I wonder how much chap 1 scaled amayzees would give
rich in honey dipped shrooms fatpidTHONK
That thing Lakilster threw is really good!!! :O
" Fuck those Yoshi kids " - Phantom
The Yoshi kids getting in to trouble once again huh?
@adventureruler1 if they got themselves in, they can get themselves out
Power of salad 🤝 power of weed
@buff00n BUT THERE JUST CHILDREN :(
( S I G H )
fast food does not go into the fridge
oooo those spike tops look fantastic
I cannot throw stones, my younger brother has thrown McDonald's straight into the fridge, without even eating any of the food
is multibonk fixed in rando or is it trash still? Or both :P
he's also done that with microwave popcorn
@buff00n STRAIGHT TO JAIL FOR YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER
I legit opened the fridge to find a fully popped, unopened bag of microwave popcorn
was it like, butter??? was it planned for toppings or st??
cause if it was butter? STRAIGHT TO JAIL DO NOT PASS GO
w. why would you pop it if you weren't going to eat it immediately
@trustyaltruist I don't bloody know, so I couldn't tell you
I can see popping popcorn for like a candy coating but like
this chat has now become r/peoplegettingreallymadatfood
but like. microwave popcorn just goes stale quickly. you have to pop right before eating
why would you pop if you weren't gonna eat it is my question
I guess it also kinda is me cause I have Food Issues :X
maybe you changed your mind mid pop? idfk
I would use an ice item against him cause he's a fire type enemy
also also, he's thrown empty plates / cups into the fridge
listen if I get soapmouth or Bad Texture midway through eating I power through that shit
I'm just assured your lil bro definitely was high in these instances
fwiw, I'm like 13 years older than him
That's about the average age gap between me and my own brothers
@FatPidgeyBirb as far as I know, he doesn't. He is on the spectrum, tho
omg Kolorado walking off sadly mid-way
@buff00n I'm on the spectrum myself (points to previous food related issues) but like. SQUINTS
Phantom softlocked their room and trapped parakarry in it
can't come into work today, I'm softlocked int my room
that actually happened to me today
got trapped in today from snow
I'd like it to be april already
damn, no food or nothing ?
@FatPidgeyBirb I too, would like to see the Switch 2 Direct
I just am sick of fake spring I would like Real Spring
it was like 65 degrees in my area, more fake spring, please
so I can have regular depression instead of seasonal depression
it's been 50 and rainy and I'm waiting for when we get sucked back to the 20s
The dog didn't deserve that!! You monster!!
I'm telling Chucky and his eevee siblings
yeah, my cat does that on occasion
it one of the few times I've seen the bastard actually drink water
Not so ominous now huh TutanKoopa? >:)
do you have  a fountain bowl for your cat then, buff00n
Does ur cat also enjoy drinking from running faucets?
@FatPidgeyBirb I have not tested this
📝 if ur cat enjoys running faucet water, I'd consider the fountain bowl
Antiguy is not really a bad guy
@FatPidgeyBirb We had to get our orange tabby a faucet shaped fountain because he refuses to drink of anything else
orange cats have a single braincell dedicated to food, attention or murder
only one of those at a given time
from my orange tabby experiences they definitely behave differently from other cats and I'm not sure why
@SeventyFourTG the running witch joke answer is that it's a soul on its first life so it has no idea what it is doing
when the ice fishing goes wrong
How else are they supposed to get their drinking water?
from a faucet like a civilized penguin
I like the song of the snowy mountains
is it just me or do gulp its remind you of quagsires
A comfy bed near a fireplace <3 Just amazing!
Well now you don't have to go to 3!
if ya want it chat, all ya gotta do is guess correctly
sure, I'll toss a casual 10k in
with that prediction I'm down to 66.6 points so I need this prediction to be wrong
Healthy pot this time around, who will win it all?
I had 155k then I spent 25k
Wow, yeah I have half that
I'd have less if I could make u play Celeste 😏
I might have spent more and/or actively watched less
I also don't win anything on gambas since I'm usually running them
Just gift me a sub marioman
if the frying pan is a key does that count for gamba
Oh I totally misread the gamble
I thought it was how many were in Tubba's Castle
I'm not, I imagine most of chapter 3 hasn't been checked yet
how much was triple dip? more?
ik it was cheaper BP but yeah didn't see FP
Does that mean 0 wins the gamba?
omg Im cracking up. Banjo Kazooie has a category called NoPOG% I fucking cant!! For real tho it mean no pause overlap glitch so no note dupes
guess I'm DQ'd from the leaderboard
Yippee hunt for the last key
well I maintain that I won the bet since that's what I thought the bet was on so yeah.
Wild goose chase of a seed
Now to save up for a plando seed
We are raiding in with frogs abound?
You know it's okay! We are raiding in with frogs abound! Seasoning with some mates, if that's what caused it, everyone had that before
You know it's okay! We are raiding in with frogs abound! Seasoning with some mates, if that's what caused it, everyone had that before
How much do early resets mess with that avg?
yeah cause it's an average of each split not an average of each completed run right?
whats wrong with 3 minute cutscenes
followed by back to back dumb ass tricks that end your run instantly if you're playing any%
Sunshine ik is also awful with unskippable starting cutscenes.
what makes totk bad is just the fact its long and you have multiple run ending tricks immediately lol
but thats just wr pace so most people probably dont reset
I think "Being human" is probably something you should stop doing if you wanna be as good as tas
is that the fastest attack he can doi
I also have to deal with this asshole streaming
bros the type of person to dm you saying "yo check this banger sound track out" and its just a play list of green noise
wtf is green noise? is that like environmentally friendly white noise?
"Green noise amplifies mid-range frequencies with uniform intensity. Green noise sounds are perceived as similar to ocean waves or a stream."
getting shot on the roof sounds like a CoD problem
what the hell is this I’m tuning in and Lopez is doing glitches? phanto274S
gl all! great to hear m4 again too
but does the half frame save cause you to be frame misaligned now
Mr Phantom, did you know that you can easily win at Paper Mario by removing all the plants because Nintendo uses plant based ink YEP
Yeah and then Jess projectile vomited in dreaded's room
Darn at least im here for endgame
DId both ur march madness teams make it in?
we used to for final way before my time
or like close but the current safe fight has potential to be very fast
buff hope ur spring week is goin great
I think I'm trying not to get sick. Throat's been feeling parched the whole day.
I don't like playing Paper, said the person submitting Paper
just drink during all the cutscenes
I see your in the part where Peach disguises as the guards! >:D
If you were to give Peach a cardboard box and a tranquilizer, she could be Solid Peach of Metal Gear LOL
Wait i forgot, how did Kammy Koopa figure out that was Peach??
Was it because that green guard is supposed to be protect the outside gates and the Koopatrols are the indoor guards?
Hey that could be it! haha
He's the Andre the Giant of Clubbas, he just never stopped growing.
I personally think it would be kinda rude if Mario didnt say hello
I wanna know the physics of how spinning makes Mario move faster in a straight line.
Who do you like more? Kooper or Koops?
Oh no looks like the race is decided
when your p up and d down bawkGasm
new p-down d-up route in the works.
just duplicate p-down d-up for more attack reduction.
isn't that all speedrunning games lmao.
I got a really cool doggy bandaid on my hand
random encounters are never not annoying.
I dropped a pallet on my hand at the end of my shift and it took a chunk of skin lol
I didnt feel anything and then I got back to what I was doing inside and noticed my glove was entirely red
We were out of bandaids in my dept so I took my hairtie out and just tied tissues to my hand lmao
equip both p-up d-down and d-up p-down for perfect balance.
Did you know that you can easily beat Paper Mario by removing all the trees because then they can't make paper?
the only 4 doors in the entire castle.
time to start a new run rn so you can hold B during prologue and hold B during this at the same time!
I think he just posted a PB on BSky too
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
fun stream, have a goodnight everyone!
pretty good just trying to platinum the game i am playing
I'm close near the end on nightmare difficulty
Isn't Digimon celebrating its 25th anniversary or something
I got that in sweater variation
ugh fucking missables stuff in my jrpg SadgeBusiness have to do another run
i been following a guide too
its does count what i already did so its not that bad
afaik you can set up discord to use such a button, no?
maybe its a weird "oh yea I only work on mobile" thing
hold on imma peek settings rl quick
so desktop discord HAS a "show send button" setting
but it doesnt specify if that then takes priority over hitting enter or not
lemme test rl quick in dms w ya cus curious
there's also a "use legacy chat input"
now that my gf lives with me i have to actually go outside sometimes so maybe we'll plan for it
k both of those dont solve the issue of "enter sends message"
yea okay then accessibility definitely has ya covered
cus the send button shows up on the line end of the chat textfield PrideFlower
ye i think she'd be down. she really likes cons and events
full glitch logic would go hard (with a vetted seed)
my white cat figured out he likes going for walks outside
so now hes been standing by the door meowing every half hour
the first couple times he was unsure and didnt like the harness
but something clicked this week lol
oh yeah guess what. I reached 1 million channel points in beest channel. im shocked but not surprised it took that long disregarding my 3 month break last yr
peach is so stupid, just hide under the desk idiot
heading out for dinner awsm time and stream
Took me a minute to realize this isn't a rando
I only tend to leave if the vibes don't feel right
some ppl do that - hype and such
its like how for big sports events, if the favourite team in say soccer or baseball or whatever, exchange for the topic you wanna think of
if the team or person in question they hype up is not doin their best in their eyes, viewership on those things also fluctuates lots
its that general behavior but related to speedrun WR hype chase basically
well I cant put "grind for wr"
ye olde "look youtube I was here"
"look mom I'm on TV I WAS THERE" mentality sorta thing
the only time in ahead of wr in A<S
I entered snow peak like 30 seconds faster than WR
and then it goes down hill from there
it's not lying as long as you're trying to get world record, doesn't matter how unlikely it is lmao.
Maybe you'll skip 1:13 and be a legend :P
so I dont see that happening
im currently implementing nimzo's advice I read
fuck eggxecute recruiting in PMD red rescue team btw
(it was a streets 1:12 reference lmao)
running howling forest for the last floor on a 1% spawn chance (recruit chance comes afte)
he was saying like "you should choregraph your movement" while tlaking to someone else
cus I refuse to wish cave it
and I was like thats a good idea
if i feel like im winging movement maybe I should make that something I can muscle memory instead
That dude is my mood on the daily
Lookong forward to seeing it NODDERS
just play perfectly and you'll WR ez.
me when I simply make no mistakes
but is more RNG dependent I presume?
isn't that just a majority of speed run strats
you do all them frame perfect inputs and shit to save like 3 seconds, fail 1 time lose 20
That’s too much RNG that’s bs
I mean that's all RPG speedruns I feel like
or at least turn based ones.
good ol' "rng in rpgs during runs" odds of finishing a run
what about 2 3caps though KappaPride
memories of a "3 cap me u wont" clip
yeah Pokemon is up there for worst RNG speedruns.
There was some game where there's like an item that increases your movement speed but it only has like a 2% chance of showing up in a certain spot so the speedrunning community literally modded the game to make it 100% cause it was so stupid. I wanna say it was Bioshock Infinite iirc.
but I might be wrong lol.
hill runners hat, variety runs bioshock infinite on console and doesn't use mods lol
its a 1/50 chance that decreases with each retry since the item pulled is removed from the pool
it increases your move speed by 50% for 5s each time your shield breaks, so the strat is low health + constantly breaking your own shield for the speed boost
yeah its a neat strat but fuck a 1/50 -> 1/49 -> etc., it's also not consistent spawn positions so you can either reload for the 1/50, or not try the 1/49 until like 8m later
I just recorded my 3rd sgdq submission seed for z1r
waiting for the others to finish theirs so we can compare and get them into our restreamer
yeah we're trying to get one that's decently close
seed 1 would of been good, because 3 of us were within 2 minutes of each other. 1:11, 1:13, and 1:14
yeah i was in the crowd front row lmao
we're trying to see if seed 3 will be better
now it's just up to Crim to restream it, with our 2 commentators, and get us our submission
we reached out the gc for some kind of advice on submitting it
and it was just such a fucking dismissive answer
crim typed up this entire like huge doc
and let them know we were submitting, and asked for advice
and court was like "ty for letting me know, gl on submission"
thanks for letting us know you didn't read it
the ONLY time i asked for feedback
"Thank you for using our submission feedback form! Regarding your request for feedback on your Zelda II: The Adventure of Link run, we do not feel that there was anything inherently wrong with your submission. Zelda is a competitive category of runs, and we picked other games for this marathon. We encourage you to keep submitting in the future."
what's the point of offering feedback
if you aren't gonna give feedback
it's why i just stopped submitting z1m1
oh yeah ice i'm with you there, i got the same feedback the first time i submitted and i was like fuck that
i also confirmed my theory a few submissions ago
they don't watch the submission videos
i already knew that, unlisted and 0 views got feedback for me that time too lmfao
and it didn't gain views over the entire course
"ur video was fine, it was cool and stuff"
yeah it was the same shit ice said earlier "zelda is competitive! we felt like taking other stuff this time around yada yada"
"we liked how you pressed the button on time"
that's why i'm caring so much less about my submission videos this time
i'm gonna put effort into TP AD and that's it other than just recording something
just submit pbs half the time
yep, gym just submits pbs too
probably why i don't get in mostly
i submitted mostly pbs, some hotfix stuff
i also believe the gc hates me after i went off on them lol
i told you about that phantom, right?
there's absolutely a popularity contest with the gc from what i've seen lol
they accepted both of us, i emailed them asking if it was a race, cause it wasn't labeled
and was told it was a "mistake, and vanni was the main runner, and i was backup"
Does Zelda II qualify as an awful game? :P
after i had been submitting it for literal years
and vanni got raided the gdq previous playing it casually
so i went off on them lol
@Darkness3827 It's not an awful game though?
its not silly block awful I guess
Zelda 2 is a more popular speedrun than z1 lol
vanni was playing bs zelda casually, and he got the gdq raid. they egged him on the learn it and submit
so step 1, become besties with gc
and after 3 years of me submitting it, we get it in, and they were like, he's main runner
vanni is vanni_van the RPGLB guy right?
like, i love vanni, but man that boiled my blood
i'm submitting with z1r community for a 4p race
ye, it is what it is at the end of the day, shit can go wrong without you fucking up anything
i'm working with the creator of zelda tilt and tumble. he's gonna create an intro vid for me
Keiz has been submitting bn2 since he was top 3 lol
i think my goal by the agdq submissions is to have 2 more games to submit cuz i don't wanna have tww on there often
i hate the gc too, so feeling is mutual LUL
yes can you remake sewers, Phantom.
TPR was like the 3rd or 4th time it got submitted, everytime but the one it was accepted it was gym/pheenoh
the time it was accepted, obv it was gym/spike
but man, i'd love to see new faces on the stage
i've never gotten a chance to talk to him
im gonna agree with you ice, new faces would be amazing
like, there's literally someone who has a twitter bio that's like "26 time gdq runner"
dawg, please pick someone else lol
i can name drop if you want
Spike is to GDQ what Conan is to awards shows
I mean it's on their twitter bio not like it's info they're tryna keep private lmao.
it's just... holy hell, pick someone else and get some new faces lol
oh i went back to check
i will say, reading that does discourage me from ever submitting anything to a mainline event
he's the guy that i saw post a cheeky "unless they just wanna give me my own block..."
i read that and was like
on that note, i love gym, good friend, but also it was nice to not have him on stage last event lmfao
oh and i swear to god
if i see another 9 person kaizo relay
why do they even like kaizo so much
It sounds like a community club at this point with card holding members drinking cocktails
kaizo's boring as hell, i don't see the appeal personally
it's cool, but the content is getting dry
but kaizo is SMW and SMW is super big... CorgiDerp
now MM2 troll stuff these days is funky
kaizo was cool like 13yrs ago
the mm2 stuff isn't even that great
Kaizo when it was new is cool
yeah kaizo is funny for about 2 minutes then just boring.
let's see how much dumb shit i can slap on a level
Now it ain't new so now it's just boring
look at me, i put 39820349 buzzsaws and spinys!
Like a good puzzle level would probably be worth it
oh yeah danny's idea is kinda sick
honestly hear me out: since SM64 has a maker thingy mod, ya COULD create funny stuff for that
its far out there for sure
but like... I feel like thats just shifting the silly
tbh, i'm also sick of sm64 too lol
i can't wait for METROID DREAD TO GET IN AGAIN
nah the OoT they're gonna take is my OoT any% with my feet or whatever dumb incentive i pick
@Iceblue it's 64 rando they keep putting in right, i cant remember
i'm literally gonna eat a stick of dynamite
just stopped watching that game at gdq's
that game is so fucking bland
have they ever done a MG dread run
need those gba metroid games in there
submit dread for awful games :P
yo a fusion run would be sick
it's a good game, it's just a tired speedrun already
cause it's literally been run at like 4 gdqs already
yeah it's been sm64 nonstop stuff
sm64 nonstop is so fucking dumb, idc
zero mission was last agdq 2021 low%, that'd be cool to have another zero mission run
i love that game but man it sucks outside of vanilla
and i guess the new ironmon thing or whatever it's called
i can't wait for them to submit sm64 with the "new route" since they discovered the sign clip
yes you save 4 seconds getting 1 star
bro but you can clip through the floor now instead of clipping over the wall
@Iceblue and then they fail it Kappa
I'd watch a 0 A press run
they already did that with a TAS
Watching a platform rise for 82 hours is boring!?
if i wanted to watch TAS videos, i'd go to the website lol
if there is something i wouldn't miss its super metroid
I meant RTA 0 A press
i'd rather watch someone burn a stack of SM64 carts instead
TASbot is great when they can do wacky stuff like that Brain Age run
"fire department speedrun, how quickly do they respond to this fire alarm"
Or crazy impossible out of bound sstuff
But otherwise not actually that interesting from a viewer perspective imo
who will be the brave runner to submit toy story 2 100% to gdq
If I was into programming or something I might enjoy it more
i'm gonna go play taiko for 12 hours instead
Probably need a proper rival to GDQ at this point if it's a gentleman's club of whose who
i fucking love toy story 2 KEKW
What's the max length for a game to get in?
they just don't really accept long runs anymore
Oh sorry I thought we were still on Toy Story 2
shoutouts to that guy that submitted brothership when it first came out and
it was a fucking miracle we got MM hundo in and i think it's only cuz it was a relay
it was a 12 hour estimate
what do you mean, sway's pb is like 9 and a half hours
morph are you going to sgdq?
Games Too Long should be a thing then
Close :) They restocked the cheaper mobo I was looking at so now it's only $650
that's what they haev RRLAT for
I will probably make a decision like Thursday or Friday since that's the last day I'll be close to the store
@Iceblue gonna try my best to
if this glitchless relay we're submitting gets in, then yeah
we HAVE to order 5am taco bell
they have a 24h taco bell
maybe boomer any% in mm isnt so bad
have you submitted yet phantom, im just gonna submit my pb
i need to get my submissions in
i think 3:50 is perfectly fine tbh
not a hard game to derust so that's super realistic
z2, zelda tilt and tumble, z1r, and bn2
you have like 6 hours coming up
so i just checked my hurricane pb
nah I'm more of a shrinker
i got 4 capped on laki :)
Need to make something else tonight that isn't fried rice
4 cap laki is traumatic for some reason
Next step in my fried rice journey is to get some sambal to increase the heat of it
and the first thing i saw
"submitting MM2 relay with teh gamers to SGDQ, gonna be a good time"
if mm is so good why isnt there an mm2
just gonna go fuck off to the practice room
Oh wow Phantom went from down a minute to up 40 seconds in the peach intermission! How impressive.
Good afternoon! I don't know how you figured out the correct cooper... probably speedrunner skills
That Luigi just seems so trustworthy... how could you not believe your own brother?
just gold by a minute and you can almost PB :P
It better finish with good rng or my 100 points back!
I have yet to play any of the paper mario games. Always avoided them as a kid, because I wanted my Mario to be made of organic material not paper
paper is an organic material technically :P
Rip, I hate when my monitor is in front of direct sunlight
do a blindfolded speedrun and then the sunlight won't matter :D
just working on my next game idk if  I'm going for platinum or not
I'm playing tunic again i want to try to beat it without god mode end game is bullshit
you should play tunic in the next AP, it has grass sanity with around 6000 checks. It isnt bad tho, ive had people in my group finish it in like 2 hours
YEP you cant read texts unless its on the in game manual the fox don't understand it
@Axl_SR let me think about that um no
i do not have the pc version and game is bullshit hard
i did had it on gamepass
i do recommend you play it
i have pape races tthis week but i really dont wanna do them
just trying to rip the bandaid off
best of luck, honestly speedrun events have lost their luster for me tho
do you find SS rando interesting?
like my top 5 speed games could get in and i prob still wouldnt watch it lol
This is my new favorite shadow
yeah lots of people said that
Nothing happens it didnt need to exist lol
fragments was good but that about it
why wouldnt a dog battling cancer not get in phanto274Smile
can always mix in a couple days of that
I was just vibing after solasta ln
I saw it but didnt join anything
how far have you gotten in prime?
yeah ive been busy lately anyways
hope all is well, gl on the run or runs depending
also: fuck eggxecute. stupid coconut pile still avoiding me
between thursday and saturday multiworlds amongst other stuff like league races. Ive given up on the idea of being here for every prime stream. Just play it whenever you are able and ill make the ones I can.
make a hack save like what sunshine has
yeah, for obvious reasons ive been looking into banjo stuff
i asked my gf if she'd wanna go to sgdq and she immediately started planning for it
i do think youd enjoy it on AP once you learned the maps and checks
so very likely ill be at this one
plus it runs on hardware, so no bizhawk
or does the lag really irritate you?
Ive seen areas give like 10 fps in tooie on console lol
turn turn the camera to the wall and it goes away
yeah we're driving up Tuesday evening
if a pape run doesnt make it im bringing protest signs
leaving early am to get there and have time to chill
I'm planning on leaving Saturday morning unless run gets accepted for Saturday
@realblopez that drive usually takes me about 6.5 hours, I feel your pain
yeah I hate coming home late and going to work the next day, need that extra day to chill
i have to drive 90 minutes i feel your pain :tf:
That's pretty bad I'd have to drive 60
I used to live in MN back in the day
MN has a good amount of speedrunners i feel
would've still been a 4 hour drive tho
but might be biased bc i dont pay attention to other states
I used to be a speedrunner back in the day...
komari says he's returning to bn6, surely he can find a betterr use of his time right?
when I submit stuff that's checked by default lmao
I think JCog and Giga lol
I think it used to be just Giga as supermod until a couple years ago
I think the biggest joke in this title is finish
Whoever is reading this, not that V, the other one
Oh yeah how does this change from US to JP?
japanese makes it kinda hard to follow the story
The Quest for Mistakeless Gold: A Speedrunner’s Story
It would be a fun project for sure.
Never seen it on spreadsheet but I’ve seen a few other Mario gamers do theoretical best videos using WR and former WR best time clips.
One day I’m going to have to actually play this game. The randomizer looks incredibly fun so maybe that will motivate me to learn.
I know what a good lz time is rather than knowing what the split will be
but in ch1 it's the opposite
But pokey... one could say it's bad
Wait no I shouldn't say that..
I'm gonna just forget the joke of on paper on mario
on paper it's easy to forget
Nah pokey...my dad passed so it kinda got...yeah
My own fault lolz it was impulse
I don't have any other jokes tho
I'm just use to saying "dude" for everyone
Will you ever play sonic adventure 2?
Why am I getting 2 ads about taxes
I did my taxes why did I get 2? Lolz
Gonna see it until the end of april
Gotta pay the pet tax it seems...our dog won't stop staring at me for more junk food
anecdotally I feel like I get it more often than not
but not sure like how much, maybe 75/25
would be interesting to see what my rate on that is
I gotta head out... phanto274GL with the rest of your run Phan
hello hello! i hope runs are goin well!
kitty being mischievous? (i assume,, its a cat?)
doesnt understand the fans desire to see him
it’s an orange cat, they don’t know why they do half the things they do LUL
my cat likes to think he is leading me around the house, only to walk into everything in his path in the process
he knows the snacks are there
but people go in… come out with food. how get in?
Wowowow it’s Phantom the S tier ghost phanto274GL
my cat yodels into a wall corner. I think he likes the acoustics.
he’s very strange but love able.
my parents have the biggest cat and he loves to climb onto your shoulders and lay across the back of your nack
Imagine it’s RNG if you can beat it omg KEKW
Damn shatter you got thrown under the bus KEKW
If Needed I Can Perform a Ritual Sacrifice
Ok, if good rng did Not work
My apartment isn’t accepting e-transfer anymore NotLikeThis
I have to go in person with a pre authorized debit payment now idk why they’re being complicated
i cant believe you learned japanese for this run
I don’t even have a debit card so I’m a little fucked I think KEKW
I used to but I lost it lmao
Yeah I have a credit card
I tried they’re being complicated NotLikeThis
I got like 2 and now neither work. it’s a whole thing
i would reset if i fucked that up, mostly as a matter of principle
fave huff puff 💨 wins today
shit hold up don't greet me just yet i got ads
I have 12k reward points POG
Are you calling me poor Madge
ok ads are over you can say hiiii :3 back now
fuuuuuck!!! i HATE it when my speed runs explode
@Midnaliin my fingers are locked on my amount
@stavros12c34anenoglou spill the tea you won’t
run's dead you encountered monstar. you just die
if nobody got me i know inaccurate livesplit estimations got me 👍
GL and make sure to have fun
So… you’re saying there’s a chance
Btw where is luigi in this game? I can't seem to find him
oh my god its luigi :D
Pb is-a dead but the fun is still alive-a!
I'm trying to get better at my marioness
Is the end boss still bowser or did nintendo made a fun and interesting boss for this game specifically?
you can always gold door 2
imo any gold is a good gold
mega shock 2 turn saves like 6s as well COPIUM
still better odds and faster than a natural 2 turn lol
only a week away from new nintendo switch 2 deets! excited? i cant wait to speedrun a new 3D mario
thats all cool! im usually PM64 and TTYD and SM64
i cant wait for mario kart 8 to rerelease
If it’s not Mario kart Wii we don’t want it MadgeRn
kart customization is so dumb especially because ~~theres just One Optimal Kart~~
why not?? don't you wanna just yell 'vore me daddy bowser' after a good 3 and three-quarter hours?
Mario fr praying for the run
Wait how do we access the poll lol
i trust you'll take us somwhere awesome lol
and you not gonna tell us are you KEKW
1 is pope i am guessing
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
have a great rest of your day!!
easier if you time the spin imo
I think still faster if you swap to para
you skip oasis and upgrade bombette in red station
yeah I only used it for 3:43 hurricane but even then that's not needed at all
idk if I ever really used watt final tbh
glad to know tomorrow wasnt just a dream LUL
can't wait to have to set up my n64 on this crt monitor
it looked pretty good when i tried it, just gotta route my cables a bit differently since vga is weird
they should have simply made the n64 480p capable
my headphones will not stay in please hold
also my obs feed got stuck in the top left corner. do you have experience in escaping top left corners?
My fuckin canvas size increased or something since the last time i used this program
I am trying to fix it
let me send you a picture of what i am looking at
I need to get out of the top left corner dude. gdq demands it
no way, that's 1/3 of a second lol
pretty sure all 3 of them hit you in well under a scond
I think ck is lying to you
did you put 3:50 for estimate
hello axl, i have in fact not died
I retired to take care of houseplants and professionally not play paper mario
Every now and then I do ask about you peache114Heart
how the fuck do i use obs
This program has never confused me this much dude
What are the odds the culprit is Windows Update?
knowing windows updates prob like 95%
should i just make the worst video submission gdq has ever seen? I literally do not know how to fix this without manually resizing every single thing on my screen
are you submitting this on ique?
I just don't spend as much time online anymore
its so crazy M4 is back
you're right i forgot how twitch chat works
I can't believe M4 resurrected from the dead
obs, twitch chat, probably the route
The fuck is metal gear peach
I could resize everything else but leave laki bisecting the game feed
I bet someone would find that funny
what the fuck is a hof overlay
I don't even know what my sources mean
Okay I found my eye piercing overlay, it was named 'image'
Yoy of course phanto274Wave phanto274Smile iceblueArrive
I have to re build my scenes and re crop pape
If I had known how much work this was going to be i would've asked to be on the freakin couch
well, i managed to create something that wasn't the absolute worst overlay of all time
probs in the top 5 though
Good meowfternoon, is today a practice day?
in that case good luck on the run(s)!
you're gonna laugh when you see this shit
well its either that or crying
yeah might as well use the group chat since lopez said he might show
You have a copy of the Japanese version of Paper Mario 64?
i have had quite the last 8 hours with dragon quest
my husband lost his memories, and i was a fish
calami29Wigglin calami29Wigglin calami29Wigglin calami29Wigglin I have not made it far enough yet please tell me this game contains wigglers
Do you hate stairs as much as Anakin hates sands?
it was a very alot of information in not alot amount of time
nso is all i have haha
Is the Japanese version of paper Mario 64 harder than the north American version?
shot every time Quizmo doesn't show up :P
Seems like Japan is gearing up for more new support
In Yu-Gi-Oh they confirmed new support incoming for Dark Magician and Sky Strikers
Also main deck Masked HERO cards
So that HERO pile has potentially even more extenders
It's in a Tactical Try pack for the new DM and HERO stuff
And Sky Striker new stuff is in the set after Alliance Insight Duelist Advance
Seems with the GX remaster they're giving out new cards for the GX archetypes
i just wanna be a little shit and active runick fountain but deck is bad now Sadge
Thankfully I don't need to invest into Duelist Advance too hard for the new Sky Striker stuff since they're just one ofs in the deck
Though my ED is getting very tight in Strikers assuming the ratios
I do expect the usual waifu tax for the new Striker cards in Duelist Advance for the TCG
Since they're made of paper wouldn't that just wreck them?
I should eat my korean milk cream donut now
yeah just make sure to put the far right item in the cake
Since donuts are a form of cake
suckered back into the pape 😔
gl and have fun yall despite the pape
me when my standards are high
Fuzzipede is a centipede I think
and the fuzz is his legs
mario wiki says he's based on a caterpillar and we all know how whatever the wiki says is fact.
what is a caterpillar but a fucked up centipede
(also I'm a birb not a bird there IS a difference. And the difference is I'm smelly)
he's made of paper it's very difficult to even stand as paper, nevermind move optimally
Jr Chapter 8 waiting like 👁️ 👄 👁️
Here's the discord. This used to be a big paragraph but it's out of date and I'm too lazy to make a new one.
That's literally my steam bio lmao (minus the here's the discord part obv)
you should always on phase 1 and if you can on phase 2 5 cap
idk if fp let's your power jump twice
Another Phantom stream this is hype
lava is just rock that is on fire, so it is worse
when a mole gives consent you hammer him duh
been here just lurking playing other games haha LuvSign
imagine a speedrun that required an amazy dazey spawn for xp.
gross.  i love the SPM speedrun that has to get ALL of the cards
Who else is in the call?
Oh then I was right it was lopez
“I missed the cloud” reminds me, There’s a famous opera, and at the end our protagonist “flies off on the back of a swan”
So operas will have like a swan boat, that comes onto the stage, singer gets on it, and exits stage left
So Singer is doing his thing singing to audience and the boat appears on stage, and slowly glides behind the singer and it’s supposed to stop behind him. Wait for him to finish singing, let him get on
Swan just keeps going and exits without the singer
Singer finishes, turns around and well no swan
I have to join a research webinar in 30 minutes NotLikeThis
They better not have cams like I’m buzzed and want to get drunk cleaning done KEKW
And loudly proclaims, “Excuse me maestro! Do you know when the next swan is?”
If pape64 does get into a gdq I wanna make a big Raphael plush for the charity
Why is there a dead penguin LMAO
When would gqd announcement be? Just so I know if I have time to make said plush
Ooof that’s not a lot of time to make and finish plush
The one dude looks like the penguin from happy feet
Cheer100 shadow: Pump Shotgun. (silence) shadow: regrets
I have other large plush projects on my plate
That’s not what I heard at first KEKW

mom surprised me with an outing
Woo hoo u rocked that fight!
how am i going to waste my time until it starts
do i have enough time for an existential crisis
does this trick let you gain 200+ aura?
im playing some pso blue burst today but casual bc i only got 3 hours of sleep and had some part time stuff
don't forget  your music is on also idk if important for vod
shoutouts to that Paper Mario ACE TAS that takes over your bizhawk emulator and blue screens your PC
I think random used to always just jump there before hammering for consistency
you skipped 3:46 you're a legend!
my last safe jump was 3:47:01 -> 3:46:16
it was high 3:45 but I got 3 cap huff
it was the metroid high school pb OMEGALUL
probably just star storm sky dive
yesterday was a good fucking day
damn shell shot really does 7 lol
I just watched it back I was already +16 before getting 3 capped
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
I get here and already hear my name lolz
It's the dumb joke I made last time you stood any lolz
I forgot what you said either way...I'm dozing bad
Why is this Saturday so exhausting
@annilyn2 tell me about it. I was cleaning up the yard
Oh hey I got 121 stars on galaxy finally
@angellove94 how bad was the yard?
Why in the world did you make the smoothie if you were gonna have coffee..
still a few dog poop piles and leaves to clean up.
Leftovers are your friend... unless it's leftover poop piles
that’s what I’m about to do lol
lol I have to shower before work.
Make the easiest dinner ever when it comes to pasta
If it's the Alfredo sauce made from scratch...my heart is gonna cry
Could always make the last minute dish if you wanted...
For this very reason. Don't feel like cooking then go for the leftovers
Let's all just have our own times lolz
You look angry playing zelda and happy angry playing paper mario
Okay I need a nap lolz paper mario is too soothing
Gotta put that dumb boot back on
Nice outta prologue hell i see
I need to come back to this game lol
sorry I’m a lil oblivious what’s happening.
I know that chapter 1 grind then something else stupid happens :p
I was so ready to stop my race one time after getting a 3 cap on huff n puff lmao
I’d honestly hate myself to run any game if I get to the point I’m seeing red for 2 hours
I've been awoken by a certain rain drop lolz
Oh damn...but too far in to stop now
Do better mario -.- wasting Phans time
hey phantom. how are the runs man?
youre saving time on best pace
oh I always count the first one from the middle boo LUL
I had no idea those throws were rng
heyhey phantom, best of luck with the runs!
damn thats a big fish lol
I got a minecraft movie ad coming in, I think i should leave
FLINT A STEEL cant hurt me here?
this was THE weirdest sleep I've had
it wasn't bad, but it was on / off
How has the granblue grind been
@Pallos7 they're SUPER KoF-pilled, and it shows
" [BUTTON] ISN'T IN THIS GAME "
Im used to it being in every chat Im in
I think Raven would kill me if I booted up Rising to play Hot Lady Knight instead of XV
I finished making my reg I team that Ive been working on for a good bit, excited to see if its actually good bc I cant do any practice games with it.
Coney has THECACTUS which is all that matters
I don't see GamesBot in chat
Nvm fuck you ohrocks hope your day is going terrible
@ohrocks I was THIS close to doing that outta reflex when Pallos7 said hi to me
one that Ohrocks' is proudly carrying on
I wish worlds had an lcq but Im so excited to go anyway
is the storm hitting your area ?
we might be getting hail in my area
This isn't our weekly Async is it?
You should totally join if not rickyLUL
Ur execution on strats is so quick
@buff00n my area only got grazed by the storm
We have 10-13 submissions every week so it be very cool if you join DinoDance
It's Async so you can play whenever DinoDance
I stepped away to eat a can of tuna
I don't have my glasses on, and my screen's dark
We never do the climb chest
chucky is tired now that he ran across the house once
he does so much to warrant being tired
his mom left him in bed alone this morning and he immediately came to my room
you should do the sliding puzzles
randomize the rupees that spawn from the sliding puzzles
i heard ttyd AP should be releasing this week, then of course DK64 is Wednesday. Also AP update to 0.6.0 tomorrow
yeah, people are pressuring him, Minish Cap is playable but logic isnt done, like why?
You will reset at sword and shield skip
Just remember, as long as you do less glitches than you're previous run, it's valid YEP
That goat was NOT the GOAT
Ok I gotta lurk now. Good luck
doing some stuff, so I'll be in the background
tippiLurk gl on the run or runs
sometimes white people tacos hit ykno
i find the white people taco night song
I hate the name of that
what phantom is saying is waaaaay too true
so w other words: surprise w non- that and make acual tacos KEKW
I need to figure out if biz updating will suffice for retrocheevos
finally continued doing red rescue team and evolutions take a bit and such
like - v2.7 of biz will become softcore only by the end of march 31s aka today KEKW
and transplanting a like 80% + svefile to retroarch for that is like... no wont wok
as for why I got this super old version: rly boils down to "oh yea uhh it works for AP why update"
also... man I wish tinder would work without gps info 😅 but I guess it be what it be
peek dms as for the cackle KEKW
minish cap and crystal exist tippiTap
it could be fun or it could be frustrating. tp rando would be cool or minish cap
that's how it was for me too
a break from pape meant playing MM lol
pape Mario is epic 💯 though
I pretty much took a twitch break and day off and look 👀 what happens phantom everyone legit went on and 9 pbs were made LuL
me too bot 🤖 I hate when raids kill runs and tricks
so what I hear rn: the spagetti factory opened up? tippiGiggle
Glubbers stream last night was unhinged and crazy 🤪
did great 😌 with 4 sub 32s
the fuck is a TP gainer
dont tell me its as stupid as MM gainers
its eexactly as stupid as MM gainers
no I don’t I’ve fallen off ladders before
at least its not the MGS ladder
its coarse and rough and it getes everywhere
I HATE that I can now see the tiling in the graphics here
it's officially window AC unit season where i live
my whole apartmner has AC but my upstairs has poor air flow and so it gets very very hot
this desert 🌵 is better than oot
i sturggle with this so much
whats fast iron boots got to do with it?
you see this new tp ruleset they got going around? i havent tried it yet and it seems awful lmao
yeah i guess they did a new version of it
is it saying no to LJAs?
ive been seeing pigeon and alexander and nozz running them
so its hyper glitchless ruleset then by sound?
its what the weekley races theyre doing instead of blossom
PHANTOMMM sorry me not been around  but me here woo
I got no clue what they allowed / disallowed w TPRando
like - that and WW to me are randos I'd rather not learn glitchless rando rulesets cus BUH
yeah i jsut found the doc, theyre workshopping a drehen 2
WWR lives off of being unhinged everything as it is, and TP like - LJAs are QoL ish
they also really workshopped it alot within the blossom races
i like that wwr just allowed everything tbh
so stuff which if you're really skilled saves time, but is hard to do?
i havent played rando in a long ass time, they introduced smth called hyrule skip and i havent any idea how it works
@Feli_Heli to me its kinda stupid with WWR, but at the same time like - if they like it unhinged so be it
tbh wwr does ban barrier skip at least
drehen also includes pot tho so im not inclined to try it lmao
I just personally would never try and WWRando race w all the glitch stuff being part of "have fun racing" personally is all KEKW
i dont know how to do anything thats on the banned list, but i know some of yall do, the list is insane
@PeachedPocky you on phantoms discord? curious over here
just wanna see / understand what you're talkin about
Any Out of Bounds Any Clips mentioned above Any Iza Item Manipulations Epona Slides (Epona slides out of Goats minigame, before the load, is FINE) Brake Slides & Extended Brake Slides (Doing it while waiting for Zelda to shoot you is FINE) Forest temple skipping boomerang requirement Goron Mines Small Key Skip Climb Actor Dumping Back in Time Big Key Skips Clawshot Actor Displacement Death through Load Zones Wrong warps Freestanding Duping Map Glitch Moon BootsText Displacement
Text Displacement Universal Map Delay Any underwater bombs glitches (air refill, etc..)
what the fuck is an epona slide
i think air refil is also another stupid one to ban
the death through LZ thing I do NOT get
the fuck would that be a banned trick
tp 🧻 rando doesn’t mess around
thats literally JUST smart damage boosting
i aslso think skipping boomerang requirement for forest is silly???
i have clawshot and bomb arrows let me in
no no no I mean Death through Loadzone stuff
thats like - BRUH, that can just happen as it is?
and even if it cant easily happen
like i have no idea how to do either of those things but like
and then a handful of banned clips
the epona / slide related I got no clue on
But these specifics clips are banned Owl Statues Clips Any Forest temple bridge clips Goron Mines Wolf Gate clips Any overworld Gate Clips
neither on the death through loadzone thing
the thing I want enforced more is 5 heart ♥️ damage fool chests
but like - death through loadzone stuff sounds to me like its somewhat easy to learn and eh?
yeah im still just waiting for entrance rando before i throw myself back into it
like - I get by sound that those settings are designed to entice ppl like me who MAYBE know LJAs but thats it
but also i have probably become SO RUSTY i should just try and play tp, learn speedrun or smth
LJAs are SOOO FREE TO LEARN
makes sence why pigeon is always running it
they also have closed map rules too
the more i look at this doc the more upset i get
ill send the link in your discord
now the gate clip shit makes sense
but that also linearizes TP SO FUCKING MUCH
they want boring settings so normies can join
PrideLaugh okay I stop being caps loud now PrideLaugh
in the end they do what they want I rly cant care and such
im never going to try these settings despite what everyone else is doing
but like - it sounds so restrictive ruleset wise on where seeds will end up that it sounds like the seeds will be kinda boring to look at
like they got issac and lunar in on it, so if they try using that for s2 settings i will not be attending lmao
genned on 1.3 I reckon yea?
they have their own dev branch for it
that explains the settings string then
it does require random starting location
Required/Optional Dungeons & Barren Hints are on the website before the seed
thats what theyre doing for random starting locaion, since you cant get ordon hint
what I dont like? the fact they KNOW how the overworld doors break the map
and that they STILL GO WITH IT
idk man, im not gonna try and reason with the french
i wish my quote bot also added dates and what i was playing at the time
"oh we have a random starting locale + button combo to return to spawn easily. it breaks in fyrus' room, DO NOT"
i mean, its still dev builds
some french canadian people made an mm meme category that was really terrible lol, it was just getting all the 3 transformation masks, but it was glitchless and required doing first cycle for some reason
well yeah, but im not a software engineer mr "i used to work for nintendo"
if you go for all transformation masks
COUNT GIANTS AND FD AND CALL IT HUNDO
well luckily it was only deku, goron and zora lol
also speaking of custom coding the thing im probably most interested in is your ad timer, because i just had the ads manager popped out and capture that window lmao
@Feli_Heli yea uhhh my argument is Giants and FD are transformation masks
which like - THEY DO THE ANIMATION AND ALL
oh dont wate your effort, i know exactly 0 things about coding, they tried to teach me in college and it didnt work out great
Zant Phase 5 only, only required Sword 3 (sword 4 to get to zant but the boss himself need only 3)
LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER WHY YOU DO DIS
is this in prep to boss shuffle which isnt in this?!
they are working on boss entrance shuffle
okay so it is boss shuffle prep then
> open arbiters grounds > cannot enter boss room from the mirror
@PeachedPocky I saw that and was like "brooo" but it makes sense with boss shuffle in mind
but also like - why does this of all things rly matter (also PoT related): Less Key palace Only 5 small keys (7 before)
and the keys they skip are the first doors east and west wing
>Open palace >You can warp at Mirror's Chamber >You still need to find the access to gerudo desert (Auru’s memo)
like - I get why they skip those, but like - just make PoT keysy
its SUCH a stupid dungeon for a rando experience
@PeachedPocky the point is that you can include PoT earlier logically I reckon
so as to NOT require AG before
and using aurus memo to set the "can warp there" flag
i think its still funny tho
but then like - just code a barricade to the backside of AG and done
you can have the portal to go to mirror, BUT yopu still gotta get memo and go to the desert bcuz closed map, but ALSO dont go into the boss room once you get there!
okay then I get why they specify to not use the backdoor
Done with my errands and in time for my fave fight
what do you think this is?
like... to those general seed settings things, I dont mind most of that
but the restricted overworld bit sounds SUPER dumb
just let the devs cook longer then for the settings to make sense to a player joining for the first time
only in battle network you go fast by rubbing your face against the wall
@Axl_SR i am not a smart man
actually surprised that title went through btw
i was absolutleyt expecting to be told no to cockblock
@PeachedPocky I had it block that to me once so I went Kok instead KEKW
I am, SUPER fiending for a burger rn and I have no idea why
i remember watching you take over for someone at an event to do that trick lmao
named it "YOU SHALL NOT PASS"
that arealfos really was like "i've had enough of your shit, actually"
" Bro, bro. You're kinda in the way of me doing the exploit. Ya mind? '
" Can't be doing that, man. "
ive never done this lja that way, but im also old man yells at cloud
i hate this room, so, so much
also with all these changes theyre making, where is my poe skip for arbiters grounds
Phantom, imagine if that happened when Spike handed you the controller LUL
@Axl_SR that would have been a GQD rollercoaster KEKW
Omfg that split art is so cute I am always in envy of artists who are so good like that
sec wrong thing in the copy paste KEKW
Phantom fails it, hands back to spike, "youre on your own now" KEKW
That's a good style it's got all the right spice
aw cmon... its not showing the clips on your channel PoroSad
not just for the titles KEKW
cus FUCK KNOWS HOW THOSE WENT THROUGH
Damn rip to a real one (The enemy)
im, just glad i got away with cockblocked
your clip is also more focused then mine is @PeachedPocky tippiTap
I didnt adjust the start of it at all, just said "yea lets go w that" lazy mode
@Jonxhas i am a clip making connoisseur
@Jonxhas the start was defualt, i just clipped out the end, but i always make the ajustment for mobile users bcuz like, its good to have
i hate the one, forgewt wher (i dont fight them often) where the fuckin guy is hiding behind a wall in a whole ass other section
what i hate most is the statue puzzle, because i dont run it often enough to know how to do it
only thing i saw about tot was sword requirement
it was a run for sure
who may or may not still be here
i barely recognize tp music anymore lmao im so used to any of them being in the background
my cat is mad at me rn so shes not speaking to me
had a dream about my old cat today
because the amazon deliveyr guy with her food was delayed
so she had to go a whole extra HOUR without her food bowl being filled to thebrim (it was still half full)
shes also mad at my mom, because she was folding laundry on the couch and she could not take up the whole half of the couch
i sent a picture of my spoiled princess in your discord
she also likes to bother me at 5:30 when im getting ready for work and will scream at me if i do not give her a hug, which is what i say to her when i pick her up like baby
I have a calico who’s insecure like that
chaos likes to walk towards my room, and i never keep my door fully closed so she can get in, but she will aproach the door, and get on her back legs and slam open the door like the fucking koolaid man
like she wonty just, nudge the door open with her face or anything like a cat would, no, she HAS to slam it open
my siamese knew how to open door knobs
i dont understand how map glitch works tbh
and what does map glitch do for you?
darn, I missed the clip watch
OH IT PREVENTS LOADING ZONES i understand now
sorry, xy, dpad right, z and start?
well that seems alot easier to do on the xbox controller i use since i dont use a gc controller lmao
its still a clawgrip and a half
shoutouts to the shittiest DPad of them all
Gc dpads are so ass this is why pokemon runners dual wield
does this game read from p2 at all
IT'S TRUE, WE USE A GBA SP AND GC CONTROLLER
@Swiftalu roxas KH2 moment except the keyblades are the GC and GBA SP KEKW
you could always swap your controller for a ddr pad really fast and stomp your foot
now I wanna see the roxas axel intro cutscene to the fight but with the GC and the GBA SP over oathkeeper and oblivion KEKW
@PeachedPocky Gamecube dpad SUCKS and gba sp buttons are tiny and far/awk to kinda use for a long period of time
"were having fun" he said, completely deadpan
@Swiftalu just use a different controller entirely??? or does it have to be origional hardware
@PeachedPocky both plugged in at once I imagine
@PeachedPocky Can be any hardware but why do that when I have the 2 controllers right here
put a rock on ddr pad right
Is that a wii pro controller???
that looks like a wiiu pro controller
Wii u pro controller is way better than that
i have a switch pro controller finally, and ive been using it fo play my games on switch, the killer being when i emulate tp i still use my xbox controller, and the buttons are swapped because i was an idiot when i started
@PeachedPocky hear me out: are the sticks full 360 degrees or no
I do have to say the Xbox controller has a really amazing stick for what it is
cus my parents got 2 OG Switch Pro controllers and one of them has a 4direction stick
it knows flat 90 degree angles and then goes 45 degree diagonal on dual input only
it does NOT know proper stick ranges
like - with your xbox controller
odd? but anyways, its an 8bitdo switch pro controller so
go to this, with your xbox controller plugged in
theyre pretty much exactly the same except the face buttons are swapped
if you see it properly updating, then ggs
maybe it’s an input mode thing?
one of the controllers they got was ONLY giving flat 90 degree angles and added up the diagonals like how a fighter stick would
that just sounded like it was broken???
and my parents refused to RMA it
cus "oh no we dont feel that difference wdym 1st worlr problem"
I literally showed them how bad it was and they refused to understand
you don’t need sword pull only yeto. look into eyes of yeto
or is this a "oh no you're on firefox" issue again
this is looking like a toma run if it can happen it does
did I tell u about the time I tried to climb goron mountain
ok brb I have a clip u will laugh
ill be back in abit need to investigate food
Midna can you distract the ice guy just fly up there
I thought I jumped no it was a bullshit offscreen meteor
how the fuck did those even happen up there
I NEVER saw the eruptions still actively happen up there
yeah no one knew what I was talking about when I said I hated the meteors
well yea cus thats super stupid to happen
also like... the fact they came down TWICE
like - that was some looney toons type shit
i have returned with peperettes and cheese
like a slim jim but like, its good and a bit bigger
I cant wait for in like 2 weeks - they got oven cheese listed as "will be on discount" and I know its the good kind
i loved beef jerky but I think most of them add celery and soy
thinkin of gettin myself like 4 or 5 of those paired with decent bread, then doin a couple cheesy days w that
I know mozza the cheeses except that one
yeah i know camemvert, you mean like just soft cheese? like brie?
unrelated i9 can and will eat a while wheel of brie to myself
we got those round here in wooden like - bowls? basically prepared so you could just chuck it in the oven
is it warmed or melted. is it like a melted cheese pot or just mushy cheese
entire idea goes around having it warmed to slightly melted
like do you dip the stick on it
yea and they got he good brands where you know the cheese is good
i like my brie deep friend, cover it in good breading, then put some roasted tomatoes ontop or other such things, and just eat that
i havent had that in a LONG TIME
easy to do rly - just get the cheese you like, put it in a heat resistant bowl and then either microwave or oven til slightly melted
and then take it to a bread of your choosing, if you feel real spicy, take some marmelade to it
yeah but i dont care for mozzerella much anymore on its own
ive very much grown into my old chedder taste buds
mozarella I wouldnt rly recommend for this idea personally, not enough taste to it tippiTap
man i really want some brie now
I like skim milk mozzarella with vinegar
like my favourite is just marble cheese, hands down, goes with everything
I dont know what marble cheese is p4ntzThink
idk what it exactly is, but its the orange and white cheese together
but for the "heated cheese w bread" idea: I would personally recommend a midly spicy one, though obv. personal preference as to which you choose
idk man we just call it marble cheese up here
then heat it up til slight melty, bread and marmelade / jelly
I see why its called marble cheese
i think a good baguette toasted with some oil and herbs on it would go great with melty cheese, but now im just thinking fondue
@PeachedPocky nah you're on the dot with that KEKW
like - fondue thoughts 1 to 1 are transferable to the "oven cheese" idea PrideLaugh
im not a big spice fan unfortunatley
like - cheese goes with SO many things
but my mom makes this EXCELLENT jalapeno jelly, that you but on creamcheese or brie and a cracker, to DIE for
like - I WISH I could go for somethin fancy like that
but the discount I am lookin at is still a couple days in the future
will show what I am talkin about then ofc PrideFlower
also gotta hope that the airfrier will handle it fine KEKW and gotta get myself a bowl cus as much as I should trust the airfrier
my brain's like "yea no metal in this thing" like with a microwave
and before I end up being right on my "fear" there, I'd rather just know it cant be a problem and such
i wouldnt put metal in a air fryer only because like, i dont want it flying around
nvm found a picture of a recipe
cus its not actual food, its in general instead
Poor Limk, all those bonks on the head made him forget the inputs
@PeachedPocky check phantoms discord for what I was talkin about PrideFlower
oh no she’s dead what will we tell yeto —first time players
I legit thought it would make me fight yeto after this
as much as its for some reason not workin for me
so i decieded due to this convo i wanted cheese crackers and jelly, but we are out of breton crackers so i got saltines
I used to live off of saltines
its not no but my mom has my car and im impatient
@PeachedPocky did you see the recipe I posted on phantoms discord?
or food idea rather cus heated cheese is SUCH an ez baseline for SO many options in food
piiiiissed.. why are hoppip skiploom and jumpluff all 3 so SQUISHY on pmd... papeHands
I like PMD but I never complete mystery dungeon games when they’re too deep
I did play through PMD red rescue team and explorers (darkness and sky) through to finish once minimum on each of them
like usually there’s some amount of weapon grinding involved
but never did a recruit'em all
now I chose to do recruit them all cus retrocheevos
and red/blue rescue team are MEAN on that
yea I only did red rescue team and sorta on / off w it
cus I knew it would become painful if I did
but 1) you cant recruit the last step of an evo line in red/blue rescue team, GOTTA EVOLVE
and 2) I chose not to wish cave for mons
also 3) I didnt go and do manips for mons so far, with 377/386 total recruited mons, like 50 evos to do on that "got" list still
I played monster girls and the mysterious adventure 2 and it feels very PMD to me
it’s like an indie game by a Japanese developer
my mom got me a pretty sick wolf t shirt and I didn’t ask but it’s very twilight princess coded
it’s like full shirt print black and white
I have a gamecube controller that has correct bottom notches but bad top notches
yeah, like you can learn a controller but then it sucks if you use someone else’s controller
yeah you need spin for skull dragon guy
I was using an input remapper for notch correction in SM64 but it made it harder to pull off tiny movements
I don’t like how the GC controller doesn’t pull uniformly
it’s like very vertical and horizontal biased
quick spins cannot be preformed by a human
IF the quickspin is detected the same as it is in SMS
its checking each 90 degree angle within x amount of time starting either clock or counter-clockwise
and you gotta hit all 4 to get your "360 degree recog"
that being said? I am hinging on SMS info which they finnagled around figuring out
wait are you saying I’d be goated at quic spins because of sunshine
in sunshine its literally that stupid
You can't do map glitch in glitchless...
in sunshine its x amount of frames between each or something, I'd have to dig up the video again
but its SUPER stupid simple like
and I would want to actually bet something if I had something to bet with
definitely ask cus I dont know how TP does it
my feel from having played sunshine is that its the same input detection
aka "within x frames of each other, hit the 4 cardinals, then B input"
I know in sunshine you basically spin and then slam a direction for the air movement
for sunshine you get a pretty significant buffer yea
like - 5 to 8 frames or whatever it was post spinput to input?
could be thinkin its too free
but its definitely simple to do
I know TP is stuuuupid long input buffer KEKW
yea I got no clue on how indetail Tp does it
obviously you cant find good info on that
cus its swamped by rando and shorts on youtube >.>
but like - by feel from the retrocheevo set? its not that far different from spinputs in SMS
just with the additional buffer you get which Gamecube / Wii Zeldas had on their input detection
cus what works in windwaker also works in TP for quick spins
I would personally write it up to "yea the one controller where you cant hit it has a bad stick"
but without the behind the scenes info you cant test hardware against software
you get what I mean though
I know what ESS is yea
hell - you should only ever need a 50% range input in any direction IMO to get the circle motion detected
cus MM doesnt allow ESS adapters for SOME UNGODLY REASON
i mean you can use an ess adapter, just not for ess
i use mine for notch correction
I just heard "yea ESS adapters are banned" and then brain went "buh"
cus I renembered the whole "oh yea you cant use these for runs" while OoTs side did allow it and sideline me just doesnt understand why for 2 games on the same console to have a difference there of all things
idk ess in oot is already easy
the ess range is actually like twice the size as it is in mm
OoT ESS is WAY more free then MMs
which cus it was that free afaik they just allowed them and said "fuck it" or whatever - going off of hearsay there, so big piles of salt please
versus in MM you dont have those software side deadzones making it harder
as in "game input detection" for what I mean w software
i wish i knew why they messed up the analog stick so much in mm
@Feli_Heli I wanna know why they fucked up the camera that bad in MM moreso KEKW
cant even walk straight on n64 because theres no deadzone
like - as much as I like MM SO much more then OoT
OoTs camera, while jank, is not as jank as MMs is
we dont have to talk about mm camera
the input detection I feel like is a byproduct of them removing the software side deadzones
and relying entirely on the sticks themself
but you never have the perfect stick in 100% of game scenarios
the raphnet adapters let you add a deadzone on n64 and its nice for mm
like - I personally would prefer a world where you dont HAVE to account for bad sticks
but like... because it doesnt exist, you gotta do them softwre side *sighs*
does TP Practice rom have input reading?
ag angles are whatever they feel like it
interesting how it only senses up to 72 on that input display for the sticks
rather then showing 100 for full input
what is what on the x360 controller?
oh yea I know that the x360 and xbOne controllers dont have a proper neutral
which in turn forces assumed deadzone coding YEP
now - proper stick drift past that neutral nonsense you're talking is imo WAY worse
but like - thats still pretty stupid of a thing they decided to do
which afaik sony just jumped onto the same bandwagon
No, like I don't know how
Like, you know, right, but I don't
there is a nonzero chance of 0.6.1 dropping tomorrow as well due to a discovered vulnerability in the FFMQ apworld. Not a likely danger to anyone at the moment, but worth a fast turnaround to patch out the vulnerability before any kind of exploit becomes a threat.
btw wind waker is now supported
Never heard of Sleeping Princess or Faxanadu lmao
yo gl on the run today Phantom!
the major thing for pokemon emerald is New option free_fly_blacklist
Or Saving Princess I mean lmao
so you can blacklist little root free fly
"Note: there's a potential remote code execution exploit in the Final Fantasy Mystic Quest implementation, that can be triggered during generation with that game. If you want to ensure you're safe, you can go to your AP install directory, then lib, then worlds and then delete ffmq.apworld."
just area lock him its free
never played BN so I have no clue what any of that means but it sounds fantastic lmao.
darkness, its super laterr post game in vanilla and is a difficult fight
I do some pril fooling with rng curse
I think serenade is harder than BassGS
yeah, serenade isnt as easy as "remove an aura"
are you still interested in doing APs?
ive moved away from asyncs, now I run syncs every thursday and saturday
I'd be down to join a sync I haven't done a sync in months lol
ive gotten a 25 sec goats in rando
I remember it taking me like 10 tries to do that casually cause I kept aiming him directly at the monkey lmao.
ttyd dev said first release is this month so now everyone shut up about being impatient
I also remember being very confused by the fishing casually cause the cat just wouldn't take the first fish I caught LUL
yeah, just look at how bn3 turned out
now I'm curious does anything happen if you shoot them? LUL
If you got the choice to shoot them all, what order would you do it in?
If I come back during my lunch break and you are doing ams I will report you for fraud.
technically Phantom's already a fraud cause he reset on goats 1
I really like all the progress banjo made, we even got a new update last night. Favorite feature is playing it on hardware. In a sync I run 6 boss win con and that only takes about 3 hours.
So with Dk64 being a similiar game im excited to try it this week
I think you meant to say goat shit
Does that mean you've figured out why your other controller seemed to be better at it?
Wait, so they want you to overspin the stick?
Now I wonder ho jank it is on wii
Time to build a split gamecube controller using a nunchuk to make your spins easier Kappa
in all seriousness will u react to the direct tomorrow!?!
i find it so fun honestly
Yeah I hate that room like wtf
I think that one has interesting movement
I thought ook would be defined as a mini boss
tileworm bridge room feels good to do fast
honestly the worst room is the big baba room it's boring
other than the outside rooms where you run straight
the 6th monkey room is sick imo
the one with deku like skip
If I can skip the spiders sure
But man the vines...analog glitches stuck
the 7th monkey room with the underground monkey is jank af if you go for the fast strat but stilll kinda fun imo
The only thing that turns me off from glitchless from watching it is just the stuff that isnt dungeons or twilights
Are you gonna have your current pic there a sticker?
yea like rolling through hyrule field
I'd say the twilights are annoying tbh
I disagree, ive always been a twilight enjoyer
I'm supposed to be doing clothes
twilight blitz sounds great to me the only thing i dont like is running 3 minutes in lanayru
although in any%, the chill 3 minutes is nice for me to mentally prepare for elh
i dont like routes with super late Bo
hundo too yea although i love hundo soidk what im talking about
Hey ad... come at me bro. Let's tussle
hundo just has a flow to it that i really like
and having hiddenn skills and items allows you to remove some of the annoying/boring stuff
That's it I'm buying a buttplug
You know... it's not false so..
I have returned from ad city
wow... who are you and what did you do with DF
Something got me thinking, and I don't think moon boots is technically a glitch, but I see why it's banned regardless
@SwiftPichu_ why do you think it's not a glitch?
@bdamja a well timed damage boost, at least that's how it started
Bro lost to the goron lol
Anni get up and do clothes omfg you've played this game hundreds of times
@SwiftPichu_ I mean moonboots is different than damage boosts
I saw it but it was too fast to decipher lolz
I'd say ordon is perfect time
It was just out of shot lolz
Gotta stretch the fingers before mashing
Okay I'll fold them after bulblin
TP soundtrack might be my fav zelda ost
Damn that was a hard left
Okay I'm getting up...gonna lurk phanto274Smile
just got hit with the most epic april fools prank
In found out I have hair lice
Why was it so foggy btw?
I can never get that right and now I know why
After getting hit I gotta go around a bit... cool ad city
It's like a dog trying to go through their puppy door
I can see it too... it's frustrating man
ive heard this is a problem that can happen
would it be worth to switch controllers mid cutscenes
why not just use this controller with notch correction
to do quick spins on him
what does buffering map glitch do exactly
I mean 2 bomb arrows isn't much slower than quick spins no?
Alright I'm insanely sleepy rn and idk why so imma nap
If you're not doing bomb jump then there's no extra equip
If you try again... phanto274GL if you try again
i mean its not hard though
cuz you use bomb arrows in chapel anyway
how do you buffer map glitch
it makes them all happen frame perfectly
i just learned that you can do that lol
what do you mean its not getting reset
can you still do inputs while holding it
time to buy another controller Kappa
well for map glitch you can hit the dig button at the same time
and that lets you figure out if you got the right frame
except the stick is completely fricked
I have a generation 1 black gc controller I play tp with
i just assumed based off input display lol
ok so surely you'll race me in ams now right Kappa
Mr Phantom, why hasn't Amazon shipped my order yet?
I do love me some glitchless
dang that input display is the same price as an elctromodder lol
wait the electromodder is only $50
can you just stay in here foreever
mm runners will do anything to avoid using an adapter
yeah but he doesnt use it
a lot of mm runners say that input displays mess up their ess
i think its just placebo though lmfao
did you name your splits "Enter Snowpeak" as a jab at MM runners using "Enter Snowhead" LUL
3 spins is just that easy
All moldorms are rude asses if you ask me
Have yet to see a moldorm that I'm happy to see
The only game where it's not annoying is echoes- you know the one where it can be on your side for once
It's the mini moldorm design from alttp there, they really don't do much, just move around and die
The speedrun just binds 1 moldorm, then throws it off the cliff
Aah, have yet to learn that part
Learning the run 1 dungeon at a time, so the knowledge doesn't escape my mind
I completely lost interest in the run when I found out physical 1.0.0 is faster than digital 1.0.1 for All Dungeon
and Digital 1.0.2 is faster for glitchless, but patches the wrong warp
Like, I'm not buying a fuckin cart to keep up with competitive times
And I'm not upgrading my game so I can exclusively run glitchless
I am stuck on 1.0.2, cause I forgot to disable auto update
The switch really is the worst when it comes to game versions
I need to make a clip to get the golden banana lol
Modern ones maybe, I've always been nintendo only, so I wouldn't know about the other consoles
I know the 3ds just let you uninstall updates in settings
imagine not keeping your switch in airplane mode
even on 3ds and wii u it happened, just less often
I just turn off auto updates
I'll tell my shit when I want it to update
my switch is homebrewed so the homebrewed part is just always in airplane mode
thats super rare btw as a whole
another decent example is team cherry for hollow knight explicitly allowing you to load specific versions on steam (console is less open there cus console)
so you could still do all the rando or speedrun shenaniganry you wanted
ok am out of adge now
is twitch in comic sans as their april fools prank
ACTION waddles in to see everything in comic sans
its a 7tv thing for SURE
cus I heard someone else say they had it going
yeah i don't see anything in comic sans
I got FFZ as the only addon for enabling all those emotes
and didnt get hit by it, was somewhat confed
cursed ass stallord is the worst
its why i hated getting ag in rando races lmao
step i dont use the music cues,  i just kinda learnd issacs way of x many steps then a roll thhen spinner
ah yeah i learned it was like 4 steps two rolls and then spinner, smth like that, its been a while
im mediocre at it, so i wasnt consisant, and its also been so goddamn long
i just rewatched issacs thing, it was 2 steps 4 rolls
like, two full steps, like left right, left right,
i used that and then in tune w the music helped
you keep saying that and im unsure what you mean by chained rolls
officially gonna be doing MM on hotfix next friday and then i'll be on TP weedMario
yo morp gg on getting in
i gotta actually do tp stuff at some point lol
theres too many things to do in mm
just gonna postpone doing all masks for rn and play this
i want to do tp 100% ILs
wtf run are you doiing rn ?
you start from snow peak ???
i discover a new speedrun on tp
isnt that in all dungeons too
i wanna learn the fused shadows run i think id have an easier time with that
maybe i should learn ams instead :')
back in time sounds so frusterating lmao
*cuts to video of phantom screaming at hugo* uh huh
i figured theyre all part of the same group of shit needed for ems and back in time, not gonna do one without the others
so does ams start with like, a universally used save file or smth
ive never seen that happen yet lmao i must always been looking away
getting fucked over by a nickel;
yeah it seems like a good one to do, and also it will help me get through the two dungeons i hate
sounds also just like a good run to learn alot of shit idk how to do
or how to use splits in livesplit
what do you put in your chili?
not a bean believer i see
ag coming for ya today damn
kidney beans in chili are sooo good though tippiTap
like - if you dont like'em sure tippiGiggle I dont mind them, looove them in spicy food
you'd hate one of my favourite dishes then
its literally "just" mashed potatos with green beans cut down to smaller pieces
bit of milk to make it more floofy, done
Why are they called green beans anyways, if only half of the name is true?
i like kidney beans in chili
but thats just bcuz i like the texture
so what is it about them that you dont like if I may ask? texture, taste, mix of the two?
but i also use like, celery
imo celery is so hard to integrate into dishes
i put it in alot of things
ok - then MAYBE a guess as to what you could try, though obviously ends up being your decision PrideFlower
cus I as an example HATE the texture of overcooked pumpkin
the bland taste? fine no problem
yall telling me celery has a taste???
uhhh i'm sure i've had it once
but them being mushy? I HATE that
i made an omelette with diced celery once but it's just too crunchy and ruins the texture
so maybe if its more about the texture, try adding them in later or earlier depending to try out if that changes something tippiShrug
i put celery in soups, stews, spaghetty saice, chili
cus like - a LOT w pumpkin for me boiled down to it being overcooked and losing its taste
whereas when I was allowed to care about a veggie soup w pumpkin in it, I was more then okay eating the pumpkin bits in there
hmmm maybe a chicken soup with celery would be fine
cus they still had some bite and tasted "not shit"
celery goes SUPER well with chicken soup
@graample chicken soup or al;phabet vegtable soup
its just an extra veggie i can throw in
just gotta make sure that for personal preference, you're not throwing in too much given that celery can be overwhelming
yeah celery taste is rly strongkgk
it could also be a regional difference thing
oh in t he same way that cilantro tastes like soap to me yeah
cus when I think of celery, it does have a distinct flavor to it
and you can very much overdo it
i fuckin love celery, put peanut butter or cheese whiz on it
its what my mom fed us alot bcuz it was low cal, and ya know, early 00's diet fads and what not we had to count the 7year olds calories
that I wholeheartedly disagree with based on memory alone tippiGiggle
yeah the stringy celery would be the only difference
what if you dip the celery in ranch
celery is literally just rhubarb with no taste
oh i should mention i don't have an oven. so shepherd's pie is out of the question
why do they give you celery with hot wings
yo celery and hot wings is a GREAT idea
bcuz crunky and good in blue cheese
cheaty cheato roundabout way to maybe get sheperds pie to work: try makin it in a pot
@graample no excuse, my friend had to cook her thanksgiving meal with her bbq after her oven died
dunno if that will work out fine
then shove it in the airfrier
that thing's literally a small oven KEKW
just yk - smaller portions at a time
but what you could then also do if the airfrier idea is a food for thought type of thing
someday i'll invest in a countertop toaster oven. or... move
is prep yourself lots of it, freeze what you dont need
and then do it in small portions based on how much ya want tippiTap
cus I mean - a small bowl WILL fit in an airfrier, I am near 100% certain of it
Is a skeleton even capable of sucking a dick? Like I don't know much bout that, but isn't a tounge necessary for it?
another way if you wanna brown the potatoes,
ag is just out for blood today with ya
its so quick to get through
the reason is, you did it for fu.... damnit
You did it, because it's boring? Weird reason
Wait, now I can't unhear it
thats all im gonan think about now
Does that mean you get 1million every time you kill a boss? IS THAT WHY STALLORD IS SUCH A BITCH?
Haven't seen any ww runs yet
Yo hope you been doing good
lmao showing off the new mug?
io know youve been gone a while, but did you see what Nozzly has been up to in the TPR discord?
they made a dedicated TP bingo game mode on their website
ive been playing it alot the last few days its been a blast
Okay, so this is a seed someone else played and they complained about it. I did not see anything so lets make Phantom play it LUL
but yeah the bingo mode we've been playing involves using a vanilla rando seed they made, so all major items/keys/poes/bugs/shop items/etc are all vanilla, so its been using alot less rando strats and more actual speedrun stats
so ive been trying my best to learn those. I clipped into lakebed bossroom yesterday felt very nice
speaking of pape i npc push to clip pass the warehouse key that was ass
wrestle  that naked old man!! phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
then 5 mins later someone sent me the key KEKW
oh geez, that was rough LMAO
this goat is on the scenic route
at least it was worth it yikes HAHAH
didya see the TTYD rando alpha mention?
even if it is through AP primarily
yea I know that PrideLaugh still curious myself
will keep ya posted - imo it mostly depends on QoL related
so like - i chapter warps, homeward shroom of some kind
so you dont have to corridor all of them
gonna be nice for ch 4
^ ch4 and 7 come to mind
cus of story prog depending on how roughy that is set to be initially
early bow and claw is nice
with the whole "vanilla might lock you in sota"
okay so coral earing is locked behind fishing rod, good to know
didnt want the other purple rupee?
guess we'll see what ends up being the case w the rando though cus I mean - input bugtesting and such
but yeah next glitch i wanna learn for tp is map glitch and bit/bite
imo it should be a skippable thing, if they rly wanna have it be there
decent rando being the big bit there yea
place goombella in rougeport for the goombella check
bottle is a bottle i guess lamo]
I would then be similarily biased on how MMRando works
with respecting cycle behavior (now you can turn all of that cycle behavior thought stuff off ofc)
then not literally shuffling every single interactable, rather going for statics only primarily
I was distracted a wee bit
first is 500, then 200 for malo mart
wish you grabbed that purple rupee in faron field now huh LMAO
or the AP version person allows for exporting that whole thing...
is it the paper mario issue?
@Axl_SR I brought up TTYD trollinGiggle
you need to log in for starting boots and hammer
i cant say, it would spoil too much
Yeah springwater is listed as an in logic way to get to castle town and lanayru province, its easily forgettable tho
ah okay then yeah springwater and the chest are the only eldin field checks, as the statue isnt in eldin field region
is this the seed you told me bits about axl?
yeah the chest is eldin dield, but the sky character itself isnt an eldin field check, its north eldin region
weird toadpoli is junked, as its *techincally* not a sphere 0 grotto, but you can get it woth just sword/shadow crystal
logically, toadpoli is locked behind bow
which shields you can buy in hyrule
true, but you can do it with just wolf and a sword
oh did they move that shield about?
I dont know know whats so bad about just doing toadpoli grotto
you can guy wooden shield from goron hot spring, that isnt shuffled
@PeachedPocky I just dont know if all of the options you're mentioning are also logical or not
@Jonxhas they are not, but it can be done
well, wooden shield from goron hot spring shop might be, i have no idea
whats with the slide when youire clawshotting things? are you doing that intentionally?
Hmm good to note i suppose
they really said fuck all grottos huh
yeah i got a bunch of new tech to learn that isnt rando specific
at least you got your money back?
starting with all ft, city, POT, and TOT keys is very specific
as thats none of your required dungeons
you got shield bas you can go into mines
why is THAT tied to shadow crystal
wait really? i thought you could change time without it
should be that and info only?
cant access the chest without boots so yeah
i see why this seed sucked now lmao?
at least you have another shot at that faron field rupee for money now lmao
can map glitch for mist checks i guess? out of logic
ah right i thought you said yo had gate keys, but thats kak gate not faron  gate
cant get to snowpeak without crystal either i imagine
literally what im doing rn yeahg
he did give faron woods gate key????
he gave that and a purple rupee
sent it in your discord, he did give faron woods key
small key - gate to faron woods
only helpful if you have shadow crystal
i didnt realize those keys were sepperated
but they in terms of ingame text afaik are named the same
anything else to do at daytime?
also goron shops in castle town
would be hilarious if it turns night right when you warp back trollinGiggle
Why is link dressed like an eggplant?
also its an upside down eggplant
oh you want agatha first right
also yeah when you get the faron woods key the door opens automatically you dont need to actually open the gate
that opens up some stuff thankfuly
kak gorge lantern cave, upper zoras river, aetc
we know iza 1 is nothing, but iza 2 and fishing hole
not that you have fishing rod, but fishing hole heart piece
I hate TP rando solely cuz these tunic colors
you can change the colors lmao
your point is as dumb as these tunic colors
well, if you can get boots you cvan do mines, maybe the other gate key is in there
fair enough have a nice day
i see why this seed was not liked lmao
oh the alcove chest? did yo do watch tower chest? i mightve been looking away
a sword, kinmdve? are you referring to fountain chest?
I mean this rly just sounds so far like the "no shadow crystal start" of TPRando
yes, I fucked up the sentence gloriously - ya get what I mean though
like - I renember when I first rolled myself a seed and specifically said "i wanna have a nothing start"
hey did the lock fall off when you got the faron woods key
it ended up being 4 hours of running around in search for the thing trollinGiggle
that means you got North faron woods key
you can maybe get fountain chest in sct with back slice, but thats out of the way
can ball and chain destroy the spire rock?
cuz wolf can just skip the first key
bcuz you can get spire heart piece with claw
but you cant get around the 2nd if you dont have the portal
you dont need epona eob to get the piece once the rock is gone
ah i c, i just didnt know if it would reach
prolly bcuz you just got ball and chain?
what if I sent you a plando submission and it was just vanilla
its what we've been using for bingo lmao
im gonna remove all the quality of lifes, im gonna leave the twilights on, the cutscenes on, tutorial on
and make all junk checks traps
and then i'll turn on 1 hit ko
and bonks do damage, just to be silly
fuck up ems once and die
I mean - ofc this seed would do that
well, eldin field is apth to blizetta...
got both dom rods here LMAO
inb4 this is a swordless seed KappaPride
cant be, citry requires ordon or greater
but you could prolong swords got til then if this is a plando
hide the swords just barely before you need them or some such
both dom rods were in eldin, springwater and the cliff heart piece
tbh if it was me plandoing
Id put a sword on morpheel, and a sword on argorok
to have the 3rd be in the treasury of HC PrideLaugh
and then make you do argorok with ordon sword
@Jonxhas need ms to beat ganon
cuz thats the funniest way to piss phantom off
I agree, stopping at upper along the way
@PeachedPocky read what I put as the 2nd trollinGiggle
you could absolutely enter HC without MS
I have seen shitty plando KEKW
how do you do morpheel without swird
you could absolutely create nonsense scenarios in this
water bomb one shots phase 1
and then you can just punch him in the eye for phase 2
i knew phase 1 water bombs but didnt know you didnt need a sword for phase 2
@PeachedPocky another STUPIDLY mean thing to do would be to include all poes no junked and have a sword on the last of the 3 poes of cave of ordeals
cus I am pretty sure given you then would HAVE to have access to wolf, it would be doable down to there
@Jonxhas youd have to have a bunch of other items to get that far tho lmao
I dont actually think that works
you'd need to give them atleast 2 swords
and with 2 swords they can just go find the other one
you'd need the other 2 swords in cave of ordeals
@PeachedPocky yea and? nothing holds you off from forcing swordless Ball&chain / wolf only combat trollinGiggle and REALLY all you need to get that far down last I recall is Ball&chain, spinner, wolf and aurus memo
or is the last poe behind domrod2 door?
in which case - 2 domrods, done
you need dominion rod 2 for cave
hey is cave of ordeals junked LMAO
I just scared the living SHIT out of you there didnt I @PeachedPocky KEKW
or need dominion rod 2, double claw shot, ball and chain, atleast 1 sword, wolf form for ghost rats, and memo to get there
I dont know jack about this seed
you dont need a bomb bag to do it
was she outside? i didnt see
if shes inside its already open
ah ok i just didnt see her
yeah its just if the portal is already unlocked
inside is when the portal is jsut unlocked
cant kill shadow beats with balla nd chain?
might need them tighter to each other
asking cause its not marked on the tracker
since you have back slice, could you not get fountain chest, get magic armor, use it as boots?
ive not seen it done without a sword, but ive also only seen it done once
ah well, i thought it wouldve been a cracked idea if that worked LMAO
also yes, axls right you didnt mark bow on tracker
woo the best cave in the game madcap4Bongo
was like the second thing you got lol
ive done this cave countless times, i still get stuck on the middle puzzle
push middle one next to that box
its hard for me to convey the solution you had available
afaik this one just goes "far from the bit of corner first then the other one" ?
cus you can always get to the one in the bit of corner given the 1 block is missing
but the other side you gotta create that shape first
I dont recall what the move count I end up with is for these 3 😅
this one is so much easier
I just enjoy these types of puzzles too much
i cant wait for this to be a junk check
what is even open to you right now
double dom rod checks idk what else tho since I missed most of it.
well theres two checks ehre at least
does double claw shot open anything in cits?
are there any double clawshot checks?
oh yeah there is the double claw in kak gorge and sct, but yeah way out of the way
then kak gorge you got the owl statue there and the dcs check
was this plando or just specific settings someone requested?
How goes it? Sorry I haven't been here for a while
axl sent in this seed because he saw someone else suffer with it
oh you can land on the spikes, neat
should also open south castle town while youre at it
since you have a bottle and did springwater rush
Bring him spring water witha  bottle
you did psringwater rush soi the guy inside sells spring water
it's really weird seeing you do this normally lmao
but yeah for future, that goron in sct is easy to make go away if you already did sprinwater ruish and have a bottle
I believe theyre in discussion to change time of day without crystal
cant even fan skip without wolf
two sword in eldin?? btich where
oh yeah you do have access to that now
the spinner check maybe? is that eldin province?
i had to do city vanilla yesterday i was so mad lmao
bcuz it bugged out, after i defeated the miniiboss, it wouldnt let me s&q out of the dungeon, so i couldnt fan skip since it already set the flag
yeah when i saved and quit, it put me back at that first chest on the left side
yeah but it was removed for rando, so it wasnt supposed to happen
idk thats just want nozz told me
twice the chance of it being shadow crystal
im sorry w h a t
the force is strong in Link
Link copying Zoro's No Sword Style LUL
yeah but i didnt think it also had sword hit box
are there other skills you can do without sword?
and not having a sword doesn't effect the damage at all?
it has its own damage value
Link never learned how to tightrope walk rip
I thought it was normally like red yeah
this is very black and white
spinner, wooden sword, boomerang, master sword, and iron boots now have color customizations
so thats whatever it shuffled to
yeah its the two new ones
for boomerang is it just the model or can the wind have new color too?
you can do like, 3 checks in goron mines
oh you got shadow crystal? did i miss it
oh wait yeah from aggie just now
i thought it was fused shadow for some reaon
so is the other bug not junked??
wait so bugs not junked at all then?
couldve had that so much earliuer
can get the waro here at least?
nope, and you just got lantern lmao
good thing you checked the other bug
it said eldin province, could be mines
is talo sharpshootiung and hawkeye excluded?
ah yeah i think it isnt province, otherwise the sign wouldve said 2 swords in dungeon
did you do the dcs in kak gorge yet?
guess we're going to gorge lmao
owl statue, dcs, and lantern check
did i miss where you just got that
it was in the rock on top
i knew there was smth good in there, just couldnt get it
so what's still needed? just iron boots and keys?
and you have rang, clawshot, and bnc can do snowpeak aswell
you are beholden to no god
could also just wolf jump it
oh I just noticed the hud colors are randomized too lmao
did you do hylain shield check?
oh but not on the map, 0/10 immersion broken
not alot of colors in this seed
i didnt see what color rang was
kinda hard to tell with all the wind
yeah i havent seen the kitty climb done yet, but it doesnt do much for rando even if keyshards were vanilla, as they reprogressive
I like how rando fixes the keys
well cause getting the last one won't just give em all to you.
what I would give for vanilla fast boots lmao
makes that section go 10x faster
you can do a glitch in vanilla for fast boots
does this seed have hyrule castle skip on?
yeah its one of the new settings they did, when you enter HC it takes you up near the top or smth i dont know, i havent entered HC in  a HOT minute
yeah im not sure ive not seen it yet
and i dont go to hc with bingo
but also map gltich who cares
yeah thers still one sword in eldin, adnt he other in Hyrule castle... somewhere
just talo sharpshotting and hawkeye if the grottos are junked
It is randomized but you have to choose free standing rupees
there isnt many, and the ones on snowpeak snowboarding seem a bit ridiculous to do at this time without any way to acrually get them easily without snowboarding 100 times
flight by fowl has a ton of free standing ruppees all over the cannon that fires you
thosre arent free standing, i the hologram ones?
there was a path hint that was clawshot to asheis sketch
have you done the checks in ZD yet?
you need midna to jump to the ZD chest
youre gonan go do argorock with ordon sword?
so that was double claw > spinner > shadow crystal > memo > sketch > sword
theres still one sword un acounted for
i mean yeah, but idve done snowpeak first on the chance it was there
you have great fairies tears so you could speed this up
if you didnt want to continue this auto scroller
any lantern checks you havettn done?
good luck on the rest of this cursed seed, im gonna go start my bingo
did it say there was one in hyrule castle?
good luck with your gamble lmao
renembering the context is even more cursed then the quote itself
so with the recent banjo tooie update it has a logic bug. top of mountain in terrydactland may expect you to reach it without springy step shoes making a whole region possibly inacessable
so the cake is a lie?
I WANT THAT IN SEASON 5 RACES
oh yeah i was working on a plando for you i should get back to that soon KEKW
i don't know the game well enough to do a good plando
KEKW ok this is a good plando
watch the real cake is on 60 star pieces
was there a new setting with coin bags?
what if cheato only has cake traps?
let me guess all have fake cakes
hey i was pretty much right KEKW
imagine moding this so cake mix is always mistake
it'd be funny if the real one was a random on one in a group of like 10 of em like on the bed maybe
don't have money? just buy a coin :P
i think I want to make adam play this too
or its a plando fake out
You know, I can't remember the last time I played or watched a seed with vanilla upgrade blocks
got new glasses perscription and the floor is warped and im dying
it feels better but im concerned on how every pair of glasses ive had has at least one issue
I passed out when I got home..
Im making Phantom play this silly seed LUL
How was the TP earlier today?
cant bake a cake without eggs
"I'm broke" proceeds to ignore coin lolz
Kitty gonna follow the laser pointer
reminds me of the poisoned cake in ttyd
I'll see you guys later evo17Hiyo
yes, you can deliver any 3 letterrs to parakarry KEKW
what did you get for talking to goombario?
i gotta step away to let pupper outside
damn didn't see that coming Kappa
This version of the tracker doesn't show it, have you seen a Bubble Berry anywhere?
Oh right you also need Bombette to get Laki...
So Kooper's Shell gets you 3 partners for the price of 1 YEP
Funny that today I got an early bday present from my sister
It's Sky Striker Ace- Hayate alt art QCR
Shocked that it's not a Cake
Trying to beat the hype before the deck goes up by a lot
Since the next box set after the upcoming one is confirmed to have a lot of new updates to the deck
but 7 is a lucky number
1 or 4 this fight should be free
you forgot to equip power plus
well the items could be checks too right?
so im in an async, someone found a shiny oddish, and someone else sent them a leaf stone so now they have a shiny vileplume LUL
i missed it, where was the cake?
And Whale was open from the start, yeah?
there was a hammer in shop too
first half of the seed looking for cake, second half fighting jr LUL
wow that was delayed and very poorly timed
game sets you up to tear you back down
I was gonna say snowmans nutty cake but this is faster
i thought you buy the shroom to cook a life shroom
iceblueBowserDance Being gmonDampePls here at this point is so crushing
i spent so many points on this stream LUL
shared a json meme in #shitposting lol

Im also gonna have to get use to a block button
Do you use the spot dodge?
Also I know you dont play rivals anymore but the fantastic buff are so nice

I think hes quote good now
They leaned more into his tank role and now he never dies
And he has a real ult now
Wait does fat Luffy do shit now
He gets the same bonus health from his big mode on ult
Hell yeah I've played in awhile
And the damage buff from last patch goes with that

He should give us all his stream key and we rotate every day
alright birthday bitches I'm satiated and now must sleep
I'm not a birthday bitch I'm just a regular bitch
I don't think my computer would listen
I love how I will no longer be able to go a day without someone asking me about ttyd rando
he posted a picture of flurrie in a shop for 200 coins
That's like real life when you think about it
where can I buy a BBW for $200
My lawyer said I can't answer that
I got stuck in the McDonald's minecraft ad help
At least I got grimace sadge
I hopr your day is good so far
I got flooded LULW my neighbor lost control over a water valve........
Makar is just a bean that makes noise when he walks and y'all hated him for it
well, it was dripping from the ceiling so it means everything between my ceiling and his floor is wet
yeah at least he got insurance
Well then the y'all refers to them
chucky hates makar so much he left the room
So did he swallow a triforce piece that's crazy
Where were you when barrier skip was discovered I was idk in class probably
whats retrothon? a con or an event?
starting on 4/20 tho, haha nice
when was your last gregar attempt?
This lives in spain without the a
Saw a guy do that at a Dennys once
exciting news on my effort to learn TP glitches, i was able to get Forest Temple bit/bite for ebf and im very proud of that
its good for bingo bcuz you can get boomerang right away
I cant do other BIT for EBF because i use a wireless controller
so i cant do the unplug strat
aparently the unplug strat is for 100% consistent bit
well fancy pants rich mcgee over here
i am not good at video games
but yeah with BIT for bingo you can get bomb, rang, and zora armor within like 8 minutes
also, your music is on the loud side
watch first run back you PB
Zora armor bcuz we start w gate keys so Rutelas gift is sphere 0 and vanilla
but then i remember trnarw doesnt exist
have a great rest of bday
When's the paper mario color splash rando
I was still under 2 hours forgetting everything lol
what the I lost a follower that stream LOL
Hey as much as I forgot shit I still hit my 1 cycles and greatfish swim so
I'm the only one who greatfish swims in rando because it is a very dumb decision but it saves me 10 seconds when I do it True
I use a follower tracker so im able to see who unfollowed, and like ten of the last followers i lost were bots whose accounts got removed
bots who hate ww hd rando
"Tell Risch I have 3 copies of trnarw in slots 2 3 and 4 and I have not drawn any of them" KEKW
Lan rubbing hhis face against the wall LUL
are we gonna see any missed swords?
And they said exe1 was the only game that you couldnt run from fights LUL
i been doing a ap and was gonna do ultra hammer skip in a little and just check my tracker and i have a ultra hammer now HahaSweat
this game does sound like ace attorney but maybe it's just the gba engine
chiptune music and capcom goes hard
funny you say that... just wait til scenario 4
isnt that what your supposed to do?
gl on the rest of your derust, im gonna go keep practicing bit and lbt boss door skip
i dont think thats what a trnarw looks like
I dont remember trnarw looking like that
Woah a streamer streaming a stream?? :O
So hard to find good help these days
Waddup, been a while. How's the derusting coming along?
well crayon, blastman didnt behave, and we got no trnarw
So in a super short and fun server update. This weekend I did a big simulation, and the longest one is expected to take 140 hours to complete YEP
The second longest took like 50
It's okay. You don't need to talk to him
omg that clip LUL  I remember that
"I dont know what this deos" is 2021 LUL
Alright first try trnarrow lets go
Have you tried making your man more mega?
The L buttons don't matter that much, just get lucky Kappa
If it looks stupid but it works, it's not stupid
This is giving me flashbacks NotLikeThis
Except for bathroom fight, of course
TrnArrow at the bottom calling it now Kappa
I am pleased to be wrong
a while back when legacy collect drop max dood did a reaction comparing bn navis with classic robot masters and he shit all over heatman being a zippo lighter LUL
he was really cool, he could turn your panels to lava to area lock you
rememberr when lava panels were a thing?
how many channel points for you to race komari?
I never imagined beatout having fur
Iceman has a fur coat LUL
Copyman has fur too, we just never see his real form
in bn3 time trails he takes the form of heel navis, then copies the one you fight so I guess heel is his true form
he has to have fur tight?
now im seeing reports switch 2 preorders may start on the 21st with accessories starting on the 30th. As if this whole thing isnt confusing already spliting up accessories will make it even worse.
i missed this, but on nintendos site it says the mario kart bundle is only til fall 2025
oh yeah i read something a bit painful yesterday lol
lmao, its only on 3 channels, one being fatkid KEKW
someone was wanting to get into the megaman series and so they started wtih MM1, and didn't realize you got anything really for beating stages
so they kept resetting after each stage
and was wondering what progression there was
they thought it was just 6 stages and nothing else lol
to be fair thats all ducktails has
i mean you still have the final run through transylvania again to fight the final boss
and MM1 does have progression, it's beat all the stages then the wily stages lol
and its happened again to me was setting up for pink station clip and mario just walk oob KEKW
Hope you're doing well Phantom, at some point I need to sit down with you to do some testing on capture stuff for Speedtember but hope you're doing lovely!!
Hype Trains are random sometimes now
the heck u were just at circus man. That stutter.
Bonus time is a go afterall
Kooper and his shell on this path
And a lost child on the path to Koopa village
How many partners was that within like 5 minutes
im doing as good as i can
King being down 1 hr in is still mind blowing
Damn, Tubba really upgraded the interior
yo phantom GL I dropped my phone in the toilet so I have no audio or video
Can I release the sequel to "Ideas that Zeli has that Phantom doesn't care about?"
trading ring pop for a hammer ppdagePog
Ok, I'll give you the TL;DR up front and you can decide how to react
TL;DR: A 'portable' solar setup that would allow me to use solar and normal grid power in an apartment without any modifications to said apartment
and I could take with me when I move
I mean, the catch is just that it's limited compared to an actual solar setup
So the set up I was looking at, I think its like $500 for the hybrid inverter. That's what lets you plug in the solar panels, and you can also wire it into a normal outlet/breaker for normal grid power. And then you can wire it out to a new outlet/breaker that you plug your stuff into
So the hybrid inverter basically can take the solar panels, give you AC power, or if the solar isn't enough, it'll grab it from the input
And then probably would spend another $600 or so easy on panels. That would be around 800W peak generation, but those are small enough they could be moved and wouldn't need a permanant install
And then IF I wanted a battery, I could, but the way I see it, the whole point of this set up was to avoid the battery cycles and just use normal power
So like the *original* idea that I thought could work in theory but is dumb in reality was to buy one of those solar generator power pack things where you charge it via solar and then you can plug stuff into it and use battery power
Like the Jackery or EcoFlows if you've seen those
The issue I found with those is that by time you've offset the cost via solar power you've basically gone through the rated lifespan of the battery
The bigger the unit the buy, the more likely you pay it back, but then you're looking at like a $3000 ecoflow or something
The hybrid inverter doesn't need the battery, it'll just mix as much solar as it can generate into the grid. The only down side compared to a legit install is it would only power the socket you directly wire to the inverter
But say I spent like $1250-1500 on this setup. Assuming I get a decent percentage of that rated 800W, It'd only take a few years to pay back, and the idea with this is when I move it's something I can take with me
And if I was ready to buy a home I'd honestly just look at getting a full grid-tied solar installed
Or something like this where maybe I can't sell electricity but I could nearly fully power my home
Where are you zeli that power is expensive? EU?
But I'm kind of in flux with my job situation and I don't think that's the best time to be buying a home
Then again *now* is not the best time to be buying a home LUL
@ppDAGERZONE in a place with a monopoly and a large cost to invest in new infrastructure YEP
And the bestest time? 80 years ago
90 years ago and then it's just not worth it
90 years ago you just bought the land and built it urself
Like what I'm hoping is my job situation stabilizes in the next year, and then in like 1-2 years start shopping
Honestly I wouldn't hate the idea of buying like one of those pre-fab tiny houses
as a renter of a tiny house yeah I'd hate that
ppDAGERZONE out here living on top of a 2x4
yo pp ty for the gl
yo blopez ty for the gl
He said a swift rando he said LuL
Oh how did the bn6 run go?
It's a good thing retrothon is super lax lol
I gotta do that with bn2
I always found it weird that it's an attack you're supposed to mash but you can still block it feels like those two actions kinda contradict each other.
Who needs mistakes when you can just miss the takes
also gg on MWSF, run was fun!
y'all did great together, was entertaining!
not sure about glitched but full 7 was hard to sub 3
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
oh yeah i beat tunic without using godmode
my home equity loan arrived so I can pay off my credit cards phanto274Pog
I too, am close to paying off credit cards
I need to cuz I wanna buy some Rogue Energy, it's been a minute
yeah I had more than 1, i wasnt very resposible lol
having a credit card to pay off credit card debt is brig bain plays
I had 2 then got a balance transfer making it 3 but helped lowerr interest
should I join a credit union?
I took out a loan a while back, to consolidate debt
I am WAY closer to paying that off than I realized
disclaimer: Phantom is not a financial advvisor KEKW
trying to pay off cards so I can throw more money at the loan, so I can be done with that
if Phantom didn't stream as consistently as they do, I wouldn't be subbed for so long
the over level 100 emotes are for the highest reached hype train twitchers
that is so funny that level 100 is a kappa emote
kappa looks like todd howard impo
I sharred the prices changes for switch 2 in your discord
Oops, idk why it autocorrected to gamers LUL
im only considering getting a switch 2 because my children practically destroyed my og switch
they need some positive PR for once LUL
im prob gonna try to preorder and see what happpens
the fear of prices going up down the road is a possibility
yeah, my last dualsense was 75
I am holding out for an 8BitDo Switch 2 controller
probably gonna see if my job has a bundle, but my financial responsibility's wresting with my desire for the new thing
last night I was in a multiworld and some ran super mario land 2 with 2600+ like 2500 of that was just single coin checks. We got tired of that very very fast
Disclamer: Phantom will not answer questions about TTYD APWorld KEKW
@Axl_SR "Will not", or "Not allowed to" ?
BN has such lovely NPC ladies
Shout outs to whomever brought back Ms. Mari for BN6
I hope they got a friend
@buff00n I meant "raise", not "friend"
fatguy is streaming it and he said it can run on nintendont
that the same as running on swiss right?
especially when one of them owes you rounds of ice cream phanto274ColonD
alright good luck, gonna tab out to focus on other stuff for now
At first I was like, your PB had a 12:30 BlastMan? Then I saw the time at the bottom is 2:37 LUL
Tbf, 12:30 BlastMan could still theoretically sub 2:20 :)
Honestly, I wonder how much I would remember, I don't think I've run BN6 in 2 years now
Just like A vs. C coded reflectr
So you got tails twice Sadge
And probably bug frags and something else, but I don't remember
You were supposed to gun the yellow one earlier from the side
You were just one tile away, and decided to go Sword it instead
It's from a kinda awkward spot, I've messed up movement trying to be there many times LUL
I must lurk. I have to go collect what belongs to me.
ive counted 59 in the past
yeah JP Kelliams shared a story about how he got yelled at from Capcom for increasing the text box count but in the end he got a pass cause it didnt increase the games size.
yeah, he had no help with that stuff and had to figure it out on his own
you may recognize the anme if you playyed the bayonetta games
yeah he was more involved with 2
he posted a seminar vod of what it was like working at platinum, lots of interesting stuff in there
We LOVE Tree of Judgement's music
gl with the derust runs metall2Eyes
whats the plan after sunday? Focusing on TP attempts?
I ran a poll in komari's once the results were overwhelming that chat didnt know exe6 had sky gauntlets LUL
i dont remember telling you about my tuesday
I stepped ouut for haircut, then bbestbuy for xenoblade x and tales of graces f. Noticed tires were low and upon filling last one the stem popped out leaking out all of the air. Luckily i was 10 minutes from home so was rocking the donut
now i need tire funds phanto274Smile
hey dont be hatin on zippolighterman
there should be a NCP for start with area grab field
Note for myself: 3PM pizza in the oven
wouldve been a really cool nod to classic if while chaud was undercover, protoman was also undercover as breakerrman
right syncro is all counter hits
the way you can zip across the stages is neat
i watched some bn6 pvp yesterday and was impressed
interesting i dont see any gold splits yet youve got a tons of time save -6min
i dont really get how the little badge in the chip slot works but turned you into beastmode or something
seems kinda easy for a boss but i dunno haha
kind of a really cool area
Anything is better than C code reflectr and MachGun T
Imagine the 93% failed runaway on turn 3 tho
I was technically live two days ago rischSmile
Uhh, I struggled to get a run going, then the last attempt died to no ZapRing2 B
i was going thru the bn3 post game but once i realized i could save scum the chip trader i got bored
I even tried to get it from the chip trader Sadge
Do you mean using save states to save scum?
BN2-6 save the game for you when you use the chip trader
i mean yeah just reset till you get a chip you need
That only works if you save state, yeah LUL
Though it does work in BN1
The old "no manip" category let you do GMD manip LUL
AKA save in front of it and reset until you get a good enough reward
good afternoon i just woke up like an hour ago peache114Yawn
i heard y'all americans got your switch 2 preoprders back and nintendo is eating the cost of terrifs to sell at cost, which is neat. But still no news on when we are getting our preorders back :')
As long as you don't grab both the Regup and CopyDmg, you're typically fine
nintendo is eating the costs of tariffs?
yeah, theres still a10% terrifs imposed on all devices, so nintendo choosing to sell at the same price, eating the 50$ that wouldve been terrif extra, is sellinbg at cost
as the console at cost is 400$
the console isnt made in china, theyre made in vietnam
all the acesories are made in china however, which is why price went up i think
idk man all i know is they better not change the canadian price at all we arent imposing any tarrifs i just wanna drive as a cow man
theres a link in phantoms discord, gaming channel
NO T ANYMORE IT ISNT LUL
well heres what is dumb. "electronics" are exempt from tarrifs
but the siwtch isnt considered an electronic????
ofc, those ceos cant give up their 30th yacht, what kind of poverty are they supposed to be sdubjected to??? /s
2 of those seaside encounters didn't have piranhas :)
nice to see risch keeping count for me
wish you could hear how hard im laughing
youll get it back during moon stone
so I was gonna join a async tonight but something happened
I guy posted yalms for 1 sunshine, 2 wind waker, 3 OoT, and 3 yacht dice. AintNoWay im joining now

Sometimes we make sure there are green numbers
what happens if i tell my robot master to sudo rm rf */
AUR NAUR TWITCH ADS TELLING ME TO GET MINECRAFT MCDONALDS
L-L-L-LAVA CH-CH-CH-CHICKEN. STEVE'S LAVA CHICKEN YEAH IT'S TASTY AS HELL.
does my robot master have root. who do i go to to get my megaman rooted
Which battle network game would LAN throw popcorn around after seeing the Chicken Jockey
can we have the -40 minute splits again
so you have to still do the peach parts YEP
watch me SWOOCE across the NET
Is it not the most exciting part of the run?
I'm still debating if the idea of "randomized EvilSpirits" would be fun or not
Yeah, it'd have to have some sort of logic to ensure it's solveable
I'm also now realizing that it wouldn't even like, have any value in a randomizer. Unless you were to force it to have a location check or something
I'm literally staring at github repos, seeing what I'd need to do to maybe consider implementing an open BN6 in AP
The other one would be weird, because it'd need some sort of flag to trigger it. Unless the default world state is "Central Area had EvilSpirits"
Clean GBeast will do that EZ
That was some chip combo luck
Well, you weren't wrong, this one was technically closer than your PB LUL
Glad i came in time for this boy am i a network homeboi!
Had to go into the office today phanto274Rage
gotta say so far despite what we had worried, I am impressed at the state of TTYDR
those prologue related things are rly just "you gotta renember the sequence to check the checks" and not "you gotta actually play prologue"
currently midway through a seed PrideFlower hence sharing
havent gotten to that place yet
had to run through like 5 chapters just to get flatten KEKW
cus without flattening no tube mode
I was gonna say, I know I don't play much pape, but Chapter 3 was in fact my favorite part of TTYD, so that being vanilla might be a tad disappointing LUL
Been while figured I'd drop by
I might give it a go if i have time this weekend
I am assuming ch3 would be like that given I ran into ch6
the "good thing" at least w chapter 6 is that its not locking you in fully
like - you can at any point just go back out and it doesnt create stupid crashes
cus I mean - ch3, 4, 6...
like - I got ch4 P missing
ch3 I am basically "Just" missing the ticket to enter
ch1 I am missing a key which I am missing ultra boots for cus its up on the moon KEKW
6 is just a piledrive of "do this do that" - currently missing the diary
I was trying to remember what 6 was LUL
I heard of something related to peach cutscenes
didnt run into that cus I dont have a maptracker rn, just going off memory KEKW
and its not giving me the power cus the stars are not progressive
the good thing at least is we got hold B to skip text???
Doesn't n64 pape get rid of those in rando?
rly hoping the cutscene stuff which doesnt do shit just gets skipped soon yea
but like - not judging that its currently not done
like with "ohohh new area cutscene" type shit
the stars NEED to be progressive
cus TTYD is STUPID dumb with those
like - from what I heard even dumber then Pape64
it'd be neat if you could like swap to playing as peach and then go to different spots to do the different intermissions but I don't think there's really enough item locations to make that worth while also it'd prolly be a massive pain to code.
cus out of order you dont get the star powers until you loop close yup
which essentially means you#re running on sweat treat for forever
there are effectively reasons FOR doing that effort imo
I mean it takes effort to make a randomizer lmao
I ran into pit for a key at floor 80 chest KEKW
you have to manually junk afaik
and default is "its just on"
cus you can be in pre hooktail scenarios
without good danger setups and shit
yea - but that also assumes having tools to kit into
which you dont necessarily have for rando yep
like - in my seeds case I got lucky getting all the mario danger setups
BUT I didnt have spike shield, had to run on quake multibounce and use flurry to gales away flying spiky enemies
I have a shop with power plus
then ALL the mario danger badges are also in shops
so like - you just turn rougeport upside down for 5 minutes and hope to find bobbery
badge shop, whatshisface (charleton is star pieces?)
and then the one in rougeport center all are not
but yea those 3 are not rando'd from what I can tell
Is the lottery randomized? :P I know the answer is no but it'd be funny.
normal shops are and badges can absolutely land there
star pieces on shop slots can dupe for no real good reason
and then to see the next 4 you gotta room reload
the GOOD thing I guess is you being able to get coin easy at least
so its not TOO too bad
but its still shit either way
only 4, no clue if he got random random on his display
but all his items are also in the pool
so like - I got 2 slow gos KEKW
getting mega rush quickly is like speedyspin
that's just such bad game design lmao
and you can only really influence it if you are able to buy out entire sets
which 16 / 4 => 4 inventories
which each slot can be any of the items
No non-TAS RNG manips for it?
Bust my ass like you mean it
cus you're super tight on coins
based on having seen who else got their hands in TTYDR
just asked exactly about that name in dms KEKW
they also did the complete chaos shuffler thingy with the 1hour challenge stuff
dunno what that would be called rly
but I have seen it a lot KEKW
I mean - github wouldnt tell me lies would it tippiGiggle
okay do you want to cackle
my grotto key for keelhaul was in creepy steeple
which I had to get the paper curse for cus I couldnt tube up without it
which THAT was behind nonsense chains on the life shroom in hooktails castle KEKW
and now behind grotto key on the first panel is where I get ultra boots KEKW
I will take holding B for text over mashing
yeah AP for solo randos is so trash
also yea charleton seems to be full random like vanilla
so you said that getting back to the moon could be rough without the teleporter being pre-emptively set active?
well, good thing that room is active in my case then tippiTap
cus the coin crane game room is not clear KEKW
dont have the cog for it
when beating ch7 without having beaten ch6 before, both sets of cutscenes inside overlap KEKW
and it just auts the remaining bits of the train section as done KEKW
time to see if its set up smart so I got the shit in my inventory at least KEKW
Hey all gl on segments practice
So pumped the countdown is nigh
still got no koopio and it was behind a post ch5 check on wedding ring KEKW
Deadge psn plus went up they want 109.99 for a year over here
it was 94.99 last week Madge
to add (better free games) to psn plus
i just wanna play online Sony i don't wanna play your free games sony
tunic was free so that was cool i guess
idk why sony cant just make a plan where u don't get free games but u can play online and use cloud save
cuz that all i want Madge
so... you are allowed to do some of the glitzville things out of order
walking to the respective in between mr x story points just triggers the steps
100% get ya on that bit
just currently peekin at ch3 with most of the seed clear, so wanna reflect the things PrideFlower
having played MMOoTR - I am okay with very early stage rando having none of the QoL you rly wanna have in rando cus yea
good thing is you can skip most of those things now in emerald rando afaik?
at least in respect to the magma / aqua hideout thing you can set it open / closed
yea ok - glitzville is still storygated bc of the league thing in that aspct
bets you can skip most of the other things out of order, but that specific thing to get into the champion room for the macho grubba fight is locked
which I could see being doable
I mean - the multicoin blocks already work
the troubles havent been touched YET
but I reckon thats doable too
the big question imo w glitzville: do you NEED to still do the whole "appeal to the crowd" thing
or can ya just steam roll
cus while annoying to do 20 fights
if I can skip conds, that'd be neat
will see once I get an annoying once
but also like - set me to be at the fight for spawning yoshi
then lemme do the couple ones to get yoshi and then skip to the fight v rawk
ok immediate test of the cond stuff I mentioned
I dont wanna sit there and tank 3 attacks KEKW
you dont have to do the conditions
I get you, but I wanna say glitzvile without conds is already a decent improvement step towards other things
stupid conds still ahve to be done NotLikeThis
whyyy did it let me rise rank on the thing and then say "oh yea no"
ez thing to do: set rank to 14 or whatever it is when yoshi's egg spawns
make us rise to 11 and run to get yoshi check
then fight that and rise to rank 2
all the other things can be done out of order already
yes, it'd still be 5 fights, total including rawk
but like - if NOTHING can be done about the whole yoshi egg waiting nonsense, then that'd be what I could see as a decent acceptable
its not about whether the egg is out but about if the egg to yoshi get check needs those fights to pass or not
thats what I am thinkin about there with rank 14 to 11 cus I renember it being like 3 fights where you got the egg on the bed waiting for ya
so "best worst case" imo: you get to get to glitzville with the egg just gettable getgo, which the egg normally spawns at rank 14 or whenever it is
then if it really can not be decoupled, make us fight the 3 fights til the clefts run to make yoshi spawn
if its nothing but the rank being the rank shit
then yea make us spawn at rank 11, let us run from it for yoshi check and then use the clefts fight to ascend to rank 2 in one go
so that its just the minibosses which are there
best case I agree w that PrideFlower
also dont know the code behind ttyds shenanigans ofc
"but if its somehow stupidly tied to nonsense like other delivery quest style items are in other games" kinda thought
I was stupid on the star power things btw
it apparently does just work how you'd expect
just the str power meter thingy is completely and utterly confused about everything
thanks! haha all good focus up buuuud
stream was good finished a super hefty OOT seed, ended putting in 10 1/2 hours in it
i split it up into a couple days tho lol
Oh so its one of those where u nail a trick and u use a dif route.
I did a late multiworld last night, finished at 330 so woke up at noon, and just now woke from another nap
If you go over just make ice save time lol
I know you don't actually run but it's still crazy jugoomba beat your sob by 10 minutes
My bad, I meant to say "actively run"
When you fight g beast does g beast have navicust buffs?
big time improve though from yesterday
risch fire up the stram bro xdxd
I'm getting some chores done today
And doing more BN6 rando research
Someone did some more research for AP, so I'm kinda just piggybacking on that now
I popped an edible during the early hours of the morning. That's how I'm celebrating, I guess.
Yes let the Holiday gifts coming. Fave category with my fave streamer.
there's a Lucina figure going for pre-order. Fuck me.
my dream figures for this yr. Super saijin 3 vegeta and ss prime goku
model kits are usually more my bag, but I have exceptions
Oh snap I forgot to check...
Last model I ever did was just to finger tiring and a sweatful over a gundam. I still have it unfinished in the box.
I need model kits for Beast Out Gregar / Falzar and Command Mission X
That would be funny if it did
I have a TTYD rando run going and it's been better than I expected for a first release, still a bit buggy though
My issue with ch3 at the moment is the bugginess, though trimming off some of the fights would also be helpful
Again good luck on this run on this Easter day
It is possible to get stuck in a loop of getting sent to the locked room
Couple major issues that will need to be fixed before I want to do more than one run but I think it may enter my rando rotation soon
Until/unless I decide it's not worth it but I've been having fun with it so far
Right now my biggest issues are bugs that prevent completion, namely getting stuck in Glitz Pit and being unable to return to the moon via cannon.
I didn't even have Bobbery the first time so I got stuck without even being able to do any checks lol
Everything on the surface is in a cracked rock
Nope, not a single check without a bomb
I mean, it makes enough sense to me but different quirks of different randos
IDK how precise/hard it is once you know it's there
See, if I saw it on the tracker with those items, I would probably try doing that but maybe that's just me
Yeah, I'm personally in favor of adding things like that if they're easy and make logic more interesting
Notably, iirc Ultra Boots are pretty low-value in TTYD normally so allowing them as an alternative chapter access seems like a healthy thing
On the "not needing to look up anything" point, TTYD has much bigger failures than slightly unintuitive logic currently...
Hidden blocks are always randomized, in logic, and aren't visible
No way to leave panels vanilla btw :)
Only checks you can turn off atm are the pi
Anyway, still a bit rough around the edges at the moment, but looking forward to seeing it progress
@AngelLove94 yeah, but that's nothing unusually
So apparently I won't be able to do my solar project Sadge At least not as planned
They restrict any type of solar panel unless it's integrated into a single device
It's also nice that when there are mod bugs that get fixed, repatching on the new version fixes them for ongoing runs
Yeah, so like if you have a lawn light that has a panel or something that's not restricted, but anything larger than a couple feet requires a permit
But yeah, it's a bummer. I'm looking at another option where maybe I can do a smaller set up
What is the bot doing LUL
I haven't gotten there yet but I hope chapter 8 isn't a pain to get through in TTYD rando, that could be a potential pain point I haven't encountered yet...
Yeah I think tracker says I have all the ch8 items already
Which is why I'm worried most seeds will just be really long go mode...
I'll just have to see when I get there how desperately that chapter needs to be shortened
IIRC there's some stuff in ch8 that seems interesting on paper to be randomized but if you have everything going in it might be a pain
We'll see if rando separates that sequencing to make that unmissable
Apparently I started typing and then I forgot LUL
Oh right I think they have a way to raise the staircase
So the main reason I find it so ridiculous is that even using like a portable battery with a solar like those things you see at Best Buy would technically not be allowed
I think someone mentioned that and they already have that as a feature
Like the ones you take with you camping
That will be nice when I decide I want shorter seeds but for now I don't mind
6 isn't too bad with the fast text imo but yeah, 3 could afford an option to skip some fights
Those major fights should definitely be required, I don't know if the whole chapter should be 3 fights but 20 is potentially excessive
I don't have a problem with them inherently but there is an open suggestion to remove the "wait X turns" ones
TBF in rando they might /sometimes/ be good early game XP but...
If you fight them too late it's a waste of time
I think it's just paper mode, yeah
A little interesting that you can't enter any chapters itemless
Tube mode and Letter and Yoshi or  take the pipe
I believe there is a way to skip Contact Lens through the sewers as well to get to 4/7 early
It's not Bobbery though I can't recall what it is
I have a hard time remembering the sewer layout
Oh it's Bobbery or Tube Mode that lets you go through the town
You can roll under the bombable pillar
I mean, movement is probably the biggest thing 64 has over TTYD
(The TTYD movement being bad makes the linear level design matter less imo)
Curious what about the toybox makes you say it's open though?
Trying to think how TTYD compares in that regard
Glitz Pit the progression is completely separate from the checks
Probably a bit long atm but separate
Haven't been to the tree yet in rando
Ch1 fortress can be skipped if in go mode
You can skip most of the Steeple if you have everything
5 and 6 are pretty linear though you can skip Station checks
2 and 7 I can't speak to too much bc I haven't entered those dungeons yet in rando
So TTYD probably isn't that much worse than 64 in terms of being able to skip stuff on the whole
What run would require the most RNG?
What category requires the most skill?
I assume ppl at least used to care
Given it's on the main board
The least ran category is plain any%, right?
It was Reverse All Cards before normal any%
But which is more of a meme between RAC and Glundo?
(I'm inclined to agree, the 2 should maybe be swapped)
Bow is used twice in Glitchless?
Goombario is only used in Prologue and Chapter 1 first half, right?
Wow, Goombario is useful post Chapter 1?
I had to leave for a bit but I came back to a Peach cutscene and it just reminded me TTYD rando still has those as of right now
I'm so glad PM64 rando cuts out as many cutscenes as it does now
TTYD also cuts out... an acceptable number for a first version as long as it improves with the rest of the rando
I don't remember what vanilla Prologue looks like in TTYD
You fight Blooper if you take vanilla route to ch1, yeah
Yeah that's almost entirely cut out of rando, Frankly still offers a tutorial upon giving his item but that's about it
"Tired of getting encounters" is me playing TTYD rando lol
Poor movement makes it hard to dodge
We'll have to see how much worse it is if I get a run where I don't start with Yoshi...
Even Yoshi barely feels faster as a movement option...
It is minor, I have to assume it's largely for visibility reasons though
The perspective of these games isn't always the most conducive to visibility in that axis
There's the one screen where you have to climb... every time...
Fun walking past those guys 50 bajillion times
That's a nice QOL for remake to add
I can see why it was needed YEP
Have you played with new stuff yet?
Panels with I Spy and hints or nah?
You need I Spy (either the option or the badge)
Concrete hints spoil the item completely
I know you set Kent to already defeated but for future, if you set him to already paid, the enemies in that room go away now
It's mostly if you want to dodge the enemies and/or have the option to kill him later
I think so? I haven't been paying attention but I think lots of races have been happening
did you plando a strange leaf into your inventory for this? :D
I mean, it was 2 per matchup in the group before, the groups are just bigger now
check if the lace is loose. or else you gotta tie it
Partner block shuffle, coin shuffle, star pannel shuffle iirc.
the first 2 were the big annoyances.
Overworld coins are fine imo, it's the blocks that are problematic
Because you pass every overworld coin anyway
Coin blocks being spread out is the problem lol
good afternoon, im just getting ym day started
Have to remember and adjust routing in at least desert and sewers
im dropping a lurk, today is my affiliate anniversary so im going to set that up, but happy 4/20 haha day and hope the run goes well!
overworld coin with LCL was problematic if there was no chapter 4 cause yeah lots of good stuff would be thrown in there. Also combined with partner upgrade shuffle meant you could not have fully upgraded partners. Like I remember a seed where Phantom had a fully upgraded Watt but no Watt and was using an un-upgraded Laki cause Watt and the Laki upgrades were in chapter 4.
what are the S4 rules even?
Yeah looking at the preset on the randomizer site that's what it looks like
And now panel hints are suddenly less useful
Prevents unnecessary backtracking and as a side effect, shows if you've checked it already
Race settings make getting danger hard enough as is
This week is alliance Insight sneak peek
Goodbye about 22.50 to get that
Unfortunately you have to be in a shop to open said bag
@Darkness3827 I put a Crystal rando on the living room TV and saw a comment about hitting up the herb store, so seeing someone ask about Pape herbs is funnier to me
Diamond Stone and Magical Seed, I think?
all this buried treasure in the desert
Not like randomizing regular coins doesn't do the same thing
There's no bias against the random coin rings/piles
I guess it's harder to navigate efficiently than the other rooms but plenty of rooms are as dense or denser depending on settings
Like it's the same number of checks as Tubba's bed
its 4 20 on 420 YEP
i jut thought of something funny imagine a 420 rando where all items look like the mysterious leaf until you pick them up
and in that 420 rando Mario have red eyes YEP
im a very happy high person right now because i can watch all the baby bunnies outside my window
You can Parakarry from the right
Maybe even jump up from the right depending on cycles
I think the game may want you to go to 7 Hmm
ok good thing you did 7 1st KEKW
hey i think you miss something in that shop but idk what that was Kappa
It was, thank you! was just playing some Paper Mario as well!
I've played since I was a kid but this is my first time playing it in a looooong time so it's like brand new to me haha but it's my favourite Mario game for sure
Not like you can run danger anyway
Was the Cake Mix needed anyway?
I guess I missed you cheating in toybox the first time
So that's the first logical clear
I mean, if it's Tubba or Palace it's the first logical clear
You could get go mode here
could we grind of the bullet bills?
so hopefully the bill blasters and the koopa bros help
hopefully these guys give good exp as well
its bowser run for our lives
nice and close to leveling up
so the last level up you need is bp right

i see 4 20 rando was quick
i got an air fryer today and i cannot believve that i can make fish in 10 minutes its unreal to me
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I didn’t wear sunscreen yesterday and I got sunburnt 😕
nice I wish mine would do that
I went fishing yesterday that’s how i got burnt
I’ll just need to remember to wear sunscreen next time
Wish I can watch this at my PT
pereorder a switch 2 grip last night
Yo phantom nice to meet your face! Glgl GoatEmotey
Today is the sneak peek day of Alliance Insight so I'm going to go to that
Why does it feel rare to see the slap be the thing to knock him off lol
G A M E O V E R Y E A H
Like I think anecdotally less than 1% of the time
last night i ran TP AP. Its fun but dont like all dungeons being forced to open including hyrule castle
it ran great for me tho, all items werre sent
I will say tho hyrule castle open is safe for a 3 hour sync
i only did like 38% of my checks and only entered 2 dungeons
i just want fused shadow settings
there have been people that have done absurdly big ones yeah but generally that's the optimal size.
the group i play with overrwhelming runs DK64
ive been enjoying the 20 sync groups
getting 20 people together at the same time sounds like a miracle lol
other thing I enjoyyed about TP is I dont need thee map tracker. I run pop tracker for broadcast view auto tracking and universal tracker client for showing all in logic checks
there's an AP discord and they have some massive asyncs like there's an official one that's 3000 slots. Syncs tho yeah I think the biggest one I've been in is like 50 generally they're like 10-30 in that server.
yeah, offical syncs are cool but the only offical game i know is emerald so ehhh....
Yeah bc it's what most people run lol
I'd really like to watch more glundo but bezos tends to ad nuke me on monado's streams rip, and even that's just Glitchless any
I don't know if anybody is streaming glundo rn? Which makes sense given length
Speaking of time for me to download tp practice tools, just finished homebrewing yesterday
@Axl_SR in the AP discord you can do unofficial games too, I'd say like 70% of the games or so allow unofficial ones, I don't play any official games and I can find games pretty regularly.
The only person I can imagine really enjoying transitioning to tp glundo would be mini, since he already does ww runs that long
My personal goal is to be *pretty* good at something nobody else wants to do lmao
At least it's in the same key lol
oh yeah I exclusively play unofficial aside from pokemon. I was referering to the "official only" groups the discord does.
eh it's not the worst effect in the world. I love getting poisoned in FFV or FFVI the screen just goes all pixelated every time you move it hurts my eyes.
Ive been playing banjo non-stop so wanted to try something else. May try metroid prime next
Easy he's practicing his best in show vaulting
I hope he gets the puzzle ok 🥺
Prime AP has progressive beams so plasma > plasma charge > flamethrower
Hey, won't be here super long but how goes the run?
I hated this puzzle way more than the ice block puzzle tbh it hurt my brain
Do you mean the snow peak or the heart piece? But I getcha
phantom what graphics settings do you recommend for dolphin? Was getting a bunch of artifacts with TTYD
@loonysuzee I mean the really annoying optional puzzle in the cave yeah.
i ran vulcan for TP and that was fine from what i noticed
@Darkness3827 This puzzle was 100% way worse than any of the ice block puzzles
Were you able to pre-order a switch 2
I got mine on best buy, I was lucky with how fast I got in
my targeet order is still safe, its wild that everyone was calling target the worst but I had a perfect experience.
Pallos, I was done in 6 minutes
I got in the best buy queue like 20 seconds after it opened
I was sitting on the website like 30 minutes early
Im guessing y'all got the bundle
Shoutouts to cali tax for making it an extra 55 bucks for me
Bro he got a booty on him
Oh so dogs can break the fabric of reality
phantom, idk if youve tried TP AP but every check is a greg. So every location you get 1 ruppee added to your count then it sends the item
Like i went to sacred grove and while there I peeked the bug location OH YEAH EVVERRYTHING IS A GREG phanto274Smile
I could overlook that if at least fused shadow was an option
at least you can skip cutscenes unlike TTYD LUL
Hey! Your message is being checked by mods and has not been sent.
I would say my least favourite even in this game even
shouldn't of had such a good PB then :P
@Draconif Hey! Your message is being checked by mods and has not been sent.
do sinkholes happen where you live or is that a non iissue?
one of my neighbors in my community had a very small one in there front yard like a year ago or so.
right, it literally says [Shop Items (include Citadel Gorons, Coro’s Bottle, Barnes Bomb Bag)]
This mini boss is the worst because it is annoying and gross
im confused on these Drehen season 2 settings. Golden Bugs are in the pool AND have their source check excluded, yet agitha rewards are excluded
i was just looking as I havent seen this rulset before
okay, it was a typo in the docement lol
bugs are not in the pool
risch is making procress!! Tried to go to seaside. Megaman says "Access Denied (needs fish)"
Oh boy the 6 month alert
I don't think I've ever been so early in my life
doing good just thinking about what to play next
Doing alright for now, probably gonna be soft resetting for shiny giratina in platinum while I watch
I'm at 2118 encounters so far after 2 days
I'm using speedup so probably 10-15 seconds per reset
yikes. I never bothered with shinies in pokemon.
Hey how was ur break and do u have a link to ur battle network run?
holy BALLS it’s a content stream
Yo I’m the yellow Poe now LETSGO
That always happens KB1 is a bitch
Early game in allot of Zelda games is the hardest part so that makes sense
You should see the no hit strat for him. It's such bs
Ok I'mma pop over to peaches. Enjoy, glhf
Everyone seen djc the tp guide is the more insane
Why do you get that tear before basement bugs?
Ohh cuz of early canon I forgot
Usually we get it after leaving basement but I always forget you do early city now lol
that's my whole life rn with this game
forest temple music is a vibe
i lost like over a minute on this in both runs i did today
actual brain exploding moment for me
1st try we got a run!
Good luck for runs buddy how is it going ?
next thursday will surely change all of that COPIUM
i still bet 80% of my stream would be TP, glitchless is just ingrained in my hands
out here hitting the 10% chance on the big stage
I'm back from eating lunch, I see we have a good(?) run going
alright snack time fuzzyNom ghunNom HypeNom obiyoNom phanto274Nom
Shantae Advance, still no sign of a release date for modern console so I get to check it out early.
i havent starrted it yet, i can stream it in your discord after i finish saturdday AP tonight
plus with it being limited run games i imagine it wont be long until it gets dumped.
gonna run TP again tonight, dont feel like doing banjo and I already have TP setup
It's nice to see how optimized the twilight sections are, considering casually it took me almost 30 minutes per, especially the case for eldin twilight
what aree the post temple of time checks again? all i remember is impaz
Not a raid, just wolf !!!
Not a raid, just wolf !!!
Not a raid, just wolf !!!
Not a raid, just wolf !!!
my legal name is Darkness3827 actually.
just a minor fyi. the fontsize on the splits is very tiny
im watching on a 50 inch tv
i imagine theres a setting for font size
gm gl and hf gmonWiggle therea1474Wiggle
i think you said the statistics were like...80something percent?
i keep getting side steps on randos a lot...makes me frustrated
do you think Link constantly had a wedgee from all of the rolling he does?
horseback is gonna be miserable then
i know he wears tights...underwear? eehhh
Sorry about the Bo part...it's major bs
Yeah...I'm gonna let you focus on the gate
Link is determined to not let you proceed
phanto274GL with all dungeons dude... push off bo like a fucking pro on this one
that goat turned so fast lol
it’s all to learn that nothing really matters
It feels like the GBC one, you have to travel to the dungeons. The dungeon layout reminds of the platforming style of wario land 3
do you wait for the head to be down before the regrab?
I know some people also wait for the head to be like below the middle and also facing down if that makes sense
but also eel just is eel sometimes
like not worth the mashing effort
and I was watching gc runs a lot before I started running
like sometimes I’ll be watching and for a second think “oh no they’re going the wrong way”
no not at all but I’m so curious
I’m sure the beginning is similar to what I run
oh jk there’s a clawshot split early
do you need to do pillar clip?
say it quietly, the game is listening
I am working 2 - 10pm
I have to cover a co worker
I just opened my fridge and the bottom shelf came off??
the one will ALL the salad dressings
so when limited run games does a release like that does that mean it doesnt have to be rated by esrb?
brb while I reassemble my fridge
most of the runners do but I do an easier route
I don’t do the epona seam clip or oob stuff
you have to put the lantern away between attempts
what happened there on your pb?
it felt like longer in the moment
it’s always good rng in practice and always ass in runs
like literally right in front of you
why do you do that midna call?
have you seen beests clip of his like 25 hop ook
it’s a good one, I’ll see if I can find it
are you okay if I link it here?
yeah I’m curious to see gc ft
Yo Phantom, did you see the news regarding the Homebrew Channel for Eii?
the final monkey chain is only triggered by saving the monkeys
and if we do forest bit it softlocks you out of the second monkey so can’t do that either
It discontinued development because one of the dependencies it used was made up of stolen Nintendo SDK code
The Homebrew Channel devs are pissed
They straight up said "The Wii homebrew community was all built on top of a pile of lies and copyright infringement"
I would hate to drown OoB
the game heard you earlier saying that you like pillar clip
that’s fair and the practice is good
How did morpheel treat you yesterday? 🥺🥴
Hey mew! 😁 My kitty says HALLO
Awwwww you remember his name! chaoti128Blankies
did I spell it right? is it just geordi?
Yeah it's actually just geordi, like geordi laforge. Wasn't gonna mention it first time tho bc I was just happy you remembered GlitchCat
SIR MY LEG IS NOT A SCRATCHING POST
okay I will keep that in the brain vault
big nap time for me, gl with the practice phantom
Glgl napping mew makes sense after ur 4-5am yesterday 🤣🙏
Maybe a 4-5 min stretch break for blood flow phantom?
I love having to stop reading a social media post halfway through because it's clear the person doesn't know what they're talking about
4 encounters, no 6 cap, double mole dink, but 4/4 cannons and peril 5 final
only if it gets into gdq
otherwise i'm just gonna do real pb attempts
but yeah i think mid 3:42 is pretty reasonable, low 3:42 would be a really good run
maybe 3:41 with a god run but idk how realistic that is
yeah it doesnt sound real lmao
Today was my first day in the business, i got 15 buck off from homebrewing someone else's wii
Wait i don't think that's how you say it
Eh whatever, you know what i mean
Have you tried out the ttyd rando yet?
Yeah same lol I'm waiting for a bit more QOL to go in
i got up before my alarm too but it was because my new neighbours were smoking outside my window at 7am Madge
god very tldr but my landlord put in an illegal suite below us and it's so bad we are moving
over 5 years on a lease that he's just deciding to break YEP like we have to share our patio and garbage cans now and he yelled at us when we told him he can't just do that
and the people downstairs have a 1 year old and a yappy dog
Oh yeah we are gonna be sameish area
Yeah it's really expensive to rent but it's gone down a bit. There's a lot of new apartments that have gone up in the last little bit and they're begging for people
Okanagan isn't as bad as vancouver but it's still more expensive than like 90 percent of the country lol
I can’t stop laughing about last night KEKW
yo mid how is elde inn Kappa
It’s slightly better but I have to practice it more NotLikeThis
im fine thanks, I hope you aswell
you just made me remember I need to finish that documentary on garfield lmao
I want to read that when you’re done KEKW
from the internet anarchist I think, great video
Oh I thought you were making it LMFAO
it's monday the 28th, canadian election day monkaS
nah too lazy to do content notabl19Dd
Yeah I have to help the seniors vote today lol
I crawled out an igloo when i was born
KEKW I like my mom but she's fun to shit on too
Yeah it ruins the mentality lol
Tbh you should’ve had the phantom bot comm for you last night LUL
I think the "safe way" for goats is a scam
That was your first mistake KEKW
You should see my z1 attempts lol
Thank you SEGA for not offering Switch 2 upgrades for your Switch ports
can I target the fucking child
wait is that the monkey's name
As a general rule i do not trust monkeys
yeah they either steal from you or tear your face off
i love the monkeys in this temple, tp forest is best forest temple
it shares vibe with WW forest temple
Phantom, I just willed into existence a check to appear in the mail
I'll try, but I promise nothing
LITERALLY just sorted the mail, thought to myself "I'm not interested unless it's a check for me", then sure enough: check for me
You can pre-order Fortnite for Switch 2
lmao at best buy 1 holiday season they sold an xbone that "came with" fortnite
@gothiczelda I love free pack in titles especially when they're already free
@SeventyFourTG hey you might get like 2 skins!
there probably a free vbuck code in there
i had a vbuck code from a PlayStation bundle i forgot to redeem YEP
Im dropping that here randomly because I have been watching your pape rando vods for like 30-40 hours in the past few weeks KEKW
Just get Splash to do youtube stuff and pay him with exposure
Dont worry, I am only like 1 year back in vods, theres a lot left to watch
I would LOVE to hire an editor, I have 0 desire to edit vods and stuff myself it's so boring
yeah it seems just like it takes a while
The speedgaming twitch channel has been live for 48 hours because they're unable to end the broadcast for some reason
:/ I'm sorry to hear that dude...
I got a second switch2 for my cousin. It was weird, I went on walmart at 3am and it was normal. It was like buy any other item on the site
walmart says day 1, and my original target is week 1
My job's selling Switch 2's, no pre-orders, 1 console per membership, and you can't buy another one until 7 days pass
i do like that way of handling it
This calls for a scam train
today i figured out how to back up my GBA games
I tried link cable first but ran into issues
it was. I’m just not in a streaming mood today so I called it early.
might go take the dog on a walk.
if you do I hope your walk is good. have a great rest of your day
you were nowhere near far forward enough
yeah there's rough cues i use but even still it's kinda precise
only saves a second over rolling into ooccoo fwiw
yeah if its only one fyer rupee
fyer rupee is 4s for the one, then an added 8s for the second one iirc
But did you lose time to Stallord?
Yep, it's a tp run alright
maybe after i hit a mil i will actually finish my plando
Hey Link you gonna get your sword back btw?
@blacktiger51 Gosh darn thats a nice amount there.
so, Link DEFINITELY pries the Master Sword from Ganondorf's chest, right ?
I'm at 371K. I've got those rookie numbers.
at work rn, half-assing this training video
I keep forgetting to get this to practice ljas
this is a weird place to start a speedrun
What's the one that always gives you trouble?
i bullied my coworker into giving me his 4060 after he upgraded to a 5070, and im very content with my choices
going from a 2060 to a 4060 will help with streaming lmao
why the fuck is jolteon knocked over, help em up
but yeah in bad news my grandma fell and broke her hip today so shes at the hospital awaiting surgery phanto274S
so ya know, win some loose some
so like, yay new graphics card, also my grandma has been crippled
Hearing galaxy music with this screen is funny
does AD run use ordon bridge back in time?
Noooo I was enjoying that one xD
yeah i want to learn ordon bridge bit bcuz the new French Vanilla rando seed makewsa it difficult to get to ft right away, so i need to learn a new faster bite
well i wont have to deal with a rock  as the gate will be open if that makes a difference
okay so what are we doing here walk me through it (at your convenience)
@peachedpocky okay yeah that makes sense
why did i reply to you im sorry
Then where the heck did I hear Randall from
but yeah as long as i can get to that menu screen and move around im good, i just need it for EBF
so as long as i save and make a file before doing that, i should be fine
Peach you like unintentionally explained why his name was Dwayne lolz it's fine
basically you need your own save file to load, if you use the bit file you loose shadow crystal
@AnniLyn2 oh yeah no i get that, but i didnt mean to reply to you with my reply to phantom haha
Okay so there's Dwayne, Greg, and Hugo
Gonna call that monkey Randall now
yeah like when i do ft bite, i enter ft, make a save, do the thing, get to menu, jump off, get to second part with no menu, jump off and *die* then when you git continue it puts you in king bulbin fight
so you reset in the cutscene, load your file, then youre back in ft but ewbf is active
I know Ook has a name...but I'm just gonna call the flower monkey randall
yeah its used in any% i think?
except they use the bit file and we do not, as that will save over our rando progress
i also need to learn reverse arbiters, as the new seed settings are basically cant warp to a region unless you've visited it before, and itll make getting spinner faster then having to get through first half of arbiters
yeah its easier bcuz we wont have CoO warp, and will need to grab memo to get to desert, but once we're in desert we can warp to mirror
I need a nap so bad rn
ive been up since 5 am for work
I fell asleep around 9 just to wake up almost 2 hours later for PT
Alright...the moment of truth after he stops talking
Why must you be this way Bo
dangoro as wolf? i hear that causes problems
Ordon causing you major probs today
bo is just being a BITCH
yeah wow hes being exceptionally rude today
Id buy Bo a beer, he is a real one
you need a not 8 minute bo
So far into the game :/
the fact that it gives nothing is fitting, as i cant NEVER DO IT WHEN I NEED IT
oh ok might me mod  only?
If you take a breather yeah
Sorry that Hugo is being dumb :/
Okay cool...imma go throw trash away rq
oh I did not know this came out
Ooooohhhhh I had a friend mention this to me during my stream yesterday!
Not sure if it said risky revolution...they just told me about it lolz
Idk why chucky looks a bit chunky today lolz
I have also tried to get my cat Cheeto to speak into the mic to little success
I'm here dancing when I gotta throw my plate out lolz
Going to Vegas to see Jesse D: Going to Vegas to see Chucky :D
I own multiple Shantae games but can never find it in me to commit to one
I own the Wii U one and only played it up to the bath scene
Is it a GBI specific issue?
I did see them developing this game using the Analogue Pocket
dropping a lurk and taking my newfound ordon bridge knowledge into bingo
I think it's built with 8bitdo controllers in mind
I don't have the dock I use a MiSTer for TV stufff
Have fun with this one Phan...gotta keep that blood pressure at a good level
I just read that LRG had to recall that NES Rugrats game they put out because it was damaging consoles
2 out of 3 ads had like... kickin ass music lolz
woah ive never heard of this shantae game cozyne2Pog
Come back to more catchy music
oh that would explain it KEKW
Haven't used it in a while
I think I heard reports saying Switch 2 pro controller has a better d pad
pirates curse is the best one imo
I'm gonna head out lolz I actually wanted to play this one xD
Apparently this cancelled GBA game was supposed to be the game that introduced all of Shantae's new friends in the DSiWare game
Oh yeah lets rock i with he genie pirate
oh i always shantae always knew rotty but just never talked about her KEKW
Like she just acts like she knows her
Thank you WayForward for releasing a game without auto save like the good ol days in the year 2025
love taking a bath that's 1 tile deep and 5 tiles long
Wow this GBA game was ahead of it's time for caring about lost media!
how long ago did you switch over?
some things have taken me longer to figure than id like but im enjoying it
you played any of the other games?
im jumping between this and the original
the para-laxing clouds int he sky look really clean
I wasted so much time looking for this room
oh no we hit dead end
it whows them on the pause screen
they had a lot of ideas
i have no idea what that does LUL
yeah the routing is interesting cause I didnt find crab until after this dungeon
if you miss it like I did the game does hint it at least
i hated this room so much
I had to let Hikari out before my race with Luey
lol they all look the same
btw if you speedrun this its free WR KEKW
wish me luck on my rando race I dont wanna do lol, id much rather watch this honestly. At least the vod will be waiting for me lol
1.3k then i can redeem randomiserrr
how does reedeeming ranodmiser work with when u do it?
GIGASPIDER so we now apart of the bug species
me thinks u enjoy being spooder
oh nice there a ps5 version
You still gonna grind TP All Dungeons or are you taking a break?
All right hope you get out of your mental block soon
Darn missed ending. Hope u have a wonderful day and biking was sweet
Doing pretty good today, how are you? phanto274Smile
yo star! isnt it great the fifi has returned to streaming again fifiBongo
you half done with this game btw
I can tell you if you need help, this was the final part that stumped me
i need to see the map list again lol
naga cliffs what the second dungeon where yyou used crab to open it?
yeah im pretty sure its at naga cliff
after transforming if you press L and tranform back to Shantae you can press L again to quick transform back the the last animal you were. Its useful for swapping underwater.
i joined the shanate speedrun discord just so I have a place to talk about htis game LUL
i dont know why you had a problems with this on GBi, it ran fine for me on everdrive.
I haven't gotten a copy yet.
I did some speedruns of Shantae 4 a while back.
oh! i remember what to do next now
what, elephants can't read signs either?
What a relief! Thank you for freeing me from my prison of ice!
wowie zowie? Daisy is that you?
i thought that too at first
but I went there first cause its a fast place to check
Everything was fine until the clown nation attacked
are the other Shantae games this funny?
I assume you have to unlock the stomp in this one?
its funny how it expects you to figure out how to break the ice, then holds you hand afterwards
i want a money glitch like that
my teacher told me to talk after class and she told me I revived several noise complaints
I’m calling my 1st born Cornelius Crust
ambergris is some sort of perfume
dont kock it til you try it
I think I have an idea how he got crushed on his wedding night...
"haunted" implies some things to me.
can you climb background walls with spider
i think thats how it worked on GBC
im in the middle of it
You need another transform for it
you can cycle thru your spells without pause by holding L
hopefully that boss wasn't a good indicator of the entire game
hair doesn't pick up the drops?
I saw today I saw a pending transaction from target switch 2, wonder if they are actually taking it out now
i see gems in the wall
This location without map is so annoying
platforms so brittle a spider breaks them lol
just got home from my fucked up little circus show that was my day at work
that room you were in stumpt a lot of people on discord lol
Imagine if that text box said, "Its a key, but its broke! Find the other half to mend it." KEKW
you can move the cloud around with your hair
TS OOGIE BOOGIE FROM KINGDOM HEARTS!!
remember, the one professor did say crust was a dinosaur LUL
i forgot to come back for that lol
reminder: you have a game pack
so I had a really easy time with this, the 2nd one was very easy to find. And the third one was an item I peeked off screen awhile back.
that was the one I peeked, you can see it from the ground by jumping. I saw that my first visit here
i never found the harpy talon
i noticed her attacks are the moves you get in pirates curse, i thought that was cool
that didnt happen to me lol
it has a percentage at the end
Why did WayForward make this for GBA? It can't even output at 4K!
ive also heard this has a magic mode too, so more magic with less HP
i wouldnt be surprised if they are waiting on limited run games for a physical switch version, thatll be another 14 months lol
whats your opinion on this getting into a GDQ before the HD version drops?
Not on GBI that's for sure
it runs fine for me on GBi
have no idea what happened when you started this
yeah i new version dropped last night
you can see items in the shop now
oh im talking about Pape APWorld
it says at the top of my launcher
ive had to add a tone of clients to it for the games ive genned. like DK64, Luigis Mansion, Sunshine, Skyward Sword, ect.
lol how many times have i heard that lmao
don't you know chat logs are the replacement for dedicated wikis?
are we doing banjo tooie!? phanto274ColonD
it goes to player > templates
did you pout the apworld in the custom foler?
I had that same issue with TTYD, I had to ask in discord for the yaml
is the documentation only in discord?
oh... "what is a yaml" tells me everything
pleased to report we did not make white people tacos for cinco de mayo
are there communities that accept speedruns on a pocket?
or does it count as emulator
@graample from what I seen it's seen as a separate platform usually listed as MiSTer
oh, this rando is very rough. skip to grotus doesnt evven set the flag for grotus. The solution is... Fix for palace skip is /set_gsw 1708 14
ive seen softlocks due to missable checks
how many chapters? if you use limited logic you have to guess which onnes are in
Thousand Year Door was my first paper Mario game.
oh yeah, game doesnt tell you which the black key it is so good luck with that
Have you played the remake of Thousand year door on switch?
entering and exit frankly is a check too
at least we can hold B on text lol
also bowser and peach is not skipped, if you are quick enough after touching star you can pres L R Start to warp to start skipping it
I'm just glad this is a thing now.
ill be glad when its a thing later lol
Yo I'm here and right at the start too!
are you playing this on gamecube?
im prob gonna dip out, walk Hikari one time then figure out what I want to do tonight
I guess you don't have a tracker layout yet
have this been updated yet or are we gonna see the peach and bowser parts?
Well I gotta call Majora's Mask Randomizer, but before I go.....
Back from my outing to see bonus content nice.
Not until you talk to Flurrie
It is interesting (don't remember if I said before) that none of the chapters are open from the start
Yeah it really isn't, is that the default?
Yeah I'd honestly go like 300 in this game lol
Partially also because shop prices for progression aren't currently as cheap as in 64
At least you can sell badges for big bucks
Yep at least you don't have to walk back
I couldn't remember where Chet was but convenient that you started with Bobbery
I guess it's not that far
I haven't played this game enough to know which partners are good to upgrade lol
Did you buy a lottery ticket?
I had to learn to be careful not to die in the overworld monkaS
Movement is slow which also just makes hesitating that much worse
Plane has checks, Koops is used at least once (though Yoshi can also work for the one I'm thinking of currently)
You can hit the timed switch with Yoshi but it might require taking damage
I know it's not in logic regardless though
Ah good call, get a little bit of chapter 1 progress
You can do town and Fortress but not much to the left
Oh boy that's 5 and Heights
6 but only the end of 6 which isn't a lot
oh snap a new paper mario rando
That's helpful, you can enter 5's dungeon already
I don't actually remember where the pipe is if you need Yoshi to enter the dungeon
Boat, Yoshi, Handle, you also need Vivian or Tube Mode later in the dungeon
Before the sailing section at the end
Most of the answers aren't hard
Yeah I think the only hard questions there are the shop ones
I think you can now get to a dense room of the sewers
You can't get to the left normally here
There's a hazard respawn for it I think but that's it
Do you do 5 first or 6 since there's less stuff there?
which paper mario game u like most
Buying from the stall is a check and there's an item behind the stall
The inn is also a check
is this the one they put on switch
Looks like it might be a bit before we escape sewers
World is opening up so much
Each Whacka hit is a different item btw
There's an open suggestion to have him drop all items at once
ive lost track how many u have done
Haven't beaten a chapter but most chapters have been opened
really want u to appreciate the blimp tho someone DESIGNED it
Well that's the rest of the chapters YEP
Be sure to tell Grubba no to being a fighter
Because it's in logic immediately YEP
Huh I guess that one doesn't matter
That's the one that's in logic early
Yeah you have to do a couple fights
see u in a hour after fighting
I gtg, probably be back in an hour-ish if you're still playing
u didnt equip the thing u bought bunch of
u got kooops so do koops chapter?
u can get vivian but u have vivian
pretty sure you just normal mario
So Phantom, are you attending the funeral?
Dreams of Solar wasn't here for a long time, but he was here for a good time
I think the long one is after beating chapter 5
You just have to watch the long cutscene again
I was wrong last time btw, there is a grand total of 1 check without Bobbery on the moon
ohey I finally caught u online again \o/
you've also been streamin at early o clock and I've been working
I also haven't been able to make a lot of the earlier streams so I'm glad I'm here for this
There's one behind Bobbery's chimney iirc
Where'd you end up getting Yoshi?
The jump wasn't hard, was it? I haven't had the chance to try it yet
I think the apt comparison for me is Blue House in PM64
No, just getting to 5 through Blue House
Yeah, cola is just for Bobbery check
It did used to be tho
I was going to ask where you needed Plane mode but then I remembered you need it to even get to that side of 1
Yeah the checks in 3 are mostly separate from story progress
This game certainly has a vibe to it I guess Justin brings his own flair to it. I guess im so used to pape.
my lentil (not taking full credit) came out great if u want it grab a pita and put paprika.
Checks for every fight here could be interesting, yeah
IIRC if you just keep doing fights, you don't have to grab the egg
I know I had Yoshi to start in my first rando and I just did all the fights in a row
You don't get stuff back when you kill those guys
That might have been changed on Switch tho
I know the game sometimes gets a little confused when you win this first try
I remember needing to redo this fight at one point but I don't recall if it was because I missed the condition or because the game just got confused
We're on route to chapter clear #2
There are also the 2 checks in Grubba's office YEP
And maybe 1 in the locked room?
This happens sometimes, just roll with it
Maybe save though just in case
I haven't seen it causing issues but Zeph says it can crash sometimes
Yeah, there are those warnings which can supposedly lead to a crash but I haven't seen it myself
TBH I can't believe those guys are still in the minor league
how goes it? Not seen much TTYD rando. looking forward to it.
It really is just 45 minutes of fights, huh
okay, I've thrown stream onto my laptop
It might be the next room actually
I thought so too, let me double check
Okay I guess yeah, only in remake
Not that I can see on MarioWiki phanto274Shrug
What species are Grubba and Tubba?
are clubbas only in the PM series
So apparently normal Clubbas are only in PM64 and SPM
I forgot how many cut scenes this game has… jeez
isn't it just set the story flag as   complete for the peach and bowser stuff
given that this is a Nintendo game… who knows? they do some weird stuff sometimes
Shantae Advance already found a Sequencebreak for Lab 1 that might be able to save some time
how many stars do you have?
that lines up, I saw someone do 5 and it took them 10 hours to reach credits
with ultra boots you jump up to grab the pipe then land on the ledge, then jump to the platform. This lets you reach ch4 without yoshi and yes this is in logic
whats your overall opinion so far
and no way to turn them off
yeah I dont think this game will ever be good for syncs, it feels like an async only game
id love to be proven wrong tho
this doesn’t feel as rando as say, a regular paper Mario rando. maybe it’s just these long exposition scenes…
64 has been in development for 4 years now?
The game does have LCL already so I think syncs could be viable once there are less cutscenes and an indicator of what chapters are required
Obviously PM64 minimal is the standard of what would be ideal eventually
But I'm fine if it takes time to get there like it did for 64
yeah it does have LCL but if your group wants to be done by the 4 hour mark how many chapters is that?I think doing 3 plus grotus is pushing it
That I'm not sure, haven't played enough
I guess it is still pretty slow
i just know TTYD is a very long game and I saw someone take 10 hours to do 5 chapters + skip to grotus
also grotus flag is currently broken
Phantom have you played Super Mariomon yet, or plan to?
Id be surprised if you ever played a pokemon hack LUL
could blow them down the hole
I think it would be cool if Emerrald AP had a gym rematch goal
what in the pikmin is going on lol
can't tell if that was relief or annoyance
Plane also lets you finish the outside of 2
4 hrs of bonus content it mus be my bday early
OK who of you bitched so bad for mashing that holding B allows it
It would've happened either way so fair KEKW
You're not missing any partners besides Mowz, right?
I don't remember 100% what all is required
I think you have at least 1 card
There are 3 for the 1st door and 1 more later
I also don't remember how many of the train fetch quest items are required for progression in rando
We'll have to see when we get there
I'm sure you got at least 2 levels in the pit, right?
Oh right I forgot you need that for the cannon
Did you sleep at the inn here?
There are 4 total card keys
oh my god its my fav paper mario game
idk i have never played ttyd or this rando
aw god the sound effects hit so hard
Blue is the last one required so you need both others before any of them matter
he literally said nope im out
Do you have all the castle keys?
I don't recall if any are skippable but probably not
What it is that rando changed
i think its like a softlock prevention but idk. doesn't work really if you have ultra hammer
i wonder if you used vivian in there if the timer would still kill or if it would just sit there forever
As much as I would like to stay and watch you finish, I need to go to bed so gn
I saw you got items for Palace still
It was funny!  That's all that matters
is this gonna be in your rotation going forward LUL
Def a great time but imma hitting a wall. GL on the rest.
the least they could do is you enter the room and the potion is done
there better at least be a setting to remove this stuff
i def wouldve worked on this more before releasing it, he prob gave in to people asking for it
i have a shantae clip to share, dropping it in #speedrunning
there is a panel in the engine room
im gonna get some sleep, eyes are heavy
Ah yes, you must be Waluigi.
It was me, I killed whacka... he looked so delicious.
@TomaThePolliwog I'd fukken do it AGAIN
Whats the verdict up until now?
marios walking speed is slower than the cutscene
would you say you just got your shit.. rocked??
I dont think there is anything cleft to say about that
the best prize pool ive ever seen
I can't wait for there to be randomized quiz questions from completely random genres
"What year did Britney Spears sell the most singles?"
TTYD rom that is just a romance simulator with TEC
Your loudliness! I've come to report the Seven Plus Eleven is having a sale on Sweeter Than Sixteen donuts. I-- WHERES PEACH
the no music kind of makes it funny
is the station key idk in ch8
ok well you have fun with this YEP
hooray i finished my project now i can soak in this game
are the pianta parlor prizes randomized
i just thought of a terrible joke.
this is a weird game state
vivian has 10 and marilyn 12 iirc
damn nice necklace flurrie should put that on right away
searching threads on discord sure would be a nice feature huh phanto274Smile
@Spinthra tomath9BunLooka but how does that  increase our stock value
joining the discord and then immediately leaving the discord
i wish things were wikis again
there should be like a decentralized wikipedia
what a crazy way to find out
not doing chapter 8 is my favorite part of pape phanto274Smile
also I love expedition very much and I hope you'll enjoy it
yeah there's like aaaaaaa uh 15% chance that whenever ads play - my laptop just brainfreezes
I haven't gotten very far but it's a good game
the game is gud. I've heard complaints about the story from people who've played for 5h but lul
the music is loud at times
better adjust the music to lower to hear the voices better
I have all but one achievement with ~60 hrs
40h if you don't focus on 100%
yeah and it's just getting a party member to lvl 99, which I haven't felt like grinding out for doing ng+ for lol
30h to finish is very ambitious for a first playthrough, I think
also sms camera, so I can't do any other way KEKW
what do you mean left right isn't right left
biggest pet peeve is when games combine that camera option for both 3rd and 1st person, like no, bad
btw, I lost my job (company is broke) so I'm gonna have time to sleep and draw phanto274Howl
We hear music but not voices
Did you accidentally bump the in-game voices slider?
is it like an HDCP thing??
if it thinks there's several speakers then this can happen, yeah...
the controller is a speaker KEKW
Was there something wrong with your Switch?
I yes I had that happen to a 3DS of mine
well you're not the first to have this problem
"I went into my sound settings on PS5 and started turning things on and off and eventually it started working again. It's like the game kept sending voice audio to the headphones even though they aren't plugged in... Strange"
yeah, restarting was what I would have suggested next as well
someone else mentioned changing audio format if that doesn't work
it was at the bottom under sound
they mentioned changing it to dolby atmos, even though that makes no sense KEKW
you're really selling me on buying the console with no games
anyway can't wait to get a Switch 2
okay, I'm gonna switch to lurk mode since I've been procrastinating on my freelance moonlighting articles
my 1070 can run it on all but lowest settings :)
My favorite PS5 exclusive is the Sonic Racing network test
Say what you will about Sonic 06 at least it remembers to load the dialogue
yipee I love moving HDMI cables
quick, download more ram and play on pc
I can't believe you didn't test if voices would be muted before starting stream smh
If you give someone flowers say absolutely nothing
my streamer can’t even find them
can't believe the devs didn't think of retrotink smh
you need to add an alert for the French cat clip before next stream
my two favorite games I've played in the last year are both french rpgs, which is odd lmao
voices are very low compared to you
I guess console has auto-run by default?
my steam friend list has been taken over by this game but this is the first time im seeing gameplay
the impatience of French people fuels their running speed
On PC, I didn't know there was a run button until later
so is this game just mario rpg, but protagonists are french instead of italian?
I've described it as persona + paper mario gameplay with a nier vibe
it's like nier if nier had good gameplay :D
I wish Xenoblade played like this
Its just French Xenoblade I loveit
With a different combat system obviously
that would be a xeno spoiler tbh
But yeah this game is great, it reminded me so much of Xenoblade 1
Gave me a lot of the same feelings
Wait did you beat this already Justin?
So far, this game is great, reminds me of Xenoblade 1 if it was fun Kappa
god damn how long has it been out, I can't keep track of time any more monadoFlatten
Hot take, I'm sure, but I just didn't vibe with that combat system and this feels much better
Okay that's not crazy long, feels like a good amount
i got the platinum a couple days ago
you won't believe what the 33 stands for
Nah that's fair, 1 & X have a pretty different battle style but that's why I like it
The best way I'd describe this game is Xenoblade but with a Persona & Paper Mario combat style
You will very likely enjoy it
the overall vibes are closest to hier replicant
this game did kick my ass a lot
oh yeah the autosave is very aggressive
Any game that places you close by where you originally died is just good design
do you know much about the story going in?
Have you finished it yet JCog
like do you know what the 33 means KEKW
@Monado yeah I've all but 100%ed it LUL
heavily considering speedrunning it, just need to start learning
Not him saying something creepier right after KEKW
oh, yeah last I knew it was just over two hours
first run was by the CEO LOL
my 2nd run was fast af
Well.. all I'm saying is that if you liked the story and characters in this game, you probably would like Xenoblade JCog 👁️
I might, but the lvl grinding makes me skeptical SadgeBusiness
oh its should be open now
As long as you just do questing you don't need to level grind
it's been on my maybe list for a while
Yeah exploring the world rewards you by giving you experience which is nicer
damn i could get world record on console no 1 posted a run
Most PC runs just use them
yeah they also have a bunch of cheats already lol
you missed one angry lady in the middle of the
I talked to no one in Prologue KEKW
I have a hunch this one might be different too
I know if I were a girl I would be
better work on my lightning skills so my wife doesn't leave me SadgeBusiness
gotta get some balloons to practice too
frick this sounds like a lot of work
You can inspect the trash can this game is french Earthbound
I feel like it matters a little
the artstyle feels like a fever dream
now imagine if the ad came in the middle of the dramatic death scene
I liked the part where the singer went oooooooooooooooooooooo
That part instantly made me think of 3 lol
I thought it was going to be more visceral tbh, I'll take them turning into flowers
homecomings hit different when you're french
I'm fasting, no drinks and no baguettes U.U
These games are just emotional trips
I love games that make me cry
there's some kind of liqueor that goes really well with milk, makes it's taste like sweet vanilla milk... want now
@Monado you should play In Stars And Time PAUSERS
@JCog I've heard good things about that too
yeah was about to say Kendal will also vouch LUL
Oh that's not bad at all
nah it's a very good length
lmk if you play it, I want to watch PAUSERS
Will do! I can stream it to my second channel
I still need to export my vods from that
I don't wanna lose my first playthrough of Xeno 3, but I've been lazy
best play the ad before you leave this scene later. wouldn't want to pull an EA KEKW
no card game side plot 0/10
you can undo the haircut, lol
That's the tradeoff of good RPGs, its either french or british
I really like the voice acting in this game
there's one voice record where a german voice actor is imitating a french accent... while speaking english of course. My ears bled
my friend played the whole game in French dub
I wonder if it's possible to miss this journal
nah you have to talk to the kids and maelle
british but actually Jennifer English Kappa
pulling off parries feels so good though lol
When I saw this game all I thought was, no wonder pape people are loving it KEKW
DJC and Glitchymon made me addicted to this watchout phantom.
Phantom doing their best Michael Jordan impression
you can remove it in the menu
the French and guillotines, name a more iconic duo
In Fire Emblem New Mystery of the Emblem a unit will offer to shave your hair upon recruitment and it's permanent if you accept
pretty sure it's cause this is a prerendered one
and expedition 33 was never seen again
@JCog At least on PC, cosmetics in cutscenes is an option
love that they say fuck but shit stays french
yeah they're having a very not good day so far
if they had merlon this would've gone differently
You actually missed something, this was the bad ending and you have to do Prologue again
just you wait, the whole game is beautiful
yeah just cause it was prerendered
was a lot more noticable on my 1070 KEKW
Wow, what an obscur(e) looking game
He's at 1HP, of course he's seen better days
uh oh he's in peril where's the beeping
Instead of beeping he just has blood on his face
Revolutionary! Finally a video game with jumping in it!
wait, is that the alt uniform color
The elixir has a shower included it seems
ok, I missed that one actually
Bad game, next you'll tell me you can't pet the dog
or the dog will be scary and we won't want to pet it
If there are no dogs then we can't pet the dog, for there isn't a dog to pet
they don't seem very good at acupuncture
maybe look at the damn murder weapons all around DUH
I made a joke and they all died of cringe, my bad on that one
god he's waving the white flag already, this game is very French
She makes the enemies dirty, so they will go and grab new clothes
btw, a thing I noticed late was that pictos give basic stats as well
just wait until you find last stand
ff7 remake and rebirth do do that
tales of graces had titles that would teach skills, basically like pictos
I like how that's what you point out while she's literally flying lmfao
You'll see her feet and like it phanto274S
you get stat reset items, so just use the points tbh
yeah that's the recoat you see there
they're not super rare, assuming you're not using them constantly I guess
oh my god this is Paper Mario
fun fact, if the rank is A or S, it scales faster than might KEKW
I enjoy the dudes but I can accept Lune being called pretty
I also really appreciate that there's no random variance to damage values, other than crits ofc
man, the enemies agree too, they keep attacking Lune
they've got it out for our girl 😭
Not me using Lune for most of my playthrough cause of her running animation
Makes sense they keep attacking the tank class *checks notes* wait I'm being told she's a wizard
Everyone else looks so goofy when running
who is Mark and why are we applying him
Maybe you'll get stone edge if you skill rock slide Kappa
oh just a heads up, resting at the flags works dark souls style where enemies respawn, but you get all your consumables back
it is so easy to amuse you
I died to this guy so many times 😭
two attacks in one turn? peepoLeave
she told you to dodge smh
Oh shit that’s a sick attack then
okay, on that note, I'm gonna evade my butt into bed. Gnight!
Alright, heal and grind it again phanto274ColonD
You’re taking to heart to improve your lightning, the girls will love that
but just dodge the attacks and you don't need those 4Head
why dodge when you can parry
in case you forgot this game is french
Surely there are only 4 more turns of light screen and reflect left
Actually JCog I forgot and now the mime makes sense again
Okay game of the year, this is going on the wish list
the absolute whiplash from your whole expedition being wiped out to fighting a mime for baguette
well when you put it like that LUL
You'd think that sentence would surprise me but it doesn't
most of the time if you see lights along a path it's the main one, which I wish I figured out earlier lol
why doesn't the sunglesses emoji show up when I type :sungl ??
they were fine, this is the smart move
you can't apply them yet, but the game will tell you how when you can
“Feel the burn” Lune or a Jane Fonda workout video
rest point and a wide open area Hmm
Deku Tree if he went mad
oh just now it feels threatened
I wonder if he didnt absorb the spider from the kokiri village to let ganon walk from everyone if he didnt get a nidge to meet Link by a higher power if he could have ended the saga right then and there. Heart choices are such butterfly effects.
god that attack is strong at 10
I would stay there if the tree mage attacked me
what if every ability was absolutely broken? love to see it
oh oof, that'd be rough lol
Okay they’re even more sick now
and suddenly it's dragon age lmao
this is exactly what France is like, they did a great job with the historical accuracy
I've never been there so I believe that now
I have so you know you can trust what I’m saying
Europe is very small and easy to get around
it really is, this is why they have a lower drinking age
From my perspective, non Europe is weird
wait, how did I not put this together with all of the paint. this is the indie Super Mario Sunshine sequel
for reference parries are the equivalent of a 9 frame window at 60 fps
I think dodges are like, 13.5 frames? less sure I'm remembering that correctly
under the sea? is this the live action little mermaid?
it would be really funny if there were two doors you could open and one was wrong
no face man doesn’t talk? shocker
I have her beat there 😎
actually in a ponytail I think it's about the same now that I got it cut
My hair is similar length, might have to do a high ponytail for a more accurate comparison
this ballroom was inspired by lies of p
okay yeah in a high ponytail mine comes down to a bit below mid back
yeah like two months ago was the first time I got more than split ends cut off in over four years lmao
okay so she’s Aegislash with King’s Shield
The lore is so epic and juicy!
this guy is even more French than anything I’ve seen yet
I definitely thought you were going to get one shot lmao
how does every damn pictos get even more broken
@Amishman19 Do u have this or u getting it?
@stavros12c34anenoglou I don’t have it but I feel tempted to get it, looks fantastic
cheap game that better then 90% of games nowadays
the liquid affects are just awwee
oh shoot you got a cool new sword
you get two phone calls and miss 15 minutes and apparently miss getting all the cool new stuff
God is the music in this game good
I tried making my playlist have less game osts, but every time I do that a game like this drops :_:
one of the few complaints I have for this game is when it makes you platform in a game clearly not designed for it lmao
when my wife has to focus on a task at work she puts on a playlist of just Coconut mall, you are not the same
At least it only makes you platform like 3 total times
I have one complaint about the game, and it's just that you reach damage cap too early on
did you know roughly 1/7 people have a foot kink supposedly
holy that’s way more than I would have thought
I think the stat is 14%
I mean, just in this chat we have amish and me, so that's like 2/4 current chatters+phantom
I see you're in the "vibes and feelings stat allocation" club too
You do get a lot of the Recoats, so live your life
I maxed ur stream so much my headphones blurped out LuL
I thought this was french, not american, gustave
okay as much as I wanna keep watching, I'm on a granny schedule and must sleep
I've already stayed up too late BabyRage
it's not even 9 cst yet
lmao that seems fair this game has me losing track of time just watching
I'm debating if I should try n' hustle some people in ComboBreaker discord, some folks are gonna need rides to / from the airport, so I *might* be able to make a side hustle to my side hustle
oh he’s got a trumpet that makes way more sense
how you liking the game so far?
awesome stream, have a gn everyone!
best strim ever at an end
how mad will you be if the YouTube upload pops off cuz the foot in the thumbnail
@langepon "why would you say something so controversial, but brave?"
average Costco member staring at me as I pull chickens out the oven
@buff00n have you played the game?
as a follow-up, I found the exact quote btw:
"The best source I can cite would be the data I collected for my book Tell Me What You Want," [Dr. Justin Lehmiller] says. "I found that 14% of my participants reported having had a sexual fantasy before in which feet or toes played a prominent role."
that's not info I'd willingly offer
1/7 is so oddly specific for feet
and kinda funny considering this game
it's also much higher in men compared to women, to absolutely no one's surprise lmfao
only issue i had with this game was entering a area will sometime fuck the movement up for like 20 seconds
I play on ps5 and never had the sound bug
it's so odd you get it twice
I saw some people mention it could be the monitor sound settings?
technically they said TV, but still
someone said online switching to  Dolby atmos will fix it
yeah if it doesn't work, let this cutscene finish and retry after it
yeah don't mind me then lol
do you actually have 7.1 channels? is it possible audio is being outputted to non-existent channels?
supposedly the underlying problem is it trying to put voices on a nonexistant middle speaker with surround sound
like idk why or how that info helps though lol
i never got this but i did play on a headset all game
it also just seems very quiet here
well, guess it's time to voice-over all the lines yourself
can you try put the audio to chat only and see if the av amplifier stops being greyed out and then set to 2 channels?
someone said online resetting the game settings to deafult resolved the issue
low-key I'm exactly the right age to be in expedition 33 lmfao
like I turn 32 next year
yeah i also turn 32 next year monkaW
we would've been killed on the beach together 4Head
is that like, her showing them her feet
lune and maelle are my favorites happ
red-green colorblind people be like ????
I think you came out a different entrance than you entered
this is apparently also a french reference lol
some well-known game in france, idk
oh if you ever want to force an autosave, you can just change equipment
you can even change it right back without leaving the menu
i didn't know that and i have the platinum KEKW
I still need to get the lvl 99 one
my highest is 92 I think and I'm worried ng+ is just gonna be a cakewalk papeHands
what happens if your party wipes from them falling on you...
working but here for the lurking, hope you’re  still enjoying phanto274Hype
phantom every time they get a new picto: wait this is illegal
frankly all of the new pictos Phantom gets are illegal, they’re too strong
tbh that doesn't stop the entire game lmao
I was honestly really impressed with how well they paced the enemy scaling the whole game too
it also seems to do a good job of making you feel powerful but not making the fights too easy
which I think is different than what JCog said but maybe I’m overthinking it
that is different but I agree
you're just trying to get her caught up on xp butter15Fine
wait do these things essentially self destruct on low health or do you have some thorns effect now that reflects damage?
idk what game i should start next Deadge
offense is the best defense, rite
phanto274Baguette <- this is also perfection
I feel like that might undercut some of the more emotional cutscenes NiceSoftlock
that’s the hair of a 4 year olds mangled Barbie
btw try to get 4 of those mini guys asap, it unlocks a skill
I think you can get 4 of them as soon as you unlock the 5th teammate
Anyway, you're ahead of me now so bye lol
the Gestral just realized it was French
guess some expeditions got more done than others lmao
it averages out to more damage over time, but 50% feels very bad sajj
yeah exactly, plus you can just get a streak of unlucky hits
If that happens you just won’t care though
I did not turn that pan lmfao
I'm jealous, I probably would've used that hair
I'm not looking for opportunities to make this jokes, they just come to me NiceSoftlock
This fight will determine what’s better
okay now you get one shot
DRAT I MISSED THE MASTERPIECE FOR 2 HRS
GOT STUCK IN THE RAIN AND HAD TO TAKE REIGNS FROM MY FRIENDS BUSINESS
no you can do it KEKW
if there's another exit I never found it
I mean you can always respec LUL
the makeup man is so kool and gruesome
he's voiced by andy serkis btw
I wanna make a little esquie doll when I'm sitting around without a job
The arms on this guy is beyond epic
it is the strongest Ice attack ever after all
I've skipped all of these fuckers
time to figure out sciel I guess lmao
oof, was kinda doing it too
chat, is it wack that I buy edibles based off the flavor ?
whomever this is, they're doing a great impression of Big the Cat
heading out thx again for this epicness
too angry / annoyed to be scared about dying. I fuck with it.
WHY'S THIS THING CHEEK'D THE FUCK *UP* !?!?
some pictos can be found at different levels in different places, so you may have missed the first one
I was not joking when I said that earlier NiceSoftlock
well you got me when you said it lmao
technically you can have just one person in your party whenever you want too lol
last I checked (might have changed) they do it for the speedrun LUL
yeah I haven't checked in over a week, but you can skip all of gestral village lmfao
though at the time they thought it might be slower
legendary? his feet don’t look orange
wait now I’m curious, did the hands guy kick you?
and now you're starting to see why the speedrun might do solo lmfao
again, no idea how routing's changed in the last week, but they were a week ago
wow those some damn good badges
oh dang, it's 2am, I gotta sleep. I hope you see the beach today
I mean get that luck to an A and it's better than might, soooooo
I seen that and thought you were watching twilight I’m cooked KEKW
I just picked a spot on the edge and waited for it to spin around lol
since the camera follows behind you
the number of times you walked right off the log monkaW
I see the feet are not bare like Aline’s phanto274Notes
she's 16 so that's probably a good thing NiceSoftlock
you can stand closer to the edge
like there's no momentum, just either a running jump or not
may or may not need a frame between, but otherwise yeah
you get it no matter what KEKW
or alternatively, don't git good 4Head
Is it possible for a video game quote on quote to lace or spike u.
yeah I think this was where I first noticed that
oh hey you found my AP engine
I never thought id type this but these last 2 streams has surpassed ur pape and battlenetwork pb streams.
Do you mine diamonds in there
Oh yeah lets get t it
They even have braille on them too look ❌
Let Phantom5800 know you want to drop in and collaborate!
Let Phantom5800 know you want to drop in and collaborate!
@JCog how did u know the kirby burger is my fave emote. I also have the mini figure of it as well.
Jordan you're welcome to come Papa John's Pizza I'm about to stick it in the fridge
anyway hope your day has been good hi
oh ty! might if there's still some tomorrow
it tells me you're relatable NiceSoftlock
doing something in the day HUH
so did the sound work first try today?
Let the power flow through us
love the idea of using a recoat to reallocate 6 points to luck lmfao
Good evening bruv wanna get some pints at me pub? < French btw
@SwiftPichu_ this game is so glorious did u get it yet?
you know i like both and i think you got the better option
i don't really care about ice cream that much anymore but i can go for a Wendy or dq ice cream anytime
@stavros12c34anenoglou don't care for it when I have metaphor in the backlog
And I also just can't take my feelings aside that this is an adult's paper Mario KEKW
haro, how did the sound go this time?
I don't wanna bother with the next boss in my playthrough so I'm just doing optional things
ok wait the battles look cool as hell
i think now i see why people are playing this
so are these all the same guy with time travel stuff or is it just UE5 character models
he had a skill tree BibleThump
I wish esquie was real so I could hug him too
you wanna see the whole tree? ng+ Kappa (for legal reasons, I actually have no idea how and if the tree unlocks, this is not a spoiler but a joke)
@JCog good news they making a esquie plushie
@blacktiger51 they said they'd look into it, not a guarantee
aaaand, not all women anymore lol
I skilled verso heavily into base attacks, he's a skill point printer now LUL
the whole time i was playing act 1 i was like why is  gustave skill tree smaller then everyone else
they completely faked me out with it, I was just waiting for some story event to unlock more lmao
@blacktiger51 it was mostly blocked so I expected something like a critical event unlocking them but well
you see i was thinking that but maelle and lune just have more unlock at the start
luckily they basically give all gustav's upgrades to verso so it doesn't feel like you wasted any resources on him
I couldn't bring myself to ever change anyone from the default
I think it's referring to Gustave lmao
sound track is so good in this game
iirc it usually autosaves every time you get off esquie too
thats an epic name for a portal place
people can overcap the max amount needed
you can also farm them later
yeah they're not actually a finite resource, at least later
I ended up just picking 3 party members and ignoring anyone else lol
there's basically nothing in the game that could become a regret later. well maybe just the feet
oh and something else I don't think they explain, everyone alive in your party gets full xp, anyone dead or in reserve gets 50%
just got done cleaning up my bookmarks, deleted like 1/3 of them that were just clutter from up to over a decade ago phanto274BLANKIES
yeah there were definitely some of those too lol
a bunch of random tools I never used that didn't even exist anymore
you know I didn't actually realize those crystals worked like that
when man meets machine and metal
this is the german VA I mentioned
with the weird french accent but also german accent
I mean that's what I did lmao
though I did it before gustave died KEKW
oh and you can control what order your party members line up in by what order they get added to the party
so you could add and remove them to reorder if you want
only matters on first strikes, otherwise it's based on speed
omg I just had a weird situation
enemy died during a combo because of my counters and poofed but the combo continued and killed sciel
oh no, were you inverted or something KEKW
oh I misread, but still lmfao
counters could maybe make the difference?
I mean you were getting them earlier
yeah it shows the text "First Strike" at the start of battle when you get it
and I was watching for it cause I wasn't sure if you got it earlier, and it showed up
I did this in post game and finished before I realized the walls could close in KEKW
Yo Phantom what broken abilities and pictos have I missed so far today
first thing I hear: 60% crit rate lmao
phantom was flattened a lot lol
oh no big boss? or was something else afoot
the platforming is like, my only substantive complaint with this game lol
yeah the rolls are dumb lmfao
I will warn you that you haven't found the hardest platforming challenge yet :)
yeah you've done all you can rn
I mean if there's more it's really well hidden lmao
this minigame is a crime against nature
damn he sunk tour battle ship
yeah was about to say, I found running helpful
yeah sometimes you have to just let one go to get caught up on the cooldown lmao
the lighting ain’t doing anyone a favour
okay I think there's a bug on that specific dialog if you go too fast?? cause that happened to me multiple times
can you only do this with one character? I have no idea if they’ve attack speeds are similar
it would help if the attack didn't have such a narrow hitbox too lmao
I basically stared at him the whole time and just did the actual aiming with my peripherals NiceSoftlock
ngl i rage quit that and never went back YEP
if it makes you feel any better, imo that's the worst one
yeah are you sure about that
if the one you mean is the one I'm thinking of, then yes, but it's not the only bad one NiceSoftlock
I always want to spend time with esquie
sure was a mortal hit alright
the other one hadn't even finished fading away lmao
ngl I also got lost here for a bit
never go beat a final boss of an arc and expect the story to not take over an hour after than OMEGALUL 2:40am
at least I don't need to wake up for work now YEP
okay, gnight gnight, praise the feet
hey! what a game this is
time to recoat someone and not assign any skill points!
oh yeah I'm aware, remarking on its excellence
i like show she slides on one foot lol
yeah really puts the stakes into perspective
might be nice to have a cap, i dont think i would ever want to be like 50 years old
I don’t know you might be able to burn that guy if you really try Kappa
Darn friend meeting interrupted this but yes in time for lvl 25 juggernaughts
bruh he gets like 10 attacks in one turn
and the funny number, to boot
and the shit just keeps getting more broken!
i got a hatsune miku pedal for my guitar today
it makes it sound like kk from animal crossing
so i can recreate animal crossing songs LUL
i also never thought of kk's voice as a vocaloid until now, it definitely sounds like one
oooooh inverted affinity was one of my favorites
u def gotta clip the cutscenes for a movie stream phantom
oh shit just in time for one of the best bosses
I often found I was about as likely to need to revive as heal, so I was always happy to take the +50% attack in exchange
now he has as many swords as 2-chainz has chainz
i like that you tried to dodge the second hit of that attack the first time, then they trained you to think there WASNT a second hit... then slap
idk why this boss gets a sick cinematic kill but im here for it
There were a bunch. Everyone in that lil party after the gommage was on your expedition
They don't do a great job of showing all that.
I feel like the older expeditions would have had more people because 1) more eligible people alive and 2) less-established reputation of certain death so more volunteers
I think only the people in expeditioner outfits are expeditioners, but it's not clearly stated
The overwhelming urge to equip 200 pictos
The best character in the story and game
Best character? Idk second best maybe
That big sac of love and friendship over there though? That's number 1
Esquie is top tier character design
Do you want to spend time with Esquie? Insulting question tbh
i wonder what hugging and sleeping with esquie would feel like
Maelle uses him like a pillow a lot, so I imagine it's pretty nice
so now we have an ally
I felt the same way lol, game doesn't tell you a thing about them
But it's a lot of exposition so worth
that sky is such so beautiful
can confirm practicing music is like this
remember what I said about the edible + melatonin gummy combo? guess what I'm doing tonight
this music's oddly appropriate for that log you just played
edible + melatonin gummy = the Esquie special
you, uh, may want to look at how much his hp bar moved
Do you want to know about a permanently missable thing? It's the only permanently missable thing I know of in the game
It's not really a spoiler or anything, just something the game doesn't tell you that stops achievements if you care about that
how many bounces could the bouncer really bounce? the world may never know
Why he does a goofy lil belly flop idk, but I like it
"Oh, a lost gestral." Yup, that's how I found all of them. Except one, which was obvious to me
Or whatever the fuck this is
Do not speak of Esquie in such a manner
oh yeah, I heard ACE is on there lmfao
dunno if I knew that tbh
HUH you can get ultra hammer without laki parakarry and Sushie
oh yeah wait I guess that makes sense, I was thinking you couldn't get below it on the middle level
i didn't know that was a thing
@blacktiger51 wait how do you cross the lava?
you could do it in rando with phantom sushie
it just means in that room
i didn't know you could get oob in the ultra hammer room
yeah you walk to the top of the far left by the lava
and then jump around the wall
and is absurdly hard for that timesave
i could probably get like half of the achievements Deadge
I mean I think a good few have done it
guessing you have to use a jp rom for some of them
I wonder how it checks for shovel jump, like will it accept a laki jump up there?
like that's what it says, but maybe it just checks that you get up there from not the door lol
don't mind me, just trying to find glitches for the glitches
story progress will have it up
you can grab it for RAC by clippin into the stairs
time to bring up the old r0b video
they worked on that one together either way
i could maybe do the clip version and its a big maybe KEKW
I'd have to relearn that one
so do an any% run lmfao
oh I was reading Whirwind Tour
so get to a high level before fighting final NOTED
now the actual challenge: route a speedrun of 100%ing this
you could have multiple branch points
NOTED never talk to that bot (i don't even play fortnite anymore)
oh watched the any% WR for this today.
you've made it to about the 50 min mark so far I think lmao
also there are a lot more skips than I last checked LUL
i seen some skips i haven't watch the run yet
pretty much all the skips are like, here's some poorly placed collision, now get oob NiceSoftlock
speaking of oob i load my save and i was oob on the world map and i was stuck went into full panic mode thinking i had to restart the game
btw that's weird but for some reason the game sound is mono for me now
oh yeah it is for me too
i only hear it in my left ear i have a headset on
yeah I'm using speakers so I didn't notice at first
at least you can skip the whole cutscene
i never had any issue with my ps5 playing this game
would it do it for something else plugged into the the capture card?
could just be the game you never had issue with zzz when you stream that
PS5 why you take this from us phanto274Cry
you want the name of it
now remember the 1 in 7 people like feet?
he's my fav to use KEKW
i never like blue mages in games but i like this 1
why did twitch not start playing the stream for me again until I refreshed phanto274Rage
is it just the longest one every time lmao
I didn't realize you could do it with more than one person
verso I know a way you can fix that PAUSERS
I've been doing side stuff for 4h today and everything is still DANGER
and I'm way worse than you at the game so it's a struggle against chromatics LUL
oh you found the one :)
hope you like last year's streamer hit!!
or at least I think that was last year
I didn't think this one was toooooo bad
a good song until you hear it for over a hour Clueless
no individual part is that bad, it's just very punishing
Clair Obscur: Don’t Fuck Up was the working title before they changed it to Expedition 33
I was 100% expecting you to roll off the edge on the jump to the stairs
yeah that pillar got me too lol
I like to imagine the devs were just laughing uncontrollably when they realized they could put this in their game and decided to actually do it
that pillar got me 3 times
I managed this course on the 2nd try but volleyball killed me
if nothing else, this will have you fully prepared for any other platforming the game throws at you
i almost got it 1st try and failed but got Madge and try to speed run to the top and its took me like a hour
let just say i got really really good at the 1st half smilers
I think I fell a good few times at the start, but only fell from really high up once or twice
that is, only fell the whole way down once or twice lmao
omg I didn't realize that was an accordion
where's the onlyup% speedrun of e33
This should be a category extension
I'll be shocked if it's not
when you think you almost done and you look up and.. you see so much more YEP
knowing what I know now about the story these beaches seem even more stupid now considering some facts about the story lul
look we don't know how geology works here
btw you can talk to them all
its was cuz its req for the platinum  smilers
you definitely have the worst two out of the way now
what's the other bad one? volleyball?
it was waving in the wind and just stopped
you see for the volley ball 1 you only need to beat the easy 1 and its count
yes i never beat the hard 1
I mean not that that would've stopped me
gotta get the swimsuit and never wear it 4Head
I think you just have maelle and lune's hairstyles reversed lmao
we at the pony club it's just not pink
game sadly isn't woke enough SadgeCry
you used the other one already
doing camp events rn and one scene everyone is fine and next scene suddenly everypne is bloody and close to death LOL
this is so confusing with sciel having a ponytail lmao
like lune is fine cause black hair, but not sciel LUL
I beat it but I still don't understand it
I kinda just shot randomly until I was at the end here NiceSoftlock
Trooper pulled over a guy speeding. Sir, why were you speeding? I am a magician and juggler and I have a show to get to. Oh? Can you juggle something for me? I would love to but all my equipment is at the venue. Trooper says, I have some flares in the trunk, can you juggle those? Certainly!! The trooper ignites the flares and the man starts juggling. A drunk man approaches and gets in the troopers car. When asked what he was doing he said there is no way I can pass that sobriety test. Cheer100
ngl I was expecting a Pagliacci the clown joke
pretty sure you got it all
can't believe Maelle lived that lmao
oh my god I hadn't seen the stats on her in a while KEKW
I feel like they could've sold the visuals on how that separated them a bit better tbh
you're gonna use monoco and you're gonna like it BabyRage
I actually do kinda wonder if that was the gameplay reason here, to make sure you tried out every character
That's not very giggity of Monoco
do we need a feet emote
must've just expected you to always have all three in your party
cause I doubt going solo monoco is a very common strat here
yeah I mained him along with maelle and lune
If you can put up with the feet he's useable
though that was partially because I wanted to make sure I got all the feet FEET
but I also liked using him so it was fine
oh yeah, can't do solo strats now
could run solo - 3 - solo lmao
I mean that's an option KEKW
Verso has no ponytail therefore he’s not allowed to fight
wait is that supposed to be possible
the French are very cheery folk
JCog how could you, think of Phantom’s strats phanto274Cry
I'm just making it a limited time experience, thus heightening the value of this stream
report the bug, stop the verso disrespect
so like, what happens if you die now
it’s not behaving like the previous part
should have built him up monkaS
well at least he didn't vanish verso lol
I was wondering if they would do that monkaS
interesting that it said Failed instead of the normal dying text
I wonder if that's related somehow to how they gave you your party back internally
or maybe because renoir wouldn't kill them all but make them fail the mission
maelle was still there to revive btw
The life preserver really adds to this scene
again, esquie is just the best
Coral ain't under distress here catSmash
this island has an incredible fight theme but it's just trauma for me now
btw there's a shopkeeper in the gestral village that gives you a ton of lumina in return for you collecting journals at certain milestones
massive house clean up is over at last
also due to it being the 6 month anniversary i was given my dads jewelry i never put monetary value on his life but its weird having them
ofc they have andros easter egg
the battle music so top tier
This must just be a super high level enemy this is nuts
and then of course you parry the mortal one and it doesn't matter
God i cant love the developpers enough for this.
Oh shit you killed it monadoLFS
screwed around and got some pape achievements phanto274Sip
also there's an LZS leaderboard and my god does LZS suck on emu
I got 32 then got bored NiceSoftlock
you don't have to move the analog stick at least
i only play pape on emu and some tricks are ass YEP
oh the piano is different depending on who's playing btw
Wanna ask you about a pape rando redeem idea I had
its the 7 chapter preset, with light traps...
but everytime you get a trap you HAVE to homeward shroom LUL
oh no that’s horrendous Axl KEKW
see, everyone is on board here
i was waiting for axl to come tell you it KEKW
you picked the wrong place to stand, buddy
amish, I already got levias and luey on board if you wanna join us
a for fun race yeah, I was imagining everyone in the same VC room too
oh man, that sounds interesting but I’ve got a busy weekend. why don’t you let me know the details on disc and I can let you know
for sure, we havent picked a day yet
you have no idea how ready to counterattack he is
think you need more luck on lune Kappa
yeah she’s not 100% crit rate yet so it’s not enough
do you already have the burn on shot picto?
yeah I use that on everyone and it hits enough
especially since the characters become sp printers late
I get you're shrimping, I just found sciel to be way better at supporting and dps
yeah i kicked lune from my party
why'd that mask look like biden
would have to go back in the vod lmao
Phantom I did a dumb today
Monoco really just went 🤨 to all that
i was thinking i just got a trophy KEKW
I'm sure that was meant to be taken literally and had no second meaning
think of all the enemies we could have dropped a piano on
Anime Central, big convention in Illinois
A staff member ran up to me and just told me to play Chrono Trigger yesterday
anyway I'm going back rn for day 2 so lurking
oh my god she does just fly with her feet facing the camera
there better be a mod to give her SHOES
also i am lurking! have fun w game
i know nothing about shab except that they clown on shab and that he seems like he deserves it
if it looks like the inside of jabu and you're playing feet lady i think its where the devs intend you to go
sucks doom is mid but stellar blade pc has a release date now
nier-like game made by koreans with the chick with the fat ass
ps5 game from i think 2023? getting pc port
oh it's the sexy woman meme vs dark souls with ladders
only thing i know about it is the girl with the fat ass YEP
i mean, girl with fat ass and "has fast, fluid combat" are like the only things i know about the game
monadoShrug faster than DMC 5 is fine with me
hey no pissing on the plants
I would like to play it myself, but my own rule forbids me to buy any games now Kappa
but I put it on my steam wish list, so maybe at some point I will get it
to reduce my backlog, I told myself to only buy one new game for every two I finish
I am at -1 rn, because I kinda softened it for the Switch 2
but I plan to get this game at some point, early next year I will have more time to play too
i wasn't gonna get this game but its kept blowing up my feed everyone was playing it
well it looks and sounds amazing, and the battles look great and with some fresh mechanics
and suddenly a McD ad LUL
well I don't understand at all how the battle system works
at least I'd like to think a get a grasp on a couple of things
is there a way to remove the damage cap?
do the girls look so bloody because they are damaged so hard?
which makes me think, is there no item or skill to recover the party HP?
okay, but that skill sure has some benefit to it
so the party not active in the fight doesn't get exp from fights?
glad they removed that in Xenoblade X, made me use the other party members a lot more
what was that damage jeez LUL
seeing more of this really makes me wanna play it now. I guess I have to hurry up finishing games and get it for my summer break
so that's how she did so much fricking damage
I guess this game will be really the next on the list
just parry everything perfectly, eady LUL
but it really looks more like endgame stuff
how many hours are you in now?
darn it, I can't walk over rock at the height of my kneecaps
that is a rpg trait I don't like
I think I saw that happen the other time too, but that streamer was still in the beginning I guess
that really seems like a weird mechanic
I would have thought that things cast like magic would still hit
or maybe there is a skill that can bypass it?
are there other ways to cause damage over time like the burn?
you got to love them YEP
I hope flying enemies aren't a common thing
yeah, I'm doing endgame completion stuff rn, there's a lot
it's nice that the game isn't padded to death
the only overly padded game where I enjoy the padding a ton is tales of the abyss
@langepon Yo i love tales of the abyss
I did that with health and agility on verso with a hard scaling sword, dude is a mosnter
dang, I think he's 2nd strongest after maelle
I don't do the low hp style but the high perfection style
verso is good but he need to be in s rank
A rank already is stronk and some sword push him to A on 2nd round
uhm yeah, your verso is bad lol
you want to make me mad? Madge
like I said, building into fast perfection and not into low hp
because your build sucks rn, that's all
I think the difference is more visible when they unlock the damage cap
so like, all in all good progress
i was playing botw if that helps
i know nothing about this game, i have been off twitch for a week so ive missed everyone playing it lmao
but i gotta raid and run im HONGY
well, I gotta go to bed
there's midboss type enemy coming up in this dungeon that is the first possibility of farming lumina
they could have gone further, yeah
did you not get the skill?
wanna know where to get it?
the picto in there kinda sucks so it's not that horrible to miss it
you get the skill to break these things if you collect 4 mini gestrals
and yeah they usually hide pictos and skins
there's a trick to this one
can you actually break a petank to stop it from running, I wonder...
no idea for real, just thinking
i went down there look at the enemies and said nope and went back up
i have no audio. woman are incredible gl on stream :D
did you just fly up to a small ledge then have to land to jump over it
that's a lie i'm judging quite a bit
are you sure you looks a little low on crit rate Kappa
so if you want something that rounds to 97%, sure
this place has the 5 lumina dropping enemy. you'll hate it LUL
ok gnight, don't get too angry at the clairs and obscures and claire obscures and all ;)
i do really like this how the game talk about the pass expeditions
yeah i really like how the game does that
Yo, Phantom. Popular RPG go brrr.
YEP i had the same issue here phase 1 EZ phase 2 took me a few trys
i think touch pad open menu on your turn and you can reload a save
my goodness the feel of this game never gets stale
ok where the fuck did you get that flag from
x to pause if you need to use the bathroom
I was gonna go take a nap anyway lol
already added expedition 33 songs to the playlist i see
i turn my pc on today and its updated and window reset my sound settings to default got to love Microsoft YEP
if you decide to do more story rn and not more completion, I may need to leave to avoid spoilers LUL
you beat the monolith stuff yesterday, right?
btw did you farm the clair obscure for lumina or no?
are you planning to do post game stuff on stream?
I beat it up like 6 times but there's a better farming location later on in what I assume will be the final dungeon
yeah I wanna do the optional stuff before the final boss as well
since it's cooler to be done and then let the credits roll
but then there's the game that troll players with their credits like Dragon Quest 11
I find it cool how they probably used their concept and mood arts here
it's at least the arc de triomphe... prolly
oh I'm here at a good time
they definitely know how to make an impact at the end of an act lol
yeah that's pretty much what I did KEKW
i kept her with white heir cuz i only had the default
howdy hey happy sunday, dropping a lurk!
imagine the strongest being in the world gets mad. oopsie
"thanks I stole it from Lune"
imagine doing all these location changes in engine lol
other games would have made us retrack this manually lol
now I wonder if the human bridge is still in that one level
no, it was an optional stage
also - where the heck is gustave then
btw, just a recommendation - do Esquie's character quests girst
yeah for the record, post game has just, so much content, and you're nowhere near powerful enough for a lot of it
yeah this location is fine to do now
yeah the danger thing is pretty accurate imo
we just don't know exactly when lul
though I do wish the map was a bit more informative about that stuff
i mean i could tell you but that not fun
for example there's also this one stupid fleeing ball enemy that wants your team to be close to level 80 NotLikeThis
yeah I had a really good time with post game for the most part
also you can finish character relationships now - the stages they require are appropriate to level up rn too
@JCog post game as in rn or AFTER the final boss?
but yeah basically everything other than lumiere rn is postgame
you can just do it whenever story-wise
@JCog okay so basically only go into lumiere to farm
oh btw I saw the combo you were talking about
basically what I did but way easier to setup lol
I was building toward the same lune move
the combo i did was way to op
I didn't realize that one that fills her stains was the same elements every time
I had a few different ways I'd fill it, but it always relied on rng at least a bit
paperLurk all I heard (hewwo, lurky) was 95 and my brain was like "time to let the game xcom the player"
I am currently heavily keepin fingers crossed for upcomin thursday
got a job interview then and if I get it, mighty happy for vaious reasons PrideUwu
yeah I got lost here a lot lol
more like a 22% tbh though
might even be able to changer her pictos to something with more crit, if you haven't already
YEP time to get the 1% in a critical moment PrideLaugh
101% crit chance surely can not miss anymore KEKW
it BETTER give chance to triple crit now KEKW
why else would it show above 100% as an option
ok I saw a 47.5k in there PrideLaugh
how the fuck did breaking the cap give you a casual 400% extra damage on that move 🤣
oo, took 3 hits that time
yep this one hurt at first
yeah these attacks took me a hot sec to get down
right after that sword swoosh sound like 0.2s at most after?
count with them doing the sword charging sound
the only attack outside of the rhythm is the last one, being minimally slower
is it visually always when the swinging hand of them goes past their shoulder stance-wise?
I mean yea - just curiosity more then anything given guessing over the internet where the browser and such can also play tricks on me PrideFlower
I'm serious when I'm saying that I counted out loud for this boss
can't say I ever had any issues on pc
i never had issues but i only play ps5 so think i might just be use too it
I also only played it on ps5 and I'm really worse than you at these games
overworld first strikes override it I think
wens retro achievements on console, emu angles suck lol
@JCog pape or which game? PrideLaugh
yeah for pape, the new glitch showcase subset
@JCog ahh that makes lots of sense then PrideLaugh
oh I was on this fight for a while lol
though I hadn't started using that lune move yet though
there a trophy for doing all floors
dolly please go to the left butter15Yeshoney
I've looked at the code, I know it's a 50/50 chance, but I still don't believe it
update, you can cheese the kooper skip achievement with sushie glitch KEKW
i beat those guys around lvl 55 just don't ask how long its took me
i had to learn the parry timing for them
well you see my damage back then wasn't no where close to your lune damage KEKW
think i farm here until level 83 ish
i wanted levels my team was a little different
i did beat the game before i farm for levels
85 to 99 took me 30 mins YEP
i was just watching youtube the whole time
fwiw I'm at lvl... 93? after doing most of the content and I never grinded once
though I do also have at least one weapon for everyone at max level NiceSoftlock
im not gonna tell you where but i was also farming lumnia points at the same time
that weapon was how I generated stains
get two random ones, then another two from a regular move
as long as I didn't get two of the same to start I could make it work
idk what on my lune since i didn't use her
you didn't get a chance to see it, but his attack just does more and more bounces every time he does it
I had him doing well over like 20 lmao
gotta come back for that xp lol
I am completely gassed out from back to back shows
to think if it wasn't for gustave you wouldn't be this op
yeah but he made the  lumina converter
think you might need to fight him Kappa
im just happy this game is not open world until the end YEP
someone beat her at level 37 since you can fight her as soon as you meet her
Darn this is gonna be nutty
i like how she just go super saiyan
this reminds me of the rose queen ninja in Elden ring
yeah do you want to know?
use maelle she drop something good for her
Got this moment on the big screen yes!
And if chat double loads on me one more time im done with this website
that weapon was bugged its use to plus 50% all damage but its been patched
just hit act 2 last night
anyway, leaving now so I don't get super spoiled
i have a feeling i know what you gonna go get YEP
ok you are not getting what i think u was
what i was thinking was is not here all im gonna say
hmm i never fought this thing
you see in here its different for some reason
KEKW not gonna add it but there a lune feet emote
had to download the new version
with minish it any settings  just no timed ko ye
minish Rando sent iin dm i think i did correct :P WOo finaly 50k
when ur stream scedual at momento
a monday works best for me cause hospital
IM gonna try do seed myself to see how hard i made it lel
I was streaming Shrek any% I have 3 more levels to learn KEKW
i find its really funny how they found the music composer off SoundCloud
and the  lead writer off  reddit KEKW
and we got a game that better then 90% of triple A games YEP
this rn just me or is the game audio mono?
dunno if its surround or stereo, but its on both ears and full audio
also fuck gravity and cables, feeling that
gonna guess the cables are heavy and short at the same time which causes it?
This doesn't look like the game "End". This just looks like the end of your game Smh
haro haro, just stopping by for a moment to say hi. I need to do some work because humans require sustenance and a roof
PrideUwu finally being able to take my victory lap on KH1 for completing it proper is hilarious - I forget how much you feel superbly overpowered in that game when you are at max level with good equip 🤣
"Reviving an ally causes him to instantly fully heal himself skipping the turn queue, second chance also affects this" - fextra
The PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt was preminent today and u choose to go on early
The bike ride was a decompressor.
So Phantom, are you ready for today's round of "Phantom reacts to Zeli talks about projects that Phantom doesn't care about?" Kappa
So what is this game? I don't think I've seen it and slightly struggling to understand
you routing out strats or just minmaxing? 🤔
ok PrideFlower just was askin cus I heard ya mention those damage numbers and such
also my brain is currently in Kingdom hearts mode where bosses got desperation moves all the time for when ya do enough damage or overextend your combos past certain counts and such
just throwing this out there will you like to know where something is that will help you?
do you want to know if there harder stuff?
do you want to know if you can go there?
smilers this is the help i was talking about
btw you can get cheater at the start of act 2 but its not easy
its a long fight if you do
you don't actually have to leave camp if you wanna do all of them
i was thinking you have to leave camp and come back but you don't
guess i can add to it now you don't have to leave camp until you get a side quest from all of them
he have surf fly and now dive YEP
actually the gacha is going to be the final boss for this game isn’t it
"playlist order: shuffle" ... sure it is
this song deserves to have the Gandalf nod
shuffle set to only e33 songs YEP
this is my nap time but I hope u have good luck
fancy seeing you round these parts
have you heard about the sequel?
finishing the game is locked behind finishing the game
i have a feeling its no logic but its beatable
there was HELLA cheesecake on display at ComboBreaker
oh I thought someone told me it was abandon
Just went to commercial but hi! How's the rando going?
Nice, minish rando. I've also been on a minish rando kick the last couple weeks.
My brother's in town, so I can't stick around. GL, HF. x461weNut
Put ezlo on my ass so I can feel something
i woke up 2 hours early to run an archi LUL
How the cow treating u lel
blacktiger, dk64 castle lanky dungeon to my banjo flight pad for grunty industries roof top for DK64 bongos lmao
we got each other go mode
phanom, ill say banjo is long for a solo rando but for sync archi i tendo to run 6 boss + final boss in around 4 hours
sometimes 3 hours if im lucky
picked up 2 games today, captain toad and epic mickey. im enjoying getting 2 games for 80 bucks
I wasn't gonna do cow  but I glad I did
last minish cap YouTube upload was 4 months ago
I hope this is hard enough lel  I tried to make it good
Open seeds = fun and more RANDOM which is the point ye?
@darkapplequeen Phantom knows what to expect, they set the reward
I think non element can have items
I don't fully remember what I put
Soo does that mean non element are in logoc
I passed the fuck out after Combo Breaker weekend
tune in next week where I'll sit outside a Best Buy for 2 hours
My siblings really want to do midnight launch for Switch 2
I got hit by like everything in this seed
I lost. he beat me by like 15 minutes again
Yeah I think I lost a lot of time just not optimizing fights
I've never played this game but it's on my list. I've heard it's fun
possibly the best @D / top-down Zelda
Good day, Phantom! Good luck on your... cow escort?
2 hour into my seed how it goin

Nap took over vaatis fall oh wellz
phanto274Lurk sleep time gonna leave u open tho
just popped an edible I got from a friend at ComboBreaker
said friend causally popped an edible before they hopped into their car to drive home
was you actually asking about the 1  Picto? or was just speaking aloud
this shit's kickin in with a vengeance
if you just want lumina points the old lumiere boss you fought before drop 5
if you want levels and points you not there yet
in my experience, alcohol shuts up the voices
guess you could go to the level up area you can get there now
do you want to know if its a dive area?
I like where this is going
yeah i went with sciel and you can guess what happened YEP
doesn't help that you can do post game before you even beat the game YEP
i been meaning to ask did you ever finish metaphor?
the 1st 2 area is just boring Deadge
i do want to go back and platinum metaphor but just too lazy to do the 1st 2 area again
the 3rd area does get good
its does take a little long to get party members
i had to step away for a sec miss everything you said
just a head up you have to pick the right choice here or u get locked out
yeah if you lie you get locked out and no trophy
phantom, pippy wants to know if you *are* a gender, i assume there is context but frankly i'm confused by it enough i don't understand it
(context is the question, is a phantom a gender, so you came up)
its ok she go easy you on
there are 2 more  gestral games
1st 1 you did was parkour
maybe i miss you doing it
think you miss 1 and i know for sure you didn't do the last 1
idk i only fought 2 things here
you dont need it to beat this area
he only give 2 now HUH
he was dropping 5 for me
i farm him from 85 to 99 in 30 mins
i had more then enough when i hit 99 so i stop
my maelle had like 400 points
you can probably guess what this is
this fight is hit every parry or gg smilers
Yes dinner and car show was great and made it for nightmare/seigfried
i love how this game has it all. did u find the street fighter tekken references
i mean this is the superboss
someone beat him without using parry or dodge and the devs was like HUH its possible
id rather deal with sephiroth in kingdom hearts
i 1 shot him so i didn't know that was a thing for a while
i heard it take people 3 hours to beat it legit
were def going off story and beaten path
i did this area around level 70 and YEP
i did a new game plus run since i miss a missable after being told there no missable Madge
there a key in the prologue then unlock a journal
thats ok, I just finished bioshock and am very tired
does the bot shoutout when people raid HUH that was fast af
yeah i was like 3/4 way through and then got stuck in the market/final fight for like 2 hours, then started the dlc, but figured 6 hours was enough i was v tired lmao
I've been wanting to play this game but i havent had the patience to download it lmao
the 1 shot is easy to set up if you just wanna beat him
solo maelle  and use stendhal with all the damage stuff on
and it been nerf and its still broken af
yeah i ned to download this on my xbox so i can pl,ay it, but itll take like a whole ass day to download ll 50+gbs of it
i don't count trails games for goty since those come out in jp already so this is my goty
the new mafia game looks good
trails in the sky remake does come out this year worldwide so i could count that
love to hear it, i imagine she's reluctantly the foot lady
her feet are out there with the best foot forward
guess i could tell you now since you done with post game roulette is actually very good in act 3
renoir wasn't lying maelle is gonna die in there Sadge
YEP another ending if you pick verso
i just watch the other ending on youtube
phanto274GG silent1053GG pripcyGG crysta225Gg second55GG uksgmaGG
the name of the game does spoil if you know the meaning of  clair obscur
It was ur best stream choic ever but too bad i was in nap mode being the holiday
Clair-obscur" is a French term that translates to "light-dark". In the context of art, it refers to a technique that uses strong contrasts between light and dark to create a sense of volume and depth, often seen in paintings.
combat is a 10 out of 10
i think i did skip now that u said something
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
he left behind the  lumina converter for those who come after
ty for verifying tts works lol
so issue i cant join the sub vc
Welp, hope I didn't choose too short settings with blitz Pape
I’m glad I’m not the only one that hasn’t brushed their hair.
Oh somehow I have more checks than Phantom, guess I'm probably fine
It's supposed to be LCL with closed everything, gearless start, overworld coins, all blocks, and panels
I thought it did but IDK
I’m going to be cleaning so I’ll be listening.
Guess you didn't make room for other POVs unless you set it up while BK's
Oh you don't have the AP client on this layout
I wish I had time to do more of these... but I'm glad I could join today!
Mr Phantom the door is really old
So I got my new bike lights yesterday :)
They seem nice. I need to remount my radar unit because of where I should put these lights but that's okay
I fear whoever rolled might not have had the latest PM64 APWorld...
where do you get the tracker for this? Looks like a lot of fun!
Yeah, it was rolled on an old APWorld so I only have to do 4 Spirits but it's not LCL
very good. thanks. I'll check it out
Man, I have to pay Kent too Smadge
Oh, wait, this means I also won't have panel hints, that's the only reason I turned panels on in the first place :(
At least I have Super Boots now so it's fine
I'm about to do something weird and save scum a Fright Jar
Is that in one of the drawers?
It's turning in the Gold Ring
I'm not BK, just hinted some things that would expedite go mode
You have everything to get to Boat Curse, right?
Sorry, should've gotten you that cola earlier but jumped on a Spike Goomba at 1HP lol
just got done installing a new cpu for gortho, i forgot how much i hate working inside of a pc case lol
went from r3 3200g to a r5 5600 so her pc is juiced for rn considering all she does is oot KEKW
Your camera is out of focus
I'm 1 item away from ch8 access so figured I'd hint that preemptively :3
I can go get your Power Bounce while I wait
ooo GL with the TTYD AP
Ride me like you ride yoshi
How you feeling about current version of TTYDAP?
did you reorganize the broadcast view?
yooo ttyd rando is real and out??? grimmp4Pog
ahh true thats always a slog
the other archi has 25 yamls and people have already pilled into VC lmao
is there any news of the devs improving some of that stuff? like removing some of the quests or is that not really possible?
i hate emerald does that for the abandoned ship for the various keys
If you use MarioWiki + the tracker, you can figure it out but I agree you shouldn't have to
I can't tell what it is though
I might actually? The one where you fall on a stump, below the stump is a bush
There's a bush in the room you just passed too
can you find a visual somewhere maybe?
I think it has to be the room with the stump or the room directly after that
How many Punis are for the pedestal in that room?
damn yall are still goin? I prolly coulda played 3 games if I didn't have to leave. Maybe next time lmao.
what the heck is a ap item?
alright we have a gen, so gonna dip out. Let me know when we do the next one
The timeloss in the non-speedrun NotLikeThis
I think the AP names should be specific
Even more so than the tracker
The advantage to vanilla item names is you can cross-reference vanilla guides
But having a guide in addition to the tracker shouldn't be mandatory
I think that might be the only rock in the room
If your goal was to fill a stream w/o landing in BK ever, TTYD is good at that :)
Especially if you're confident you can finish it in a sitting (I wouldn't be)
FFXII is also good for that, it's really hard to get BK'd especially with how I have the starting items set up just cause the game is so slow and like everything is in a different direction. It'd prolly take like 8 hours to full clear a seed lmao.
I mean, the sanctum also exists
More cutscenes and platforming after the boss
Probably not too much time though, yeah
There's also the intermission in the final boss
is this that clair obscure 33 game
there's definitely some obscuring going on.
The cutscenes are longer than the battle lol
TTYD is the real Snoy movie
this is where you find the based waluigi costume
Can you actually grab them from lower down like that?
I think it drops you the room before those fights
I don't think you get a break between the 3 fights in vanilla, do you?
They absolutely seethed at me because I called the "cross naughts"
i have 998.9k channel points getting close
When you get past phase 1 of Shadow Queen, get your clamp ready
They would never let us play as paper Kammy Koopa in Mario Kart World
this is my DANGER MARIO set up
charging coins for heals down here was diabolical
is this go mode, are we done, or do we need to get checks for them
Oh right there's TWO of these cutscenes...
I knew that, didn't remember there being one before too though
They'll never let us drive around as shadow queen peach in mario kart world
they would never let us drive gloomtail as a kart in mario kard world
that'd be funny if that was a goal option
If u never clicked become her servant u aren't a real gamer
missing out on the mario health from the poison mushrooms
time to hint for a life shroom Kappa
When I realized I wasn't on the correct patch, I made a point to toss items frequently
i tabbed to a different stream and now we're back at the same part of the fight
give mario your power to charge his genki dama ball
IDK actually but I think release is after the fight
Maybe just watch the client idk
oh yeah i bought sea of stars yesterday
it was on sale for 25 can so worth it
the audience members are me when the 2 minute ads end
mario 3 is a play btw
mario 2 is a dream btw
here comes another 20 minute cutscene
and now time for another 20 min of cutscenes :(
you could get 1 but its cheating
You cold straight up cheat engine the multiworld check too but we're live on Twitch
i never take my headset off
Probably should tiger...showering could damage them
I also wear headphones all the time but I also don't have long hai
We're going to resurrect mario so that we can raid the shadow queen at dreamhack
FF6 credits is legit a 30 min long unskippable cutscene but thankfully it's credits so you're already done with the game.
yep, especially when you only have 5
altho 150 ain't as bad as 50 million in FFXIi :p thankfully tho that boss is optional so I have its location excluded but it is a check if I want to be a psycho and have stuff there :D
I think that was a Ruin Powder
Father.... is it over? I see only darkness.... before.... me....
I think it may be at the end of this cutscene but before the epilogue
I mean, this game's the only one with a proper audience, right?
yeah I really hate the stage/audience mechanics
yeah I can imagine, 6:30 is a long sync lmao
SPM has a tiny bit of audience mechanics iirc but nothing on the level of TTYD
it's been a long time since I did one of these.
L I V , DAMN YOU
I am also here but probably not for long lol
sometimes a late night stream is really nice
@Phantom5800 Did you see the Multiversus social medias change their pfps to a gravestone with #deadgame graffitied on it?
might pop a shot and an eddie
they got backlash and removed the graffiti
so now it's just a gravestone
also, it's 9pm my time, so I don't trust how I feel about my life
oh yeah that game went eos
that's THE stupidest meme I've seen, but it's actual good advice
you are the pape-est champion for running these CBT seeds
is anyone else gonna tune into Geoff Keighley's summer muppet fest?
@SeventyFourTG if someone boots it up in VC, I'll hop in
You need I Spy for it to work
just need to endure 3 more days until I stand outside a Best Buy
I mean when you put them in affects flavor depending on the veggies so it makes sense.
@buff00n did you see the Akaneia Build stuff btw?
Ah yeah.  I love throwing some veggies under the roasting pan to cook in the drippings though.  Roasted onion and shallots in chicken fat for instance.
Since there is cooking discussion we made matcha waffles with a lime curd yesterday
i heard that as nacho waffles
I got it from the Sonic cookbook lol
Ooh!  That's great.  We had the same deal.  Was 2$ cheaper  since it was the entire pork instead of precut...we cut it and froze the chops and threw the loin into roast.
Loin is slightly tougher then the chops surrounding it but like...cook it right there is no difference.  Maybe use some honey or pineapple to tenderize
Nice.  The presear is interesting.  Will have to try that.
ACTINUP paper mario and 2 beers
you can't bombette the trees? that's interesting.
Just made a simple rice and eggs for myself
ik a couple in Toad Town have very poorly placed ones as well
I had a convention over the weekend so I just ordered wings.
@darkness3827 isn't the gambling one for instance on the other side of the room haha?
@Penguin_Cuddles Yeah the x coordinate for the bomb hitbox is missing the negative sign lmao
No the spicy kind.  It's basicly a gay beauty pageant
Was fun.  Got some new boots though so my feet are WRECKED.
That's why I was vague on purpose to keep it pg haha.
I know but still don't want to just be flopping things and info out.
do NOT watch this stream if you're a kid or else you will be DESTROYED
did you use the wolf link amiibo in this game
I did piss off a transphone so weekend was pretty good.
that's what you get for choosing violence
are there any letters that don't give any reward?
I think that's the most coins I've ever seen us have haha
i know you have mega smash
i miss the 1st 10 mins
Did you miss the button for the Fortress Key or was that actually your first?
Oh I guess I missed the explosion
I got recommended "getting a star in mario 64 every day until I get married"
someone played super mario 64 everyday up until their wedding
I think that's beautiful but also some bullshit because I got every star in that game and still don't have a wife
not doing a 120 star run per day? what a casual
i 100% that game like 10 times
So that's where your hammer went
him taking away your hammer should give you your hammer
i been playing sea of stars for like 4 hours and damn its good
I agree, isn't that what happens in an buffer overflow? Kappa
combat does feel like mario rpg
and i never played much mario rpg
or well moreso floating than flying
I did enjoy the remake they made a little bit ago.  Made rpg more accessible to play.
i played the snes 1 a long long time ago
and for like a few hours never beat it
i seen that game too many times to care to play it
Oh it's a great game but it does have its quirks since design choices for sure.  The remake fixed some
I didn't like how you can't swap mario out.  Like I get he's the main character in theory but I want to try different trios
only other jrpgs on my list now is octopath traveler 1 and 2 live a live and dragon quest 3 remake need to pick them up
The pacing is a little weird in places.  Like I go from super overleveled to why are things one shotting me
its on sale but i bought games
@blacktiger51 That's a lot of Team Asano stuff :O
oh they did octopath and the dragon quest 3 remake
He's the producer of those games and a few others altho I'm pretty sure like every game is made by a different studio technically so they're just called Team Asano cause it's largely the same group of people. They did Octopath, Bravely Default, DQ 1-3 remakes, Triangle Strategy, Various Daylife, and a couple other things
16 points away from 1 mil HOLD
Time to submit 10 plandos where it's just vanilla item placement.
@Penguin_Cuddles Make a vanilla rando except put like 1 key item in a super annoying spot
nah a plando where you do reverse all cards without cheating Kappa
Lol.  I did a plando with vanilla item placement before and the streamer got super pissed because they didn't know vanilla locations for the items.
It was oot...they knew the locations not the items in them.
I'm 10% the way to vip
I mean ig it's possible to have played a rando without ever having played the base game or at least only played it a couple times and not have had every location memorized.
Which is hilarious since I'm mostly a YouTube watcher.
almost been here for 3 years Analyze its been that long already
I checked and you had Sushie active when you entered the room then swapped
oh nvm you did exit and reenter
yeah idk then ig just weird placement
So nice of you to help them
Good to know for boss fights
1 in like 12 or 13 or however many you had left
ik you already picked up a goombario i don't remember about any others.
Wait I shoulda seen playing obs lmfao
Ngl I love the notifications about it.  Or the steam playing "stream avatars"
Not THE Goods ™️ but SOME Goods ™️
Ye nw I'm not done lol
Pushing penguins is not nice vampir7Itsfine
Mall Santa gave you his seed
Because your actually good at it.  First two were done first try.
I was gonna say it'd be funny if it costed 8 so it was a waste lmao
Now go beat up the mayor.  The bitch owes me fish.
I'm surprised we still haven't seen one
Oh the seed unlocks what dungeon is in 6 right?
If its volcano that speeds it up right?
But its a safety strategy since slower to retry then?
omg, tonights archi was so cursed
Makes sense.  Key logic is so weird sometimes.
I never got fly in emerald and goal was 6 legends
fly was on Majoras mask - stone tower temple mirror room sun block chest LUL
i even had fly prevented so I knew i wasnt getting it from the start KEKW
the room with a lot of mirrors
This location when flower fields door is still available and enterable!
i would love to do a mm ap if it was easier to set up
@Axl_SR YEP and that too much work
I didnt find TP that hard to setup and i had to install dolphin lol
I would love to do another ap but the first one I did ended halfway through since I got a bug and was softlocked.
once you set up tp the one time your good
ive ran it a ffew time
Hope you're doing well Phantom and GL with the Rando phanto274Lurk
i can actually do a lot out of logic in mm since bomb hovers are free unlike oot
" I exist. " - Me, on a regular basis
buff00n how many channel points you got?
Well i perscribe 50 CCs of cuddles.
I am exhausted... 6 archi syncs since thursday LUL
@Axl_SR the worst AP I had was someone else's go mode item was on a really quick check to get, but unfortunately that check required a key item and that key item was on a super late game quest that required going 30 min out of my way to get it. It was so long that by the time I got it I forgot that I didn't actually get the person their item, just the key item necessary to get it... LUL
ok i do have more but i only spent like maybe 40000
my issue took me YEARS to get over in it's entirety, that shit SUCKED
oh yeah, big gambles but not big enough to bankrupt me
I enjoy it with large groups, like 20+ and being able to finish around 3 or 4 hours
Remember kids, ALWAYS keep gambling and never let anyone tell you otherwise, you'll hit it big eventually!
I'm sorry???  What just happened.  Isn't there a boss???
@Ohrocks had a friend who actually won big, and IMMEDIATELY tapped out
also big fan of prehinting before starting cause it gives you a direction
" I'm done. I had my fun. "
I'd rather go even than lose anything tbh
best part, when the people he was with asked if he won anything, he said "no"
I lose $20 to slots, and stopped
@Axl_SR yeah some games I prehint some I don't, it really depends on the game.
normally i dont prehint for banjo cause I feel that game flows fast enouugh for my liking but for pokemon emerald i prehint my fly and all the abandoned ship dive locations
I like randos, but I'm not experienced enough to do crazy settings
just cause its such a pain to get to
depends on how long I'm at my coworker's wedding
anytime after 1pm est works for me
@Axl_SR FF12 I prehint mainly cause that game has about 50 key items that have checks locked behind them and while only like 5 of them are necessary to beat the game I don't want to run into a situation where I can't hint items I need to get stuff for other people. FF6 on the other hand is the exact opposite, it has 0 key items required to beat the game and only 14 that lock checks so I don't prehint for that cause I barely need hints anyway.
I should learn Minish Cap rando, for a lil' variety
I don't learn any of the randos I play I just know those games super well
I mainly do oot but I know alttp I could probably do that one.
the APs I mainly play are FF6, FF12, Ori 1, and Jak 1
Unfortunately most of the games I know really well don't have APs :(
I mean, I should get familiar enough with vanilla to know where to check for rando
Okami not having a rando is a tragedy that game is perfect for one...
one thing I wanted to ask about, when I do pape AP I auto track with emo tracker and its a better experience that using the pop tracker. The only things it doesnt track is cakemix, lemon, and cake. Was it like that before or is that a recent thing?
ALttP's the only game I know in it's entirety to feel good about rando'ing
i would do either pape or alttp this time
If I had more time/experience I'd love to work on a rando but alas.
Ive recommended someone to try emo tracker but they yelled at me for posting a minish cap link in the PM thread phanto274Smile
the tubba fight should also be randomized, make this sequence really awful LUL
7 scaled huff then crystal king back to back.
Oh for randomized bosses are they scaled based on the chapter they are in or their actual chapter?
did you see i posted in discord that my switch2 from target isnt arriving until the 11th lmao
i have one from walmart too arriving day of release so i should be fine
target one is going to my cousin
I am walking into the Costco I shop at, not work at, and am hoping for the best
I have to go to a Best Buy at 10PM with all the other freaks and weirdos
I like the black flowers.  Nice color scheme
obviously im super biased but I would reccommend others to try Banjo AP
as someone who never cared for Banjo, that sounds like CBT
just dont do Hag1 if you dont like the FPS controls lol
i want to have enough that I could put on a wheel and spin it to decide
ive got 4 games i know well enough to not use a map.
Ive done yoshis island in async, id like to try it in a sync tho
i just have universal replace the map
A self ap of 4 minish unknown setting randos where every 30 min auto swaps to a different version automatically.
would you be interested in shadow AP?
yo it was good playing some gundam
oh yeah, i seen a lot of your yt's found ya through there glad to see a rando live
Are you doing danger strats for power?
So do you have to do koopa koot and chuck quizmo for items?
So no koopa koot I think you said
Gotcha gotcha. Indy did one like 2 yrs ago and we were wracking our brains trying to figure out what to do for a hot minute lol
well it was my first ever grey lol
So you're saying you've only done it once or twice.
I also did it pretty blind lol vaguely remembered the game but hey it was fun the trap to glory is always satisfying
are you doing a race soon is that what I heard sorry I stepped away
if you get stuck on a trick just pass the controller to spikevegeta LUL
i was just thinking about my first time playing console and the only one I vividly remember is the wii
Oh indy and I were talking the other day. Is it even possible to rando ttyd? Seems too linear progression wise
I do remember my first experrence with snes but i was vvery young
Perfect timing to ask about it then lol
I was visiting my brother in the hospital, dont remember why he was in but while visiting a nurse wheeled in a snes with a CRT and we played SMW for the first time
@axl_sr we had nes when I was a kid.
so atari to snes was an eye opener
snes was rented at movie store once a year lol
my first experience on wii was friend had me try the fishing hole in twilight princess
My grandmother had an Atari and I played a McDonald's themed game but I was like maybe 5 lol
there was a helicopter game wasn’t there? like fly base to base to rescue hostages? I have a vague memory of that
Only helicopter game I played was jungle strike on PC before internet
thats what you get for glitching
I usually just watch vanilla cause it relaxes me lol
glitching is only allowed iif you are BK
oldest clip I have of you doing pape was complaining switch online doesnt have notches and i watchced your runs long before that
I gotta go harass someone else I sub too. Catch you soon
twitch is advertising Mario Kart World to me in Morph's chat
" Phantom begrudgingly saves the Yoshi kids "
damn, I was close on that Quick Change BP
have you ever noticed the shape of the wii nunchuck is similar to the middle pronge on the N64 controller?
like they literally ripped off that off an N64 controller
Indiana didn't suck entirely, got Kirby Canvas Curve with case, manual and game for $25
most places sold the cartridge solo for $40
oh yeah sea of stars got a free dlc
" it's old, so it's worth more money. Probably. " - some asshole
i might go for platinum looks easy
i know nothing missables so that's good
so do that and watch YouTube at the same time NOTED
so without saying who there is more party members beside the 3 right?
after doing TTYD yesterday what would you say is its "check of legends"?
i was pretty sure since the menu have 2 extra slots
like in DK64 "check of legends" refers to a check in forest that requires each kong and all 5 guns. Its awful for AP LUL
my 1st magic is gtg toilet room was legendary
why's Banjo and DK64 like this
am I allowed to say what CBT is?
let's be real, I've said worse
CBT stands for Canada Bus & Transport services Nodders
oh, I was expecting an abbreviation like KBF for chapter 1
Didn't even turn in the Vase smhing my head
the best check in mm rando if something in on fd check ( req all masks) YEP
someone had oot light arrows there in combo rando
Parakarry's not paid enough to do that much damage
1 time i was walking into final with nothing beside jump x2 so i hinted my damage stuff and nothing was in my game as i was at the final save point i get ping and something got my mega rush
in my practice seed yesterday my best damaging option for final was All or Nothing Mega Quake for 7 damage
also for 5 FP of which i had 10
it was about to be a 4 damage a turn fight KEKW
the ONE positive was that i had Ultra Watt
otherwise it would have been ultra Laki as my partner LUL
wait check 1 more time maybe something will have changed this time Kappa
d down jump is not that bad
go level up if you're that desperate
Frames lost to poison damage smhing my head
silent1053GG uksgmaGG crysta225Gg second55GG pripcyGG phanto274GG
time to run it back Kappa
I wish I was good enough at coding to do an assessment in an interview lol
Like, high school level? Or not even?
So specific you'd never see them in real life?
do you pronounce puwp a particular way or is it just poop
Ah. "Read my mind or you fail"
Reverse engineer the question and then answer it
I forgot what that one was
Damn. Can't believe Ghost-Phanto is going to get Bombette'd in order to escape
Like, ensuring you do in fact know the material you say you do. That's one thing. Giving you an assessment that is completely irrelevant is another
I sure as hell don't remember my classes lol
i'm doing wind waker for achievement of the month and remembering you going for the, what was it, 1000 hits on orca? lol
And they were only 5 years ago
Well now that you've said it won't come up lol
An upgrade to a partner you *have* is pretty nice
Well at least you know the scale now
Is Mega Quake *usually* 6??? That seems high lol
It goes in a door?! No way!
Seeing Bowsers Castle was not on my list today lol
I hope it's a 3-4 M-Seed race in your run cause I want the audience to witness Yeet-T
I havent played in a moment so I dont remember the coin bags lol
I assume it's just a lump of coins?
Tell me again in 90 seconds (ads)
I think the game is saying something about Merlow lol
Oh yeah, the sewer. Forgetted I did
A good time to get those
What was the sushi badge in Toad Town? Was that also Quick Change(trap), or Dizzy Attack?
That's so many eevees in the bg
Gotta go for a bit. Almost dinnertime here. Try not to die
also missing vaporeon to complete the gen 3 collection
Dw I was not being serious
I couldn't tell if you were being funny or not
I just meant all the eeveelutions through gen 3 but yeah the way I abbreviated it made it sound like only the gen 3 ones LUL
The irony in that there is no gen 3 eeveelutions lol
Why'd I think esp and umbreon were gen 3 I'm dumb...
ig cause colo and gale are gen 3 games.
ok I lost count at 5
That green was hard to work with lmfao
It was a really ugly green 😩
He's just a guy who kidnaps people
I like the lantern ghost :)
Indeed even if he did kidnap Watt he could still be really chill.
If he didn't kidnap watt who did
Just look at the serial Killer from Trivia Murder Party.  he is pretty aweslome despite being A MURDER!
anybody who says Whee hee hee when you meet them is good in my books phanto274Notes
I have no idea that game is too old for me :)
I feel like it’s 4 or 5
I know there are some in Bowser's as well
okay I haven’t seen these panel icons enough and man they look slick
Such a solid start this go round
devs really shoulda fixed this bug, super annoying that you can't see what you're doing when you enter the storeroom...
Just showing off for content. LUL
I've been playing this nuzlocke mod and it's kicking my ass
I died in a bs way right before a boss fight LUL
the nuzlock is just scooby but 1 hit and death means reset
idek if nuzlocke is the right word but yeah
lurking, while i fistfight youtube into letting me upload my thumbnails peache114Kill
that's cool, TP speedruns are sick
coleys died to sandwiches multiple times cause hes trying to 100% the scooblocke
cause snacks are inside the sandwiches
Last stream i watched was you using bombette to get those as you were hammerless.  That was CONTENT!  LUL
weve watched him going at the scooblock for weeks
i know nothing about pape rando despite the amount of times ive watched you run this
ooh going for slow go ledge off chest in ruins? that one is tough
You can have nothing and like it
Ask nicely and you shall receive
You just need to ask nicely more often apparently KEKW
why is it i upload a thumb nail, per video, and  save the changes each time
and then fivce minutes later youtube goes "hey actually there are no tumbnails"
youtube is a SCOURGE and i HATE twitch for removing its highlights feature
good luck with the rest of this run goodnight
like i brought this upon myself for even started to save all my vods in the first place, to the point i cant just *stop* now, but GODS
like i dont evcen make *content* theyre just the vods with intro/breaks clipped out and slapped right into youtube, i dont need to put much effort into this.
i just kinda skim the vod for if i see my brb screen or an extended pause where i stepped away, and just clip it out and thats it, because if anything it just makes for a shorter video
not garbage, has a value of 1 LUL
This will surely be a hard fight too Kappa
tingle is annoying. had to use his balloon to cross that gap on dragon roost and WHY IS THERE A COUNTDOWN TO ACTIVATION lmao
like buddy i'm trying to time the activation to when the jet isn't there, and your countdown means it activates as the jet starts
gotta take your frying pan and turn it into a drying pan
anyways i learned the other day that the guy who voiced that line as brock is also Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule from botw, isnt that crazy?
I think buff00n quoted it and I laughed that it was the first one
fuckin trusty stole my first quote
Is this the only thing you can do right now? monkaS
Well, guess we'll see if this is an unwall
i can finally chill and watch now
i just seen that you share something about Esquie
oh that was the 22th KEKW
want me to post the link to the art i got it
Maybe it'd be better to grab most of the checks after the boss?
Did you HS out of Bombette on a previous visit?
Hard to say then where the best place to route in Refund is
Oooookay finally back. How's the seed going?
oh yeah if i do pape for the next ap i have to update my yaml since its got updated Deadge
Yo good luck with the Pape lueygaGoodLuck
Stream was good for me, just more practice for the season 4 tourney
Can you not do the clip to bypass him?
okay i got like 4 setes of thumbnails uploaded with no issues, finally
now i gott amake another set for two more series
There's the UH block check in the sewer still, right?
... god dont tell me this is how i find out that my second paper mario vod didnt get highlighted and is now gone
welp, thats a series that isnt geting uploaded now
im pretty sure i did at least 2 or 3 sessions of that, but i only have the first vod for it peache114Sobbing
Inb4 Koopa Leaves are all frozen in Shiver City
Hey you can beat the Koopatrol now!
Well, there was a ton right at the start, so it sounds right
How was your archi the other day
Sounds fun for all the end game bosses
I wanna try the new build
I know the main dev plans to do more with it outside of just archi, so hopefully that leads to more development
Does the Bowser Door work from this entrance?
Woulda thought it was room state dependent. Statue being moved
But since you can't full clear without Laki, not much point rn?
Every time I see that trick I can never believe it being that simple lol
God I wish I had a good fireshell seed, that move is so much fun
He was almost a problem lul
Toy Train in the dungeon Toy Box leads too. Ironically randomized lol
Doesn't talking to the flower(Forget her name) make the moles slow down slightly?
Ah, that might be what I'm thinking of
Kappa You should eat the cake right in front of Gourmet Guy Kappa
Can't you just clip in there anyways when you actually get enough to go there?
Darn. What I get for leaving at the start lol
Time to swim with the feesh
Feels weird still for Jr to have been dead for ages
I might have to try a glitched seed like this some time, everything I've been doing has been so much more linear
That Partner upgrade on the way up coulda been Mega Bomb Kappa
No it hasn't been super common
Do you have a settings string for it? I might mess around and see what tricks I could learn
outin twas awsm and nice in time for 3 hr finale
Yeah I would be wanting to see yours cause I know there would be no LZS tricks NiceSoftlock
....Oh yeah. Not Crystal King lol
I'm more surprised Laki didn't show yet
okay i beat youtube into submission, all the vods that needs to have thumbnails now have thumbnails
Unless Rowf is holding him hostage too lol
my downloads folder is a hot mess now
i should delete everything in my download folder
I try to keep it organized when I get a new computer
I did too, I tried to stop doing it cause it was getting too much
i dont have photoshop i use photopea online, so i had to download each one to upload back to youtube, so there was alot lmao
That lasts about 2 weeks lol
I've been using Paint 3D for my rando VODS lol
There's a browser version of classic Paint
I've never tried Paint 3D lmao
i dont have any kind of art software installed on my pc, so photopea is just the easiest to just ge tup and going for me
I mean I prefer new MS Paint tbh
I didn't want to use Paint 3D but I had it so I just tried to deal with it
I use paint dot net personally as well
I use .Net and CSP too
i used to use clip studio, im pretty sure i own it on my ipad?? i use it there when i do doodles and whatnot
I use GIMP for anything too complex for Paint to handle.
If you want old MS Paint for any reason, JS Paint exists
i used desktop version back in ye olde days when i used to do digital art, but those days are long gone
i cant stand gimp or fire alpaca
i just google a wallpaper for game, slap on the transparent logo and a big ol number, and bam thumbnail done
I mean GIMP is more akin to photoshop it's not very great for making art but it's really nice for editing images which is what I normally use it for.
I'm just glad there are other free alternatives besides GIMP now
I've been boomerishly use SNIP and Paint 3D
screenshots from stream would be smart, but my layout makes that difficult
Wait, isn't Paint 3D discontinued on Win11 too? I'm going to have to learn something else anyways lmao
I have some sort of art program but I forget wtf it's called cause I never make art. I also have aesprite but I never use that lmao.
oh yeah i like your thumbnails, i like how your little custom ghost guy is on there
ive been debating using my emotes on my thimbnails to personalize them, but im just... so lazy
He has 10 in vanilla, right?
yeah I was gonna guess that is what's happening.
And that's Chapter 3... That's really weird
I guess cause you can encounter him in the castle so he's scaled on that???
Even then, he'd have max Defense, but the HP should still be the same, I think?
Interesting... Wonder if that's intended or a bug
sorry but the thumbnail for your first expedition 33 video, masterpiece
Okay 7 is even more bizarre
"did you know roughly 1/7 people have a foot kink" with just the funniest still image
oh so I guess that's why
so it takes on the scaling of the heart
So does Tubba scale match Heart scale?
Where is the damn Cloud bro
But Super Blooper wants to fight you though phanto274ColonD
well, thankyou for being very good lurking noise as i worked on a bs amount of thumbnails, but i have to go to bed, i gotta bunch of steel to cut tomorrow (i am learning oxy/acetaline cutting)
gotta add that to my resume right under FORKLIFT CERTIFIED
i am! i got my certification last week lmao
nope lol, i went and got it last week
i like how the sound effect is too long for the cutscene
i got aspestos, skid steer, excavator, fire watch, propane, forklift, and now cutting and burning
i am quite stacked in skills
my boyfriend says i am "specced up to fight the final boss" and thats  indeed a quote of all time
idk who the final boss in contruction is, but clearly i am ready
Well, at least you don't have to do stone skip
if only you hadn't skipped close call you could have em both on!
I gotta say I hate lining that jump up off the chest
it'd be funny if there was an option to randomize the dodge chance close call / lucky day / pretty lucky give :D
I love how they change colors once they're completed lmao.
Oh shoot, Laki, where did he wind up being?
they should prolly make that partner upgrade be like gray cause I thought it was just sitting there the first time you went past it lmao.
yeah ig those are just more transparent than the partner upgrade one maybe that's the issue.
I might actually play with panels in the future with these hints
otherwise I thought it was horrendous, especially when racing
i needed hints for invisible blocks
i miss it where was laki?
Why does the machine require one hit on the right side anyways?
the cloud turned into an ice king
Weight was Green Station past the moving blocks, I think
Ultra Stone maybe? You start with it on, right?
what about combining the ruins stones?
Yay, I made a good suggestion
Damn, can't believe Peach and Daisy swapped kingdoms for today
He wants the repel gel wars
Man I need to get staples for my deck
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
phanto274Smile watching you play with Espe
heeey its the green power ranger!
i wonder who thinks sewers are these elaborate labyrinths made by the people of yor
Yaaay my suggestion was good after all
Well, at least it's not the Bario
whats the grey key with a ?
Chill Out Phanto. It was just a prank Kappa
Why does not chat show on stream?
Not as many Star Pieces as yesterday
Nothing like early dinner and a show
they changed the recipe and since then its a tad worse
Neither do I. And to me it tastes like *lies*
Does Bombette not work on those trees?
also i gotta say depending on where coke or pepsi is made the taste is wildly different
pepsi in europe is awful. in the usa its amazing
What are the other 2? I honestly can't recall any others
So last time I asked this, ads came up, what do the Coin Bags do?
So like TTYD Arch. Yeah that checks
Oooohhh, the one in the Snowman room
would be funny if those blocks gave 10 random items
I'll never not be impressed at how good at mashing you are lol
Crystal Palace 15 minutes in? We love Dungeon Shuffle
ended with hyper light drifter speedruns but the game fucked me a couple times lol I almost got peeved
Tell me about it. Finally turning into Summer here in the Northeast. The pollen is just starting to fall
they were getting cold watching you in Crystal Palace
Phanto uses the wrong units. 100F
did you check the star piece rewards?
Dojo is only in logic after 1 chapter, right?
golden piggy should be a check
BRO YOU TELL ME!! My AC needs to be serviced. thermostat is a blank screen and it turns on randomly. They will be here Thursday morning so just 2 more nights of this.
excited for thursday, and not for the switch 2
How was the archipelago btw? Bummed I missed it
lord i had fun, I finished it and had 30 minutes before the next one
Imma just assume the upgrade was for WeLoveGoombario
I love them when I have power or mega quake
in the pape archi channel someone made an archi sprite for the game and its not even the right size.
yeah, icebound already has the file for like 2 years ago lol
I thought the license was changed to MIT
I'd say Forest considering you have to wait for the transition to get back to the Mario house pipe
oh whoops... I saw the greyed out item sprite earlier, took a screen cap and posted it on bug reports LUL
i didnt no it was a feature
I didn’t even know you could do this
@CaptainMD13 ah if only I could post mp4s in here lmao I'd post the intro to R&C 3 when Clank says "I stand corrected" upside down LUL
Lotta shops selling coins these days
so whhat are the different panel icons?
pretty sure that was red key
Different panel icons are item hints for what's inside
@Axl_SR hints for what is underneath the panel, there's consumable item, badge, key item, star piece, partner upgrade, and coin I think.
Jade Raven on the island. Thanks game, very random lol
ugh why do that to yourself
I've never been good at those jumps
i hope pape AP deathlink can be implemented
yeah there are some bonkers jumps you can do in spots lol. Like iirc you can jump over the mirror at the entrance to Crystal Palace but it's like TAS only basically.
the issue is it causes too many crashes
There's the gap in Gusty Gulch you can skip too
Deathlink in a game with manual saving only in certain spots sounds evil af tbh.
Well it is very strangely shaped compared to a flat wall lol
upgrade block in yellow flower path is worse if you ask me
banjo has something like that. In vanilla you have to save 3 dinos and you only get 1 jiggy for your trouble but in AP each 1 jives a check plus the jiggy. Its a really long quest.
banjo did that for like 5 or so different checks
Yeeeaaahh. Lotta Mumbo uses for that one
you got Scroty, Skivys, Mr Fit, Ms Boggy, there is quite a few
One thing I didn't like about Tooie. Lot more complicated and needing a lot more setup for certain checks
gryo, honestly I wish we had more games like that
I still loved Tooie, don't get me wrong. Just wish some parts were a *bit* easier lol
Too far for Kooper this time Kappa
alright have fun, I put better wind waker on my gamecube and wanna learn WW AP
Is your room feeling better now?
sounds awful hopefully it gets fixed soon
Also 27 here in Canada atm
Supposed to get up to 29C on Wednesday
I hate it when that happens
I'm sorry, were all 3 of those Star Items?
Wasn't that check a coin yesterday too lol
I didn't even know regular enemies COULD cap you
Fuzzy was Stone Cap I think?
Brb. Try not to break the seed
Aight I'm back. What I miss?
Still no Para or Laki I see
this is normal and expected phanto274Smile
I am so confused by everything that just happened lol
The lower one is a lot bigger than that one is
Is the Red Vase check not included?
I think it's Red Vase anyways
took a quick look at the volcano coding. I messed up the patching for that LZ, will put that on my todo list, my b
that lz force-disables all partners, so youd also fall off of laki or let go of watt
Could you do it with the lower right LZ?
yeah, silly stuff happens if one patches the same function twice on accident phanto274S
i do patch that room, but again only the LZs
Desert has powered you up but not progressed you
That is so weird looking lol
just checked decomp, there's a scripting difference in the spike roller room between jp and us
jp just waits for the player to come close to a trigger point. US instead checks the player's x-coordinate instead of distance from a point, and additionally force-disables partner abilities on trigger
The best gift to give Lacky is yourself
Screw you laki, now go get us some shoes
Two seeds in a row with late Laki is kinda crazy
Don't think I've ever seen that trick
Ultra hammer and shoes here with Laki what an insult
This box was loaded with everything minus parakarry
I'm here on behalf of the Baguette emote, I came for vengeance
I'm going through a Paper Mario Tower of Trials hyperfixation that will soon get completely murdered by Deltarune tomorrow
I love Tower of Trials have you played it?
Wish I could justify getting a Switch 2
I never heard of that mod
Red Bombette kinda reminds me of Luigi's cherry bob-omb partner
I don't know what a green Watt could be referencing
Say farewell to this theme soon
enemies been hitting really hard in sea of stars
So seeds to grow Chapter 3
They even changed the falling animation to be quicker, that's neat
this rando has spoiled me when trying others frankly
But like compared to the pokemon ones when I was doing AP or the MLSSS ones it’s not close
I’m sad cause it has good bones but it needs more
the not working on console sucks too
I’m sure TTYD has more demand too
I will say playing the remake I was struck just how linear every chapter is. I’d heard you say it but I guess I didn’t feel it until I played it again
Tough to make a rando that doesn’t just feel like backtracking simulator
No, the removal of spinning is a travesty
Gotta grow our way to Tubba's home
damn double rock block, now you’re just styling on us
okay that probably is but I’ve never blocked the tutankoopa one NiceSoftlock
I hate how big these areas are
I feel like the whole gusty gulch area should be the same area, kinda weird that you have to go across the map to get over here.
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
yeah i can see sub chat but not the vc
what do you use for the discord icons?
Shit happens.   We still love you LuvSign
And even then you can just give the items lol
Releasing that early will throw logic out the window unfortunately 😅
This isn't paper mario unfortunately haha
Give it enough seeds in general and you give less shits about logic
why phantommmm making me choose who to watch
These take a while if that helps the decision making
I go to grab a snack and waddle back in to the suicussy.  vampir7Itsfine
That was my nickname back in collage HypeLol
It drank too much Baja blast
I'm colorblind and this still hurts my eyes
Holy and black bolts.  Phantom giving all the magic
He's just watching from the background watching you suffer.
And water is special in this gen too right?
belias was just vibing on the grass
He caught belias in his net
That magmar sinned way too much
Took me a while to find the emote.  They shoved it all the way at the bottom
Ooh snap Pokemon Crystal version? PogBones
The most crystalline of all the pokemon releases?
why are the names in discord talking shortened to “a…” and “b…”
it's specifically if their display names are the same as their usernames
Hope it's not locked behind an annoying side quest haha!
so is that a setting you can turn off?
well it's also that way so that if you're streaming with someone and chatting with them, their usernames aren't exposed to literally everyone watching the stream
and thus potentially getting unwanted friend requests and DMs and stuff
imagine if every entry in the pokedex was a rando item
That magmar needs to be removed from existing
can be worse. small or big pokemon and male female pokemon as items as well
Because you need to "full clear" catching an area before moving to the next one. It's...bad.
most people play randomizers to have fun not to feel pain stalkor :P
Mirby but phantom plays no logic so we know they like pain.
I know was clarifying haha HypeLol HypeLol HypeLol HypeKO
Oh thats a dick move vampir7Itsfine
which games are in the ap?
ff12? hope you have nice settings
I need to eventually do an ap.  Been a while due to work since I joined in on any.  I've done a few solo ones which are nice.
Half the pokemon decided to drink nuclear sludge
i still think the funniest randomized tm i ever got was in an ORAS rando and steven was like "this is one of my favorite moves use it well" and he gave me the TM for growl
I'm more worried about the banjo tooie jolly Rodgers dubloons being SINGLETON.  Hopefully nothing locked behind them
Oh goodie.  A dark stone.  That's needed for a slow side quest in 12
You literally have to wander the desert filling the dark stone with light.
I've convinced the partner to try out 9 finally
I did enjoy the license system since you could plan it out and diversity the party
Hey electabuzz isn't that bad /joking HypeFire
whens mario kart world coming to ap?
that would be soooo many checks
"I actually needed that bundle of hair"
Cops wasting our time during pride month.  That's homophobic HypeLol HypeFire
I just sent you death HypeKO
We're gonna have a lv 100 alakazam by the end
Vanilla in my randomizer?  Is this even randomized?
So wait...if you accidentally skip past the trainers does that just lock out the checks?  That seems kinda...bad
Yup you mentioned.  I would hope maybe if you beat the leader it just gives you all of them
these usually make it so the flag making them unfightable is never set
So many checks unlocked with surf
i could swear this apworld did that when maddy did that
i saw it get taken over
Oh boy, trainersanity? I've always wanted to give that a shot
Are you at least using the autotracker?
Well I wish you the best of luck
It's fine.  Umbie had his blood
How many people runnin this AP?
Sweet. You playing to Red, 16 badges required?
Does the I spy give pannel hints?
Aww.  I was hopeful it was actually useful haha
there's a slight difference on my end
so slugma looked high af instead
blissey is coated in the blood of all her foes
The real crime is we have only seen one trans dunsparce
If its boots I'll die laughing
phantom about to waterboard the rival here
The kobutos just looking over as the trainer gets waterfalled
So when are we beating up some cops?
that is quite a trip lmao
Holding down speedup for 12 hours
glhf, I committed many art crimes today fatpidRise
the gay audacity is stronk in pride also happy pride
One of these times I'll see about makin it in for an Archi, there's a Celeste/MM beta available apparently ovo
They only commit hate crimes at night
I'm glad they let you have your bike indoors
nah I'm chill with that Silver's a jackass
one of the best rivals tbh
the pixels are so epic on these bettershinies
that Xatu makes me wish Xatu shiny was that color
I saw a pink Xatu once in Pokemon Stadium 2 and I was *so mad* when I found out what it was like normally
The alakazam is a vibe tbh
do some sprite touch ups and it'd be a great colorway
Black and green raikou makes love
ayo trans rights houndoom tho?? based
Beating up some police.  Happy pride.
So we are still beating them up
someone help me balance my trainer budget I cannot buy food for my pokemon (x99 repels are off limit)
They are chasing waterfalls it seems
oh, no squirtbottle I take it?
kefka's tower is just homophobic tbh
all you had to do was follow the damn moon, CJ
i just spent $50 on a copy of OutRun
it comes with an entire Yakuza game
the egg is making sounds. it sounds like "help it's dark how did i get in here what the hell"
smoochum says "give me my fucking checks or else"
seriously why is gen2 smoochum's sprite so aggressive
it's gonna try stealing my lunch money
ah yeah i never noticed, I had some bathroom outlets to change
so they need all the magic beans?
when i hooked my switch 2 up initially it was through the capture card but it wasn't actually showing so i assumed the capture card wasn't working with the switch 2
today i realized that was because i never actually hooked it up to my capture card lmao
my PS5 was still plugged into it the entire time
so mm and crystal were the hard locks it seems
I've really had to tweak my AP settings for crystal to avoid these hard walls. Like putting pass/squirtbottle in my local game or enabling a free fly location / early fly
I usually play with people who run shorter games, so I also only do 13 badges to unlock Red. I do like all the customizability the AP has
We need a Link to the Pass Kappa
that's the name of our baby btw PrideLaugh
Oh I saw fucking gta guy and got very confused
You picked the wrong house fool
I can't believe the quicksand got the bot
seeing MMR at this framerate is freaky tbh
Can I humbly request some National Park music? Goldenrod is gettin' to me
music change sounds like a good idea
fun fact: playing this minigame with Gatomon is impossible
Swamp archery's not as bad :v
not that small actually! but *just* short enough to hit the fence no matter what
which sucks cause it's an excellent model otherwise
this is how mm is meant to be played
Oh, you have to have razor or better
goombario? wow this multiworld is ruined
when the ACAB hits (all checks are blocked)
5 hr prt with phantom no better way to spend a day
thanks! lasted longer than I was expecting, but had a lot of fun with it
Red is the previous MC and tbh I wish more sequels did that
crysta225Gg orcris1Gg phanto274GG second55GG pripcyGG uksgmaGG silent1053GG
The crystal is done crystaling :(
MM is easy to get locked up in 😔
@FatPidgeyBirb tranforms and arrow styles are hyper alphas.
This is one weird crystal rando
thanks for the stream and the multi
I wanna be fucked like pape any%
I realized music was still quiet from yesterday lol
This music is ironic since I've been playing wind waker haha
hopefully you don't have to wait 2 hours for boots smilers
I'm tidying up, my space is a mess atm
Doing good, just chillin today .. happy I can make it for once str9ngLove
keep some of that music in the youtube upload, if possible
tired to do a check and banjo and cant get it, looks up logic, does exactly same thing then it works. Lesson: checking logic makes stuff work KEKW
One of these days goombario is gonna be goombario
You asked and you got something
it's not a coin, I guess
yeah stone cap is great for stalling, gives 3 turns
btw, strange cake repel gel lasts 3 turns
if you could find an FP plus, maybe that'll help
i come back and you already have super boots Madge
it's time for an old tradition
"It's only 4pm your time" okay, AND???
I don't know what this means
phantom, i think we want more emotes KEKW
amazing i got that line KEKW
that's an oddly appropriate voice line, ngl
i largest hype train ive been in got to level 16, it was their first stream back in months lol I got BleedPurpleHD
it goes up to 16? I didn't know that
yeah it showed it could go 130+
yeah the guy got about 100k in subs and bits
i THINK i 100% the windswept demo
someone dipped cuz of @everyone? that's crazy
Was it Ice? I know he hates Kappa lol
i don't think they would leave over that lol
I'm on mobile and you were only 5 seconds off
my user name is from 2009 YEP
we only get it for 24 hours?
more original than using your birth date, imo
when i got my xbox 360
you saying phantom wasn't born in 5800 BC? rude
Only 24 hours??? More then a little silly.
I'm "buff00n" cuz I was running an Inspector Gadget pfp on a forum WAY back when
yeah, my notifications say only 24 hours
my user name on psn have a X  at the end cuz someone took my name Madge
thankfully i'm mirbystudios basically everywhere. except here. because someone's camping on the version without the underscore and twitch does not give a fuck
pretty sure my friend took it
It's so weird when my username is taken...like wtf
GL and I know I only just saw discord notifications 😭
Axl was pretty free, no one uses it LUL
i'm not one of their precious partners nor will i ever be
No, they don't care about partners anymore
i'd agree but partner+ is open to affiliates too lol
Yes but that means they make enough money to be in the care-eligible tier YEP
who stuffed parakarry in a box lmao
It's like the ad-free premium tier
i imagine parakarry lost someones mail and they stuffed him in that box
Did you know that 20% of all Paper Marios contained recycled paper?
A, ty @Amishman19 for the sub!! ✨
I've been lurkin as I'm committing more art crimes, my hands are dirty with paint currently
clearly I brought bad luck upon this stream cause that's the first thing I saw was you struggling with the clip NotLikeThis
then I alt-tabbed for like 2 seconds and you got it LUL
did you turn in the vase?
Not getting the life alert stone.
Coming at you straight?  During pride month.  How dare.
gonna lurk while playing mario kart
it will never not be funny to me that the gametal go straight streets of rage remix was drawn in june
like it was put on the to-do list from the june drawing. the song called "go straight"
yes that was a door you went in
@Mirby_Studios should've been the PXZ2 remix, smdh
i mean that wasn't the point lmao
Well then.  Bean might actually be here at this rate
So they just shuffled within themselves haha
Still not as bad as the all white shy guys HypeFire
Nope.  I ate the fish HypeLol HypeKO
I am making mac and cheese while taking a break from mk world
been having a blast w it
cannot hear "peaches" without thinking about that Bowser song
yeah I plan on going back to totk after the break
World OST is SO damn good, for no reason
I just wanted to play with it a bit unlock some costumes
KO Tour is where it's at
im finaly gonna give pokemon scarlet a proper chance     also veiwer mk lovbbys when?
Scarlett / Violet is a functional video game on Switch 2
I had fun with ko tour
Not until there is a mk rando /joking
@buff00n is why me finaly gonna try it properly
2P KO Tour is THE most fun I've had in a Mario Kart game
you just play with your friends instead
unless your friends are the try hards
the tryhards are already out in full force
ah yeah that's my issue lmao
that's why none of my friends don't have it yet
I'm not THAT tryhard, I'm just trying to keep up
If I played Mario Kart I'd be a tryhard cause I play like actual racing games lmao.
me, playing Celeste: who are you calling a sweaty-
it helps that the intermission tracks are mostly straightaways
so you can't just drift to win
the NPC on mk world are brutal
i lost 1st due to a bus on one of races
in friend lobbies you can hit + to manually select a track and if it wins it's the full 3 lap versino
yeah can't do it on like ranked
in public if random gets hit it 3 lap
yeah that's how you do it there
you just get more control in friend lobbies
VS Race also lets you do a single track, as does Time Trials
vvs race also lets u pick where to start and which lv to race to
me with any racing game Deadge
yeah same with the + menu in friend lobbies
you can just do the course as is or do the intermission route
Phantom, did you know Double Dash AP has 200CC
COMs are not balanced for it, they just drive off the track LUL
how would mk ap even work lmao
@PeachedPocky you get checks for winning races and unlock tracks ig idk lol.
mario kart world AP would work, it would be a lot of checks tho. just do freeroam challenges lol
shuffle tracks, shuffle classes like 50CC !00CC, ect, shuffle characters, shuffle items, there is alot in DD
of course that requires a lot more than just connecting it
I mean you can always make a manual for it lmao
they def found stuff, the double dash that played in my group on sunday had 170 checks
well I'm going back to Mario kart (or tears? idk) but I be lurking, good luck with your fun
each track has 1st, finish, take the lead, time trial. Each class cup has broze, silver, gold, and perfect. it adds up fast
can't be worse than trackmania rando
characters, tracks, and I was told items are characters specific so like you may get mushrooms but only luigi can use them, ect.
i did an AP with a friend playing trackmania.... all the medals zfgNoDude
"way of the hero" its all silver medals zfgRunOgre
The oilers got annihilated last night Madge the panthers are leading 2-1
it seriously destroy the logic and hint systems lmao
are they user created tracks or the base ones?
my friend got a bunch of track he just could NOT figure out
nice made it for the dark king
i wasnt sitting on checks I did over 800 LUL
Is this like turn based ?
The best turn based game in history
It's possible to tell the difference? I thought it was the third one cause it was less transparent than the other two when the spun at the start
@Midnaliin idk Pong is up there...
i dont see world holding my attention for very long
@darkness3827 That’s not turn based KEKW
i thought I heard icebound or pronyo say there is no way to tell them apart?
@amishman19 do you go to the oiler watch parties?
@Midnaliin wdym I hit ball, then you hit ball, then I hit ball again, that seems like turns to me LUL
@Midnaliin I'm usually a watch at home kind of guy, don't drink so unless my friends wanted to go out don't do so usually
If person hitting ball doesn’t get 10 hours to decipher the best ball hitting strat it’s not turn based Kappa
Listen I'm not a regular Albertan
Although I do own a truck so maybe I'm not that far off NiceSoftlock
people flush valuable stuff down the toilets, including shoes it seems
yo amish ty for the sub
Yo lopez you're welcome for the sub
oh you meant in the game :P
just use parakarry as a shield he'll sacrifice himself to carry you through the lavafall obviously
The parakoopa can barely lift Mario’s fat ass KEKW
idk I watched a dude chuck another dude like 10 feet while standing in lava in the movie Volcano how hard can it be...
I love how Mario can't see but these guys have nightvision goggles
It’s not even dark Mario’s just heavily concussed
well to be fair Mario just came from a super bright room, meanwhile the koopas have lived their entire lives in that room so they're pretty used to the dark at this point.
Phantom are you learning Shrek 2 after this PauseChamp
I was going to yesterday but it’s not working on my dolphin rn lol
I get the disc this weekend so next week by latest
can't one shot without hammer, so truuu
It’s cuz you made it look EX
you just line it up and jump over them how hard can it be???
Yes that is max funny NiceSoftlock
I send via DM when you get a min
I still need to rub n buff but soon 👁️ comes painting some shelves. then gluing and sealing and mounting on my wall
and then I get to work on welding a lampshade frame and... goin from there to make one of those ancient ugly lampshades full of WHIMSY
shroom so hot you frie eg
wait lightning is that likely? damn
That doesn't seem right though, its either you get it or you don't, so it should be 50% bluesClueless
time to go on a journey
god i hate fishing in sea of stars
there a trophy for catching all so have to do it
I've been trying to lose for 3 weeks now
I'm 6-0 in the last 3 weeks....
I don't want to win LUL
ik I'm saying if you try winning then you'll lose clearly since you keep winning when you try to lose
avarie1Wave phanto274GL how did the rest of that ap go?
yeah you were going back and forth between goldenrod and new bark I think
like the upstairs key on my laki fight smilers
Oh, BTW, cause I totally missed this. Thanks for the sub LordofDuh phanto274ColonD
I didn't even notice that I got lucky with a sub! Thank you buff00n!
then don't live in a volcano
every single voice line today been timed i swear
when is your run on Sunday?
2 of em a blue!? wtf!?
maybe that shouldn't be a check?
is there any way you coulda done this seed faster given the logic? That felt pretty awful yeah
And you needed to beat all 5 to get Toy Train
done with chores in time to type gG
I think ima make some salsa while you break
you'll work it off, it's fine
@Phantom5800 I click the link and immediately see, "use code DILF for 15% off!", alrighty then
Phantom did you remember to make your random Tuesday morning game announcement?
They didn't say much but the little footage we have suggests it's gonna be some sort of single player survival game
Also they didn't provide a release window
Needed to do something positive to counteract every negative fiber of my being right now.
Not bringing it into your stream, though.
Just gonna set volume to extremely low and lurk for sleeps.
assuming that was added for rando
Good! Switch 2 BOTW this time
only switch 2 game i care about is metroid prime 4
Prime 4 is my most anticipated game this year. Kirby Air Riders is a close 2nd
I've never played any Warriors games
does logic account for scaling at all or nah?
Did you get a super hype train
Did you get your switch 2 btw?
Have you liked wrold from what you've played
Im assuming you got the bundle lol
Knockout tour is where its at tho
Im a big fan of the route tracks
Also in vs and online you can chose to do 3 lap tracks
It took me hours of grinding to get swoop and fish bone
Pretty sure kamek is the most rare item
I just cheated free roam to get them
Im guessing you arent gonna care much abt world tour
From what I know abt you
For me, its just been Ill do it when Im bored
As someone who enjoyed the hell out of the open world modes in the MX vs ATV games I'd prolly really enjoy that in Mario Kart but idk that wasn't enough to entice me to get a Switch 2 rn but I'll prolly get one at some point
You need 10 peach medallions for mirror but thats it
And I dont care abt mirror
I mean idk you could lock characters/vehicles behind getting them
All the characters with costumes are in grand prix and the npcs are from kamek
I do wish they gave the npcs outfits
Mainly bc I use peepa and pokey
For dlc Im assuming we're just gonna get an entire ass 2nd island
Also i think kinf bob-omb would be cool
74 put me on his family plan
So I have gc emulator as well
Removed you and raven but not buff00n
I learned something today playing mario kart
Also I had the same issue that buff00n had where my switches kept crashing during transfer
I thought I lost my digital files
Bc virtual game cards suck ass
you gotta set switch 2 as the master system
My master system is currently my brothers OLED
But idk how to do it
I had nintendo supp do it
actually the setting is in eshop
one minute in a online race
Switch 2 officially sold 3.5 million units
Im waiting for xd and coliseum
Thats why I never did runs
Bc the rng manip confused me lol
What does a coin bag do?
I own both physically, got XD new as a kid but didn't get Colo till like 2010ish or so. Only played through Colo once but played XD a ton of times.
I also have the XD themed Gamecube but that's not really worth any more than the reg one afaik. Also it's a pretty lame special edition.
in eshop you go to your icon in corner > settings > pass enabled console > deregister
If deregister is grey is it all good?
if its greyed out you need your master console to deregister
sea of stars is getting really good
my switch 2 lets me deregister meaning its my primary system
don't really want to give more info for people who haven't play
So what do I do on the primary console axl
if you want to change your primary system you deregister it, then on the system you want your main you register it
they made it confusing and hid it on eshop of all places
I only found out cause I watch kit and kyrsta
phantom, I almost bought arkham asylum on switch cause it was 10 bucks... now its 25 again lmao
i have that on ps4 and haven't played it
got that and city for 10 bucks a long time ago
yeah, id rather not dig out my PS3
i have played both on ps3
i have beat arkham knight tho
the problem Lakilulu not used to doing the clips that's why it took so many tries.
i use to like open world games but there too many and most are too big
I like open world games in some instances but generally they are too empty.
you see i really like the spider man games
i have the platinum for both
miles morales was the perfect length
spiderman 2 is really long too
i haven't play miles morales its always on sale when I'm broke KEKW
at least with spiderman 2 you can have different skill trees
and i am not playing 64.99 can for it
so the 2 can play different
i only get games on sale or there are a few i will pay full price for
I feel like games like OOT or 64 where it's a bunch of segmented open areas is the best mix cause you still have the ability to explore and stuff but generally its way less empty because they are divided up instead of just being one big area.
like silent hill f and re 9 i will get day 1
just grabbed the last 2 shantae games I was missing since they are half off this week
i bought og re 4 today for the rando KEKW
now that I beat advance I can start revenge lol
dont knock it til you try it, ill send you the APWorld KEKW
that why you do that as async Kappa
FFXII is also a single player MMO literally :P
ah yes ff 12 another game in my back log
know what was hype? the FF14 midnight launch
I've never played 11 so I can't really compare the two but yeah really the only similarity between the two is the combat system.
I walked out of gamestop with Hatsune Miku Project Diva F LMAO
Oh and also FFXII having a raid boss LUL
The only MMO I ever really got into was Toontown Online which says a lot about me
Except its singleplayer so the fight takes 3 hours NotLikeThis
I joined a slow pitch league KEKW
We played the best in the league though so pretty good
I think Toontown's player base ended having a lot of impact on my sense of humor
Toontown sounds like it was lit I wish I played back when it was alive
@Midnaliin There are 2 really good fan servers for it nowaday
Nah last time I played an online game like that I dropped 2 grand trying to get the best items KEKW
If they add a Battle Royale mode DLC then it'll be close enough :P
I used to be obsessed with ourworld for any OGs that know
Just had the cleanest W in mario kart just now
I want like an actual battle royale tho like battle mode but it's 100 people and it's on the full island lmao
I played Poptropica but not a ton
I was like 7 when it came out KEKW
That makes me glad I have no idea what it is KEKW
I specifically played it for the Peanuts crossover they did
(Also on the younger side around here)
The survivor island on that was so fun
where you could play through the plot of "It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"
Poptropica is a boomer game at this point lol
My best friend got caught “cheating” in club penguin when she was 8 that story fucking sends me KEKW
@Midnaliin Lmao how do you cheat in Club Penguin?
I also played a lot of Club Penguin but it was hard for me to stay invested in because it didn't have RPG elements
monkaW i was almost in high school
No like she was cheating on her club penguin bf and they both went to her igloo and she panicked LMAO
Like that story will never not send me
@Midnaliin oh that kind of cheating
Okay that was not the cheating I was expecting lmao
If I remember correctly, pop tropica is like total drama island but as a game?
when did i get old Sadge
Its been a minute so idk
I typed that and looked at my screan and pokey was falling off a cliff
Phantom drew the first cave painting guys
although more like exactly a month old
I was 2.5 when this game came out in Japan. Exactly 1 month before my 3rd b-day when it reached NA tho.
I guess I'm not that out of place in current chat
I think my brother got Paper Mario for his birthday when it first droppd
did anyone play Webkinz at any point?
I got called old today so I’m okay feeling young KEKW
I'm going to be 30 in a month and I'm feeling old here pepeW
@seventyfourtg I SPILLED MY WATER TRYING TO ANSWER BUT YES LOL
a friend told me I've looked young the entire time I've known her, I immediately found a grey hair in my beard the next day
I haven't found any in my beard yet 🤞
For a sec I thought you meant the age 74 LUL
but yeah Webkinz was a game where you would buy plushies irl and take care of them in the online MMO
YES omg I had so many
I gave my fish to my friend and I remember my mom got so heated for no reason KEKW
I still have my old ones lying around somewhere
The first one I bought was the platypus that was so hype
I think I just bought all the cats cause my family had 2 cats so I liked cats so I got all the cats.
@Midnaliin mine was a blue hippo
OMG I’m jelly I wanted that one
I recently got my fave sticker cards and cards from neopets
Although to be fair when I was like 6 playing it I didn't know what to do and probably remade an account like 8 times Kappa
neopets was too complicated for my simple brain
I just remember the omelette over and over again
Webkinz had flash clones of a bunch of arcade games and they were lit
Wait, you had online before christ?
miniclip was the big one in school, everybody was playing flash games in junior high
That's crazy, I can barely even remember a time before cell phones were everywhere
i got my mom old flip phone in high school
my most vivid memories of miniclip were the games were the presidential candidates would fight each other
The wild part about those games were when someone dropped out of the race you could no longer play as them
Oh man that must have been after my time
the minclip fighting, the phones not as much
Oh man it's getting late, been nice chatting for a bit but I should go to Bedge
Oh yeah one game from miniclip that I still have a soft spot for is Raft Wars
You play as a baby who digs up gold on the beach and everyone is out to get you and your brother
If I win my next, someone should gift me a sub
I always played bug on a wire on mini clips KEKW
The twist ending is you rescue your parents and it turns out they also want your treasure and are the final bosses
i am the king of dodging subs
My pokey was throwing it back
god enemies do so much damage in sea of stars
Alright, I gotta get up to gym at 5 so gotta hit the hay. Fun stream today and hope the seed finishes well!
So cows in the mario world are called Moo Moos, and the Moo Moo in MK is apparently names Cow
yeah game is not easy now
Thats like if I name my 1st born Human
idk that makes sense to me
I ain't trying to see a scotman's junk
no you're looking up their junk
into... the rest of their body ig???
or maybe you're googling them who's to say?
Wait Ive been playing mario kart fir over an hour?
I started when the run was at 50 minutes
oh wait you meant twitch sub
Hmm if i ban Pallos he doesn't have to watch ads anymore Kappa
So that means if I ever get randomly banned for reasons
I mean if they're that determined they can just sign out lol
there was guy I used to watch who had this stalker that would dm any unbanned user asking them to ask the stream for his unban
It was a problem for a while
okay, I'm not too crazy about Rosalina's new VA. Not bad, but she and Peach sound too similar
the fuck up thing is peach old va didn't find out about the re cast until the game was out
she did record the lines and got paid for it
It was pouring fucking raining for the first 25 minutes, so I was hella unfocused and lost by 2 mins
Thought my power was gonna go out
I was constantly walking into walls and dying to silly thing early
My first 5 items were... bow, red ring, ladder, silvers and a heart container
I think I ended with 6 hearts
my bet is last location YEP
where go mode here ch 5 or neither do that yeah?
sorry phantom, can't gamble today, i'm 12 channel points away from a shadow the hedgehog voiceline
GUESS CORRECTLY CHAT, AND MY FORTUNE IS YOURS, FOR THE TAKING
I still got 300K, so it's whatever Kappa
@blacktiger51 i appreciate the gesture but i must redeem my own shadow the hedgehog voice line lest i be forever disappointed in mine self
fuck i was just about to say would you do it again
I'd kill a man for a single corn chip
i would kill a man for a nice, delicious bowl of fried rice right now
@tarttapple That means you are going to try and kill me then?
Because I just made and ate a bowl of fried rice
hey i didn't mean anyone in chat would be witness let alone victim to the atrocities i would perform for a bowl of fried rice-
i guess i'm gonna have to kill you
tart, you hold down rgamer, and we'll beat them up and take the fried rice
Damn must be some good fried rice lmao
real gamer strats are so in
@Iceblue I want in for the rice
It's lap cheung sausage fried rice with sambal fried into the rice for extra heat and two eggs in it
I also use lard as the frying oil
hope rgamer cooked enough fried rice for us to steal
Lard is way more flavorable than neutral oil
I also cook the sausage with the rice as it steams
And yeah I use chicken powder which is MSG in the rice water as it cooks
i ran out of bacon and sausage :(
What are you having for dinner Phantom?
If you wanna be extra fancy cook it with some garlic in the water too
i just made some bread on sea of stars
Green onion in the fried rice too
Whites with frying, green part as garnish
8-cap and 3-cap in one ch8 jr fight is incredibly funny
does this shop count as ch 8?
i can finally stop playing sea of stars for the night
well you see its pass midnight and my Bedge is looking pretty good
and since i made it pass a good part i can stop playing
whenever i find a save point that is KEKW
i wasn't gonna pay out until you found it anyway
next item so i can go to Bedge KEKW
damn i want to get back on sea of stars
i dont mind this check along as i have a way to deal with it
that happened too many times to me smilers
always 1 to 3 star points off
and check them out, LIVE, on Twitch.tv
Twitter can rot in Hell, where it belongs
Multiworld! Enjoy. Game night, so I can't stay.
How are you feeling btw? Everything working right?
Alrightie, just making sure you're okay. If you need anything let us know. oranLove
That's like playing hunnipop for the plot
how do you know what you send over like with the gift box?
I have a usb N64 controller just for this lol
i hate moving. expecally during summer
He isn't a partner.  He is a curse.
Hope u had a great fathers day weekend to all and a great day for everyone. As this was my 1st one without mine Hope you had a good phone conversation with urs. GL on runs as well.
Oh no u and ur dad arent best friends. Ok then.
At least did u enjoy How to train your dragon?
The only heinous act disney ever did to me personally was have and hire bob paycheck (chapek) as ceo. He embodied nothing and OF the SPIRIT of disney. That intune pushed his lesbian fetishness and fantasies to the pixar and marvel dept. But wont say anymore due to this being a gaming time. #TeamLuigiMarioFusion.

Is your controller properly mapped to the analog stick?
You can do both analog and d-pad
That's what I do if I struggle with the notched hammer angle
Let this magic make your BP costs be reasonable! mikeyl19MagicRod
It was good! Migraine starting to kick in, but I was able to finish a couple of games in the multiworld I'm currently involved with before that. Both FF6 and Lufia 2 Ancient Cave down~
Eh, it happens, sadly. Chronic pain be chronic.
It's been a minute, though! Sorry I've been gone. My MP tends to be a bit more spent these days. ^^;
I'll go ahead and lurk now, though. Cheering you on from the lurk corner!
are you in ACAB jail again
wanna see what I was workin on today then while you wait?
they're shelves I'm gonna put on my walls 'v'
leftover lasagna dinner is done it is true to wait the 1 day.
it died as soon as I sent over the pic lmao
in this, the month of pride
I was depressed eating after finishing Farewell
we love cheap af Mega Quake
I never do AP Pape glitchless lol
Cheating is okay if you have fun doing it its ok LUL
You don't have Star Stone anyway
At least nice to know you don't have to double dip Palace
Man... what do I do with my life now that Celeste is officially beaten (I have mods to play still on it but) o|-<
I guess I could start Hollow Knight
128 hours on that one save file
I love how the checks for other worlds are gift boxes
Aw man 😔 I think it's cute
I want to put a buttplug up my nose to see how it feels when it's too big
it really said uno reverse motherfucker
GL with the multi world everyone! phanto274Lurk
Mr Phantom how many worlds is AP?
As someone who plays it yup, feels like losing pity sim
Ok. So like 3 per letter
You can load the previous room?
This def turned out to be quite the gauntlet but yet very funnzies
I'll show you something fertile alright
any ice king color pallette is just so dope!
Can I borrow the kokiri sword to put butter in my toast
I see. Do you have the internal resolution set to 240p? It looks really sharp and pixelated. I kinda like it
you couldn't flash it on to a blank cart and run it on original console ?
zfg does that for his rom-hacks and such
How do I install internet on my N64? Anyone got a 56K Modem? Kappa
I'm using the Lunar Fork but I haven't tried Paper Mario in years on my PC
I don't think I've ever met a single Windows user who likes using Windows
Oh shit I got auto update on
windows 7 was peak of all peaks
Ehh whatever all I mostly play is TF2
"Even though code for our operating systems will probably get more and more complex as time goes on we do not need testing I swear please buy Windows" - Microsoft
Ngl Peach looks pretty in that dress
Reminds me of Shadow Queen Peach
Xbox Series X was so promising when ur first released and then Microsoft just kinda lost interest in being a genuine game console
I'm only on win10 because I literally started to be unable to play games on Win 8
and now I'm looking at end of the line with disgust cause most of my drivers will not make it I fear
@fatpidgeybirb damn you might have to buy a new PC man
@GreenStacheProductions I just upgraded my pc, the problem is in hardware like my drawing tablet

Wait there's an update to the rando?
good, and good luck with the rando!
thanks for entertaining us with your paper mario randos!!!
The streamer who raided you has debilitating hair loss and needs to wear a wig. GL on your runs!
barbDumper barbHyperdumper barbHondump barbKrumper barbMakeitsussy barbDonk barbBumper
@Mitchflowerpower why were you banning random people?????????
ya I still watch the randos on youtube of papes mario
Oh GOD loading zones random too??
Those were some strangely connected rooms HUHH
Are the rewards random for Poe's?
so lock in for a 8 hour seed HOLD
Well, at least it's relatively early over there, right?
so daybreak 3 got delay today cuz switch 2 version... on a game key card Deadge
George of Hyrule, WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!
oh the same one thats been around for like the last year?
Yeti custom ordered it using Link's courier service
oh i got the plat for sea of stars
there a in game tracking for them
you need to turn in 27 for it
good luck with rando, im gonna hop on the kilios async. Need to do more of wind waker. Risch is in that group too
That was way smoother than it should have been lol. Does rando change goats?
How far did my fart get
Questions we shall never have the answer for
she can't there is a bar
there's 100 rupees just waiting in the ice cave :)
region, i think so kakariko but not to gorons
Can Epona not kill enemies by ramming them enough?
Or do they just not drop money?
Can you not get the chest in Link's basement? Or is that Lantern locked?
beehive tree has 15/20 in the upper branchesIIRC
Can you get Honey from the beehive since you have Bottle?
Larvae, that's what I meant. Sorry
Oh you need the fishing rod... Forgot
Can you sell at all in this game? Been too long
Wait... is the grass contents rando?
Oh OK phew I thought it was dumb for a second
Grass rando is kind of a meme in ALTTPR
Grass rando seems ridiculous to me
They're indeed being punished by rupee spawns
Uh that's a lot of rupees
there's no other checks you can do to maybe get a silver rupee or somethin???
sounds like a save buy and reset YEP
i was just typing it KEKW
pretty sure that was already there when you bought the poe soul you didn't need to leave/reenter ig that's new???
Yeah it was there when it got purchased
so what's new in in the rando besides being locked by capitalism?
well I meant what's in the new version lmao
Just seems odd the seed would make you farm rupees like this before letting you do *anything*
no money from repeats of goats/sumo? If that's even a thing
You did it once right? So, maybe?
not even paid for labor PoroSad
Can't believe he won't pay you for literally 30 seconds of work
"wtf, you want me to pay you for 32 seconds of labor!? gtfo"
ooh baby a whole blue rupee!
None of the other rocks drop rupees?
this is where I need to jump in with my sound board and play the spongebob "2 hours later" LUL
Sounds like this rando needs some rupee logic
Welp, I'm hungry, so I'm gonna go get some food. Be back in a bite
In ALTTPR I do the archery mini-game or farm bluepees from a few different areas
Archery is in the dark world though so it's not always available, mostly if you're doing inverted or entrance rando
Might be quicker to just use Link going in and out of that area to constantly reload that blupee
I was about to say it might be easier to just spin slash the grass then I remembered you don't have a sword NotLikeThis
never been so hype for 10 rupees
it went on the top ledge next to the tree
Good thing we're not playing one bonk KO
so what if there is rupee logic, and it just assumes these trees
i roughly calculated my time loss on my sob in any% earlier today, i lose about 15m after MDH OMEGALUL
before MDH it's only about 7, i expected more
Glad I only got cereal and made it back to see that lol
Legendary gamer. Can you believe how hard they held forward?
And that's how @PhantomGamesBot got cancelled
we can play... the video game
not bad for a casual run
but its req for logic Kappa
well unless there's something important item in the area of AG you skip then you'll need it :P
"If you can cheat hard enough, you only need 2"
Too bad Boots can't cut grass
how goes the run? also thx for the sub whoever gifted it to me when they gifted it
@fangzila You can check your notifications to see who gifted you
thx LordOfDuh thanks for saving me from my history of scuffed ad hell
i say ad hell cause i would always get broken twitch ads
What you need is a Sword? phanto274Smile
Bugs oh bugs where are you
If you buy PoT small key from bombshop, what replaces it?
rolling with iron boots can't break anything can it?
Can't turn it in rn I think
i always did love how they used serenade of water there lmao
time to go back to they crypto I mean rupee farm back home?
did you just tax that goron
look it's better than every other rando where you get taxed :P
"here let me pay 100 rupees to see what this is aaaand it's a blupee"
well that could be a sword
A sword would let you farm grass a bit easier without Epona
Back to the top you go lol
Yup. Was hoping for the key one lol
@gyroguy123 as was i. i got it earlier lmao
There's one more Goron merchant, isn't there?
In the main street, I think?
There's a big one I thought
Gonna go grab some more food
Well now you have the catch screen image to use for the thumbnail
This room bonking into the tree for rupees
yeah this room with a yellow rupee out of reach lmao
you know when i said lock in for a 8 hour seed i didn't mean farming money for 8 hours Deadge
Needs a new command I hate Malo
This really IS a capitalism seed. God DAMN
on the bright side you know where it is
game taking a ruPISS on you
All just for you to awoo phanto274Howl
I mean yeah but that's the only thing we know that claw is doing at the moment
TP Randomizer or How Link gets CTE from his get rich quick scheme of rolling into trees for rupees.
Meaning the winner of this seed would be the one who just is stubborn enough to grind money the slow way
time to give link brain damage
yeah too bad you're the one playing it or else it'd make for a great "play my rando" submission :D
1300 rupees in order to play the seed
1300 is a steal.  Should of been more imo
nah cause there's also a GM key for 210 rupees
and then a sky character for 40
oh and also the gate key you bought how much was that?
Now you just have to wonder.  Which squirell bank are you robbing blind.
And they talked about stealing things so I assume they just stole the rupees
so I think 1520 rupees required plus another 280 for ones that could have been required but were dead checks.
its not like the runs getting any shorter
Are there bonkable trees in the village itself?
These are more condensed anyways, I guess
The Legend of Zelda: Capitalist Princess
Mr Phantom you are phantom but I never see you play the Zelda games with phantoms
Dunno if there's a gender neutral term
well you need at least 210 more but yeah hopefully you'll get them through doing checks lmao.
Finally the seed begins after 2 hours and 30 minutes of rupee grinding
You can do the game with one Clawshot, right?
And more than 1 attack power
I meant the game in town
The one you tried to do without it
but how many rupees are required to walk that path?
I love playing rando for 2 hours without any good items or direction :))))
Mother 3 on 3? Is that the Earthbound / NBA crossover?
Could've gotten that prior to the ordon tree bonking OpieOP
Aight, I'm back. Any pog items aside from Clawshot?
It's so funny how clawshot alone opens up a big chunk of the game
Nearly the whole game is designed around it
They just wanna be your friends though!
altho ig its still kinda nice
Maybe that can be our sord or lantern
I mean it has to go somewhere at night
First bug was wallet, second was blupee
or it could be one of the 4 poe souls lmao
that woulda been useful like half an hour ago
well there's still the Goron Mines key you didn't buy right? or did I miss that?
0 for 3 on useful bugs lol
You can do Song Songs now, right?
man being able to change time of day is so nice
It was Malo Mart the seed
This seed brought to you by Malo Mart
are there any other checks left that require money?
well I meant like that you haven't seen yet yeah
The audio crackling from the howls KEKW
GL its chore time so gonna lurk
I pb'd by over 20 minutes so that was cool
is this randomized dungeon etries btw?
In other words we only just started to play the game for like 25 minutes
if you leave does it take you back to GM or LH?
Just get 60 poe souls and you can get one :P
You can get 60 souls for one haha
In a game with 9 dungeons
gtg eat, glhf with the rando
maybe all 4 other small keys are locked in AG and the 60 poe souls is actually required Kappa
i thought that was a vanilla thing LUL
Buggies, maybe this time it's a sord or a lantern
Well ig that technically means 1 less dead bug check LUL
All the money was locked behind the money requirements lol
Ok. I have an idea. What if progression items showed up on the mini map like the tears of light
What don't you know about it?
so is "almost everything" just "allsanity but i still hate PoT"
can you get to forest temple entrance?
you got iron boots before clawshot technically but I don't think that opened up any checks on its own.
are you gonna any% your way in?
Well you might not need it
Over 3 hours in and no sword yet
Almost 1300 rupees just to get it KEKW
well one sword is on Agitha but gotta find the bug for it...
Back and were doing a swordless run
Contribute your rupees to an IRA
Invest back into the squirrel bank
You invest the rupees with me. I'll aim for a 3% return by selecting non-hyrule government bonds and companies who had consistent earnings
Are you open to additional risk?
Than historically 7-12 returns are average
We'll invest more heavily into growth stocks and Hyrule debt bonds
How about some hyrule war bonds.  They always seem to be at war.
oh hey I'm back to 100k I can waste it all on a 2nd VIP!
Or do a plando.  A plando where every item is vanilla
Ok so I would suggest a 50-35-15 split.
@Penguin_Cuddles TP Plando every single progression item is locked behind spending money
Invest into goron spring bathwater today.
Hyrule government kinda unstable and that leads to economic predictability
oh actually better plando idea, every progression item is locked behind spending rupees, then every check they unlock is rupees :D
i am laughing so hard banging on my floor right now
Is horse call ever required in a legit playthrough?
A part of me was hoping it would be master sword lol
May the odds ever be in your favor
it'd be funny if you needed horse call to get Epona for when you fight Ganon on horseback LUL
But why would you ignore girlfriend #1
Wow that was a cool warp
Link had to bonk too to have empathy for the boar
Phantom if you're gonna kill all the bokoblins without them seeing a thing at least let them say goodbye first
did you do the clawshot mini game?
monkaS She is in possession of a lot of would
If you had a hedgehog what would you name it as a pet?
How much money does this little girl have!?
@gyroguy123 I mean she IS a princess
3 bomb checks in here so far lol
Too bad you don't got a sword to slice with lol
does it do damage if you don't have a sword?
Hey, sorry I missed you on Sunday. Had family over for Father's day
this was certainly a filthy rich seed
And so many bombs it makes the moab jealous
You could donate to the church of Ganontology
You gonna bonk all the trees once for old time's sake? LUL
Idk why you would ever buy a shield because if you just buy more arrows and have better aim you never need the shield and that's a fact
I will not be taking any questions at this time
Link just casually has a man's soul in the basement he forgot about.
Damn, 4 hours in and no sword
Why would he need a sword?
If you have enough arrows and good enough aim you never need a sword and that's a fact
I will not be taking any questions at this time
I was almost worried you didn't have any
PTSD from the beginning of the seed has made Phantom pick up every rupee he finds LUL
Oh right, that's a thing you're supposed to do... I forgot...
welcome raiders to tp rando madness
We were doing Elden ring rando so we wanted to continue the rando train
Breaking into Arbiter's entrance are we?
Ah yes, the real Rocket Link
ok, I am curious how this works- does clearing AG in forest and leaving through the boss room put you at the top of the temple? I suppose i shall find out soon.
That was probably the most fitting one
it'd be funny tho if AG exit led to another dungeon.
Soooo, 2 dungeons with their own boss keys
that zora armor is so super swag!
Finally the first dungeon we can do
I was talking about the chest XD
I think we should get some more rupees
I had a friend and high school who never finished TP because she was too scared of this fight
Now is it AD or find 3 Mirror Shards?
Half of which was rupee grinding simulator
Also Agitha, you are the most out-of-place fighter in Hyrule Warriors
almost halfway to an AG key
i cant get enough of this tunic can u make it a pre stream background the purp just kix a$$
It's not a bad shade of Purple, gotta agree
@CaptainMD13 its like hes ready for Mortal Kombat to replace King Rain.
well you know where one key shard is at least
Florida the b2b Cup champs the TB rivalry is now matched. Waht dynamite on the panhandle.
also glad to see my fave room
@stavros12c34anenoglou who won the Conn Smythe?
hey phantom! gl with the run
Holy balls it’s a Phantom stream
Almost 7 hours is wild lol
Also I’m pissed Florida took the cup Madge
*looks at palace* immediately leaves that’s so based lmao
i was kinda rooting for both teams bc Marchand helped my bruins all those yrs and Perry was always my duck fave that deserved another
Don’t cheer for Marchand he’s a rat
I love how she moves her head around and there’s no hair that moves lmao
Yep Water goron the Zorron or Gorra Hybrid
I didn’t even know it was possible to have almost 4K in rupees that’s wild
Okay I was about to say
Don’t talk to my boy like that smh
So you race the faster yeti
you ain't got time for that
Watch the Poe guy give you the clawshot after you collect all the souls
Ohh crap you didn’t check the oocoo store either
I’m heading to Bedge but good luck killing Ganon with all your random items
Did my stream just crash on vannilla shot?
i was just kidding about the 8 hours thing bawkPanic
You see, this is why I turn minigames off for randos LOL
ur a madlad 8 hours hot damn pog
usually how runs end up taking forever
arent there settings to add extra ones incase or not for this
@Libont twin item settings is a cop out and not fun.
so is twin setting all items cuz if u can take out most items
the game has answered ur prayers
triple decker bacon and egg on bagel or croissant.
top 10 stream over. What a glorious time.
So whats fastest if you get in a slap fight for 10 slaps? HypeFire
Was just making a joke at those terrible rng odds two runs in a row
Come on Hugo.  Once or twice is funny.  We want to see the run vampir7Itsfine
So if tp continues to be butt.  What else is on the docket?
What 2? We could make a poll to gauge interst.
I mean...I have pizza and vibes so LuvSign
Different can be good.  It's how I found you.  I stuck a chance on pape rando.
I'm excited once things get broken and you can do the randos for like windwaker on newer hardware.
The hardware mods to get around the first switch protections was a thing.  People are already getting bricked for trying the software stuff
In most cases it's not worth it.
So is this one of the few categories where running it in English doesn't matter?
Neat.  I'm so used to not being able to understand the game since it's in Japanese 😅
I'm not saying this game just in general
It's like the mario and Luigi games.  They came out in NA first before even being sent to Japan or Europe
Minish cap is still one of my favorite games. If the kinstones were not trash
The super paper mario speedrun I was watching the other day was WR at something crazy like 11 hours.
Half the speedrun is just inventory management to store things for cooking in the last 10 min of the run
19/20...guess we're cooking this one HypeFire
Guess we're cooking this one too vampir7Itsfine
I put on my 3D glasses but the game isn't 3Ding
this reminds me I wanna try online gameshare just to know what it's like
ngl, thought you raided someone for second
@SeventyFourTG had a dream you and me ran co-op Tears of the Kingdom
@buff00n Let's do this even though TotK co-op does not exist
Keep hearing people talk about how quiet the new pro controller is
I went garage saleing in 90 degree weather today
At least I still have my copy of Diddy Kong Racing DS
closest thing I did to garage sale hunting was getting Kirby: Canvas Curse in Indiana
@buff00n One of my cousins is a really hardcore garage sale hunter
he found a copy of Earthbound at a garage sale one time
wait, you said "cat", my bad
Well. I attempted the cream root beer
It seemed correct and it reminded me of it. I can't tell if it's the consistency/ratio I used or something, but it just made me appreciate how good the root beer is on its own LUL
found an AP client for SRB2 lol
I feel like AP Yoshi's Island would drive me insane
cannot believe they didn't add Daisy
where's my BIG ASS PRINCESS DAISY
Hey we were gonna go out to eat, when do you think you'd be down?
I've been up since 9am LOL
So now the true debate. Do I attempt to make a sundae to distract myself from mediocre root beer, or do I wait in case it also sucks
Gonna go watch the Kids Choice Awards
the double dash thread is awful. Dev mentions pushing out an update this week. Some asks if it be done before they start an AP on thursday. Dev says they are kinda aiming for friday then someone else chimes in with "what time on friday?" They are insufferable.
I posted "Reminds me of the old anime fansub days of the 2010 era "Itll be done when its done" lmao" KEKW
All I can say animewise is that GuuuuuuX is now finished and I rate it a pretty good watch if you're into Universal Century What-ifs
Today here is 101 degrees F
it's unreal how much you can lose on this split just to rng
i need to practice goats more tbh
but im busy doing spinner segment practice and raging at moldorms instead
yeah i feel like i should go for fast bit but idk
it's just a nice offset to if the game fucks you
and if you have an oem d pad like me, doing the consistent method still sucks sometimes
it's not annoying enough to make me switch
idk it might be I don't really watch any colo streamers
I could ask in the discord it's from
doesn't seem like it's on 7TV
I started tidying up the crawlspace last night
it's a more convenient location for getting to / from work
my grandma REALLY wanted me to go back home, for whatever reason
nvm that she liked having me over
how big is the Shovel Knight? I recall the X figure being humongous
my biggest concern is if I could fit either of them on a shelf
this thing is NOT the goat
if you find a buyer for either of 'em, go for it
otherwise, hit me up and we'll go from there
See, I am not a wind waker speedrunner... Therefore does that make me not poor?
Ok I want a refund then
Simply buy windwaker 10 years ago to avoid being poor
I'm so damn lucky I bought that 10 years ago lol
I had no idea it was on wii
it was on wii first iirc right?
I ALSO DIDN'T KNOW WII COULD PLAY GC GAMES LOL
Look. Swift has many talents, but knowing every release of every Zelda game is not one of them
I bought an entire gc cause of that
Which now I use for speedrunning so yay?
Hey did you know that BOTW came out on Wii U?
I remember getting the Wii version from GameStop cuz they got my mum with that "You'll save $5 if you buy it used!"
I still don't have the GC version
To be fair Swift, Gamecubes are pretty great
@Zeliversal They rule, I love mine
did you know that the goats were nerfed in the wii version?
jk I'm just making shit up at this point now LUL
Yeah that's like the main advantage of the Wii for GC is Wii component cables are EZ
Fun fact I bought the capture card I did specifically because it had component input so I could stream both my Wii that I bought cables for and my new Switch... And then I proceeded to never speedrun again YEP
you almost made the mayor hit his head on the stairs
Bo is the first on a list of worst parts
@Zeliversal I streamed, hit affiliate then basically never streamed again
You see once and you immediately copy and implement
But I was attached to this run
Have you considered asking for help from tas
@Swiftalu me in KH3 data fights on all pro codes rn tippiLurk
just count which frame you're on obv...
@Swiftalu what KEKW data Xebraman in KH3 fuckin suuuuuucks to learn KEKW
You know I responded to that but I don't know anything about kh3 ikesLost
silly laserdome actually being gameplay is cool - his combos being completely shuffled after the first isnt papeHands
if you have seen ANY KH2 data org speedruns like ever - its that but harsher
Omg it's really like skyward sword!11!11!1
don't you just hate it when devs add their fancy shamcy effects that are cool and pretty just to make speedrunning 100x more annoying? :(
cus Kh3 pro codes say "oh fancy combos? naaah, you got your massive key, thats it"
@Jonxhas I know kh2 runners but have never sat down to watch a run
tippiGiggle dont worry, I wont swift
Don't worry tho I know ss and tp tho :)
I rly forgot I put tho in the sentence already lol
I finished it, I got really frustrated at the end 🥴
still sad though that the TWEWY cast they brought into Dream Drop so far hasnt shown themself again in KH
Skyward Sword is... a game... ig...???
ss at 120fps on switch 2 pauseBedge
But tho swift if tho you forgot tho then tho you could still add tho tho
@Jonxhas You know what's funny, I HAVE played twewy, and neo twewy
OG TWEWY is the most fun game.
I could test this by running twewy on the switch 2....
and my gremlin dummy brain having not played either FF or TWEWY be like "oh cool characters yo"
I have 75 hours in mario kart :)
if I got this right though: TWEWY is ddr more or less, yea?
She's been chatting in Mario Kart streams YEP
I did watch you play it a bit here'n there swift, but never did myself
i have 0 mins in the new mario kart phanto274Smile
@Jonxhas It's a very hard to explain game but basically you play as 2 people at once.
@Jonxhas It's such a sick run, held back by the fact joycons with turbo and good motion controls don't exist
I have zero minutes in Mario Kart. Period
@Darkness3827 that much I gathered from just how KH Dream Drop is showing them
Like I have never had problems with mashing in games but that one hurts my hands
@Swiftalu yea so uhhh KH3 data fights basically turn alerady hard fights into bullet hell-like encounters give / take. there's a reason ppl GOOD at KH got hours long runs on data org crit lv1 pro codes KEKW
Pokemon never gives me this problem
at least thats all I can find on youtube time-wise for somewhat flawless fighting of the 13 bosses
and my dumbass being not close to that level is trying to do the same cus "why the fuck not"
+ there being an achievement for doing x amount of pro code shit and I want as many as I can get at this point
I could already make the game easier again, but choose to be an idiot basically
Streamer the video game only does what it's told to do
@Jonxhas You use the stylus to move Neku around and do your abilities and then you use the d-pad to do attacks for your partner (they move on their own) and each one exists on their own screen. It's a really cool game conceptually. Particularly the OG one. The newer ones since they weren't on any dual screen hardware kinda got rid of that gimmick and you just switch between the characters basically.
@Darkness3827 yea ok, so I paid enough attention watchin swift to know its a mix of 2 styles of control in the OG
but at once, more indepth to say, starfox command by a MILE of course
Final remix I need to use 2 joycons and control them seperately, at the same time
@Swiftalu laserswords but joycons go brrrrrr
except the fact I hear mashing atop => ewww
That's why the motion controls are dummy important, cause cursor motion controls
Any turbo joycons just have lag for motion controls sadly
@Swiftalu actually surprised that they get held back that much by such a little switch tippiThink
But that's also why I could just test switch 2 lol
@Jonxhas Might be a 3rd party moment, joycons aren't exactly as popular to make 3rd party of compared to procon
@Swiftalu not surprised, given how flimsy they were so far and how easily they'd break
not to mention nintendo SURELY did not want others having access to the schematics to confirm / deny stick drift being partially by design KEKW
HahaSweat My ass never broke them aside from the obvious wow they drifted moment
as per "look, shitty sticks be shitty"
I saw they made it a lot harder to repair the switch 2 joycons which I'm not particularly happy about when they still have the part that causes drift
@Swiftalu aka the stick box you mean? KEKW
I use joycons all the time, they are my go to
I just feel more comfy using them lol
ifixit has a video on takin them apart
and the title says "new joycons, same problem" soooo KEKW
Hey my procon doesn't have drift at least! :)
How do you go fast in Mario kart without drift?
That's Pokemon Snap Back Switch 2 edition YEP
Yea I kinda wanted to look at putting in the part down the line that replaces with stickbox with something else that is less likely to drift
there's not even an IF there
my dumbass brain having a sentence in there too KEKW
my right trigger spring broke more then once in my ps5 controllers phanto274Smile
they essentially have no proper neutral
can't start drifting if you already are :P
and you know what the proper fix for stick drift is?
as in better stick housing, but same baseline mechanism
fuck doing it resistor based via potentiometers
Still got my rock candy 360 controller
Y'all wanna drift. Y'all wanna go fast. But you don't want drift. Y'all want automation, but don't want controller doing things automatically
Well it's this 3rd party, it was cheap as hell but man I love it lol
Shame they don't really make much anymore ):
I disagree there, but ONLY for the fact XBOne onwards the controllers actually fit my fuckoff hands KEKW
It's got colored clear plastic so you can see the inside which is so sick
never owned an xbone so I can't really say much about em
@Darkness3827 all I know? they're okay to take apart IF they are first party
3rd party, you're stuck between 10 different board designs which in turn make taking controllers apart shitty
sorry, nerdge me is hating getting stuck in Xemnas' DM every 4 seconds rn KEKW
I'm here for the panels too
I should really play kh more
gonna guess for you its still pitch black?
@Swiftalu dont feed into the pro code stuff though KEKW
literally the stupidest way to play KH3 main story
cus damage calcs in KH3 are STUPID
I've never played a KH game.
they only work well for pro codes on DLC stuff
main game, with pro codes you're essentially dealing chippies a LOT
I played the first one, and also re:chain of memories
I finished 1 story in that game
Just need to do the other
I am a sonic blade stan in Re:CoM KEKW
That's better but see I hate aiming
literally got a deck made during my 100% journal savefile playthrough where I think I had like 20 sonic blades in there KEKW
Re:CoM you dont have to aim
you just spam sonic blade, it homes in KEKW
It still felt like I missed half the time using it
thats more the games fault rly
sometimes it loves to just fly past
omg goats did what they're supposed too!?!?!?!??!?
normal CoM I loved using triple clouds a lot, which kinda doesnt really work anymore in Re:CoM
like - CoM Omniblade Cloud just wrecks the screen KEKW
Never played WoFF it looked interesting tho
Still have yet to play an ff game
Persona is like pokemon if you think about it
actually I would recommend Bravely over FF personally
but thats cus Bravely 1 hooked me BIG with airy KEKW
i was gonna buy it was 12 bucks but my back log is too big
hope everything is all well with you phantom
the new paper Mario rando? it looks like so much fun
Bravely Default 1 and 2 are super fun imo tippiTap
@Jonxhas never played 1 or Second, but played 2 and it's legit one of my fave games ever. It's like a modern FFV and FFV is also one of my fave games ever.
black tiger and I thought the same thing. 😂
@Darkness3827 1 is great too - the only dumb thing 1 has going for it is a 3ds-tied feature related to streetpass
though I reckon that can be remedied easily
I just took the link from the discord and pasted it.
@Jonxhas Well I assume that's not an issue on the remaster so I'd prolly just get that if/when I get a Switch 2.
@Darkness3827 I mean I reckon the feature might still be present somewhat
but different in how it works
Hope u been good and looks like solid start.
HOLD is it time for a oot rando
this puzzle made 0 sense to me when playing casually lmao
not me as a kid taking an hour to figure out that puzzle.
@Darkness3827 every zelda needs the lost woods pattern in ww it was light trials in links awakening its the egg. Here MasterK
need TP Rando to randomize the starting position for that puzzle :)
yeah I knew that I just figured it'd make you do the puzzle as well cause I've never tried that setting yeah.
How quick and fast were ur Twitch updates? Mine was like 4 days behind9late)
I mean straight line speed maybe, but the agility I wanna know. there's no shot something that big can change directions that fast.
Epona is aied to be a 10 yr old like they unfortunately did for Link in Echoes
Link pls learn to climb vines faster
wowe 2 jump ook is nive
can't ending blow it in the butt?
Oh. I forgor, did I tell you about the results of homemade sundaes?
I know I told you about the rootbeer
Even without hearing the topping, it's fairly cracked. I think the best thing is more like I can correct the ratio myself. Like if there's too much fudge I can always just go get another small scoop
Why are you focusing just because something needs undivided attention??
yo that was sick I think that's the first time I've seen that.
yeah that was unfortunate but I meant phase 2 yeah
ok I am mad at myself now.... out of all the health Xemnas had left, half a bar was remaining and I literally would have had to catch him only ONE more time papeHands
worst trick in the run number like 7 strikes :(
We need to put runs in medically induced comas to prevent their death
so what does going to the other save and howling at the stone actually accomplish?
Link just learn to climb fast and it'll only lose like 10 seconds :(
but link wanted to jump attack the air, dont you see tippiGiggle
go slower? idfk lmao that was bizarre...
got a time im content with for now on spinner segment, gonna do hyrule now phanto274Nodders
could have saved a bit more but i messed up moving in deathsword fight at the end
triple stalfos skip is super free with the c up method imo
@morpheus080 im outta twitch lock (bad update delay) Hope everything is great and that was a funnzie race hope u do it again. Hows everything been?
pretty good stavros, been doing some tp practice as of late
i need to practice enter snowpeak, my gold is like a minute slow for some reason
idk how much messenger skip saves but surely not a minute
whenever you go up the stairs and roll off in the first room I always think you are trying to go upstairs and messed up LUL
I for one am glad u 2 decided to join the tp side!!!!
@stavros12c34anenoglou the game is cool and so are the peeps that run it WICKED
now we must look into eyes of yeto
Darn It was a good go
ooh all that memory to look at
can you make macros in this
oh so randomize what room you're in?
monkaW so do it before you fight ice king
ah so not a random room? that'd be funny would also prolly break logic lmao...
are there escape specific entrances? I'd assume not
and then going back up apparently lmao
I forgot about that one too lmao.
i think that after warehouse key skip
what happens if you're on the other side of the blue doors when the red doors are active or vice versa? I would assume it doesn't matter but idk???
what if you're in the other room tho I meant
and try to go back into the main room
why the hell is everything round on Twitch
is it national round day or something
well wouldn't they all be problematic if the room is flooded currently?
ig yeah that's be necessary if you homeward shroomed with it flooded in regular rando.
you might want a way to reset homeward shroom location just in case something bad happens that you missed.
homeward shroom making you game over would be funny tho LUL
Are there any problematic prologue ones? Idk how you'd trigger them
this battle music is great i need to play octopath 2
Oh yeah! Lets rock it with Tp styling.
my ac got delivered today FeelsOkayMan
it said july 3th to july 10th
so this is a little early YEP
I think all dungeons should be required to do all of the dungeon
100% of the dungeon for all dungeons
I said optionally we could do "All of Dungeons" where you're allowed to skip any dungeons but if you go in the dungeon you have to 100% it
But everything else is any% rules
Sadge cant get ball and chain and leave
idk that seems like a solid category to me
Like, it's "All Dungeons" not "Minimal of all dungeons"
But I accept "All of minimal dungeons"
Except you can also skip overworld stuff :)
And if people wanna do "All All Dungeons"
So the market beat me up today and stole my lunch money Sadge
Maybe I can make it back on Monday
the fact people can get 7:1x boots times is still crazy to me
i can say i successfully avoided getting hung over from last night
i took so many shots OMEGALUL
i think i'm just resigned to not continue if it's not 1st try tbh
literally can't care about the run anymore
i have like 1m20s on eldin vessel but i pretty much need GV and RR to not suck
so continuing with a shitty intro doesn't feel worth idk
i dont mind losing that time to gorge void tbh, but on top of ems and s&s skip, it just sucks
cause there was a rupee on the ground
wolf JAs are shorter if there's an item on the ground, it's weird
idk, I learned it from beest
although i usually b attack him there
whats your favorite split in AD?
I heard "Bo" and I was like no way
im a big domrod fan tbh even with the bullshit
forest temple is so fun in wii hundo
AD less so cause we split it and come back with claw
yeah, saving the monkeys is great but it's slow
that's right, 1 trip lakebed and then white midna glitch WICKED
it's convenient on wii where you can midna dive directly after beating boss bug, and then even though we have to get the tear after, we save some time back by warping to CT instead of dashing
obliterating diababa with BA is great
im pretty sure it's not worth it but i should probably do some more involved bomb timings
the bombs are good for chandelier skip in AG, BA fan tower, and then tot of course. the armos in ToT have bullshit hitboxes on na1.0, so you waste bombs sometimes
I almost have 15k channel points it’s a good day
gl gl on the twoiloight princess tippiFlower
I swear I collect slower than you
@Midnaliin isnt that kinda lowish for a 5 monther?
No I don’t have it on mobile Sadge
It’s so hot in my apartment I’ve been dying NotLikeThis
@Midnaliin My own heatwave here stopped yesterday for my bday! I was actually happy and smiling at the sky!
I just ordered an AC unit cuz the windows aren’t helping anymore
I don’t even have a fan cuz I’m a dumbass
this fuckin gate that i hate
I believe in the first try LETSGO
I still believe in the PB
Just gold everything it’s easy Kappa
Time for the LOCKIN5800 but will be back after bikin.
Nahh the laundry is trolling me. sent me a notification saying it was finished there’s 8 mins left on it
Somehow I always fluctuate time loss there by like 8 seconds lol
Yeah sometimes I get stuck under the bridge in ZD lmao
dummy question: out of Saix, Marluxia, Riku Replica, who? no context needed, just pick a name PrideFlower
Do you know the iron boots method for waterfall sidehop?
technically there's also still a ???, Master Xehanort and Xion, though the 2 named ones unlock after the three I mentioned, and ??? after all of them 😅
KH3s data fights go wild and while I dont NEED to do the pro codes thing anymore, actually learning them feels smarter with them on now that I have done like 8 of them all KEKW
whats also wild is that I wouldnt even gain much in not doing pro codes damage-wise cus of how stupid KH damage calcs go
like - think "oh yea a lv5 pikachu can just deal with a lv100 mewtwo cus game said so" stupid
damage floors and ceilings (same for defense for you) are painful
like - as an example with KH2: rando has a setting to disable those floor / ceiling mechanics. specifically ceilings. once your stats actually matter, shit just MELTS KEKW
and KH3 is no different there, but I aint modding it for this specific bit
basically a system which HELPS for LV1 runs, but fucks up lategame - kinda similar ish to damage caps in JRPGs
the ONLY reason it even matters is because they implemented EXPZero skills to negate exp gain
yep - and while it helps in challenge runs to negate full on chip damage style endurance tests
it definitely fucks me over rn cus pro codes essentially turn me into "semi-lv1"
semi cus you could still farm stats and I KNOW I farmed too many while grinding max level
Phantom should I be responsible tonight or go gambling PauseChamp
I have one an hour away I’m so tempted
Like spend 20-30 bucks on roulette so nothing serious KEKW
I never do the irl ones cuz the electronic ones are like 5-10 a hand
Just be the gold you want to see
I've heard that time loss is the tp experience
Keep going you’re my cleaning background noise rn KEKW
You should already be done the game Madge
No way!! can I pre-order KEKW
it's part of the setup, just go with it :P
i feel like this trick is visually representing how you feel with it not working
bashing your head into a wall lmao
How many times you played through the game?
It’s shorter and therefore less pain than AD
wake me up when you do low%
current record is about 14 hours, i can be awake for all of that
I’ve actually never heard of Adam before
done ✔️ with chores to finally answer my grin would be a mile wide for hundo
2nd is TheGuyDownstairs with 14:07:42 and 3rd is Anorakkis with 14:08:07
tgd fought back yes I was there
hugo more like you go back to the beginning of the run
Make it your estimate then lock in NODDERS
i am getting increasingly nervous about the flight ngl
the one that sounds like a sonic level
oh i've been out of and into phoenix a few times that's not the issue
i can't sleep unless i'm laying down. which was troublesome going to the UK last year
at least this one's only like 3 lol
If you get a window seat it’s easier to sleep
I’ve fully passed out in the middle seat and almost put my head on a grumpy old man beside me KEKW
i got front row business with american to get maximum leg room cause the flight back from the UK i fucked my knee up and it still hasn't recovered
oh it didn't help that the flight back from the UK the person in front of me reclined their seat early into the flight then got up and went i don't know where for the rest of it
so i was just smashed in there
and i rolled my knee when i was getting INTO the seat so i was just in pain the entire time unable to move because i was at the window with the seat in front of me reclined back and i just had to be in pain for 11 hours
which isprobably why my leg is still fucked a year later
I don’t even recline cuz I feel too bad for the person behind lol
i rerolled it getting out of the plane and had to be wheeled out in a wheelchair
if you're gonna get out of your chair at least unrecline it
that was the more egregious thing
yeah i went front row this time
can't have seats in front if i'm the front seats
i loved ur bo clip that was sent. How did he hard read all ur button presses?
also means i won't be waiting like 15 minutes for everyone to get their bags and disembark since i'll be right at the front
i don't think i ever noticed you can see midna on link's shadow lol
also i guess last run hugo was getting all the fuckery out of his system for this run lol
gate clip alone probably makes up like 2/3's of resets among people if i had to guess
it's so fast to reset, it'd be a waste of time to continue a bad one even as a beginner tbh
this has to be a nice run
HUHH I WONDER WHAT THAT IS
So when are we running this on NSO? Kappa
I think there's a good chance it'll happen
I will pay you to make midnal1Paidoff a sticker
Based on WR it’s almost an hour shorter
you don’t have to do KB1
Is Phantom about to do any% rn PauseShake
I’m dying look at discord when you have a sec KEKW
No I just sent you my oats lmao
is the game working in your favor?
I put too many servings and it overflowed as it was microwaving KEKW
I hit Nancy instead of the other spider today but the other one let me through
That and the clawshot split is terrible
gl runs, lurkin and scannin a book
yeh you've been goin a while
Should I still go gambling tonight KEKW
I keep debating with myself about it
LMAO I have to eat though I just made grilled cheese
shoutouts to passports gotta be one of my favorite documents
Hot and exhausted is all I can say
Hey hey, GL on the all dungeons
been seeing heated debates in other discords from that mod lol
some of the mods over there is doing way too much
yeah, you should only be viewing a spoiler log if you are a dev
giving a strike to the tooie player is really stupid how would they know like wtf
i see the side of "you are playing in a group that pirated a game" but the person themself did nothing wrong. Just guilty by assossication. If anything strike the person that actually did it
yeah pirated a free to play game smilers
i think the gorons made goron mines
I think forest temple was made by ook's cheeks
You didn’t tell me you were live!!
I gotta get my points smh
Oh I have that muted LMAO
@blacktiger51 you don’t need pinged you have like a million points Sadge
@Midnaliin i need 2 mil points NODDERS
I remember them saying last time I was so jealous
it was, tried tpr dungeon entrance rando
I’m actually going gambling tonight I’m excited KEKW
but having hc randomized entrance set to GM completley trivialized my entire seed. it was anentirely overworld dungeonless seed, since i iddnt need mirror shards lmao
wrestling a large man: gaming at its finest
my horse phase with ganon was bs, motherfucker would NOT stop chasing me
Morph is setting you back NOPERS
it took me a solid 5 minutes to fight ganon. Idk i think my controller is having issues i just cannot quick spin for the life of me
used to do it in like 15-20 seconds, im washed
Yeah like when you practice early platform for an hour and fall killing your 3:07 run Sadge
well, i gotta go back to my grandmas fgor the night, so good luck with the run!
I think DF got a 2:58 with 8:30 boots so it’s not a huge deal lol
@Midnaliin i hate when that happens to me
in terms of ur own performance
how good is the run so far
i think thats good to think about for this game
I believe in Phantom for the next WR NODDERS
rng doesnt become relevant until very late
but it still feels bad to lose a lot to luck peepoSad
Omg it’s a wild seventy four o7
I had another reason for changing my online name idk if you remember though
Me and Raven had the same online handles by accident
Then they started going by they/them and got rid of their old handle for obvious reasons
Okay ya girl is going to the casino. I’m a bit nervous to go out but fuck it KEKW
Me going to the casino and being pissed that they don't have voltorb flip
i think your position is almost all of it
in my eyes u stood too far right
ye i aim for a general area. i went through the positions on emu one day
didnt take that long to get an idea of what seemed the best
its kinda weird how it seems to work
standing on planks suggests it has to do with height
The answer is Nintendo and/or it's employees and/or it's subsidiaries and/or agents working on behalf of Nintendo or one of the above parties
That is what the bomb do
good news is that it isnt rng that makes u fail it
Hey! Your message is being checked by mods and has not been sent.
is this something wrong with that or should i allow it
i can't say i know much about the new dk (but it's not super relevant to me i don't plan on getting a switch 2)
u can keep going for praccy
i need to finish a run too soon
there are some super good practice vods
by beest and maybe by others too
good vids with various inputs and tips
that kinda only come with time
i just did a 4.5 hour segment review for spinner the other day
yeah, failing wbhs feels so bad
id love to see like a take from each runner
tp punishes small mistakes incredibly harshly
a lot of time to spend inside ur own head
so much of it depends on how the game decides to treat you
@Draconif double claw looks like an X therefore it goes on X
my emote is banned so i have to verbally say it
It'd be funny if Link took damage from getting hit by Yeto and it was possible to game over from that LUL
If you hit the trigger is it still possible to beat the game or are you softlocked by the story state getting messed up?
he has indeed done the thing
oh you're doing the cool thing
I actually haven't seen this trick live before
I beat this scooby "nuzlocke" after a month or so of trying
not really no, I didn't think I would beat it LMAO
he probably died to samwiches the most
he claims hell do a death compolation
his run was a 100% no sandwich, no saving, 1 life, double enemy health, harder boss fights, etc.
@fangzila SURELY I will do that
redbeard instead of 4 ropes it is 8 with even more enemies as fight goes on
oh yeah for the dog island people, this guy is a top runner of that game too
Ooh a Majora's Mask quizmo that'd be fun.
Gtg get dinner now, gl with the rest of the run!
just need to gold every split for the next 2 hours and you'll sub 4!
why couldn't this pit be like 1 meter deeper so you'd be forced to get Zora armor? :(
or is that sum of worsts?
at least Link climbs them faster than vines LUL
sand with or without ladders tho
can you climb up the towers?
maybe we gotta introduce ladders to the sands. show the bokoblins the wonders of laddering
shoulda just done the trick to enter without the key. That wastes what, like 15 seconds?
nearly 3 hours ahead of sum of worsts :D
got it too early? what do you mean by that
i get that. back when i used to speedrun i tended to get rather tilted if I couldn't even match my pb for weeks on end
Always amazes me how you and others can just memorize hours long runs full of technical tricks
I think the longest run I ever did was like 90mins
I wanted a change xd My first speedrun category was a sub 10min run and I optimized it to about 6min. Grinding that gor old
Like that has to be the most hellish thing to grind ever cause it's basically play as good as a TAS for 5 minutes straight if you are near WR level
Oh, wasnt this the place with the vanilla softlock?
It's when you save your game in the room with the cannon and then save n quit. IIRC
No clue either. Must've happened to folks though, I guess
I lost $4 that was lame
Brb I have to drive like 2 hours back to the middle of nowhere KEKW
Good luck on the rest NODDERS
@Midnaliin Wow you could've spent that money on something slightly less productive
hey just in time for the end
Is the twilight fully princess now?
I woke up like an hour ago
the rock is a crutch, just clip the gate without it...
i will be taking shots at home in remembrance
do you have any shifts this time or nah
yeah just had a quick stream playing peglin, as a good chunk of my home time today was waiting for a fucking water heater guy to show up to replace my water heater
so only had time for a short 2ish hour stream
it's like Peggle but a roguelike
oh, my title did infact said pegging if that helps
All of all of the dungeons or minimal amount of all of the dungeons?
I mean Peggle is about pegging
my title was just "goblin peggle? pegging? peglin."
its not even all dungeons, all bosses really
you have to get all of boss keys besides lakebed in this game right
@AnniLyn2 i wanna play this but aint got the money for it its not included in teh summer sale rip
@peachedpocky it like... is and isn't what you expect it to be
i mean, arealfos is a mini boss he dont count
is stallord skip allowed for this or is beating stallord part of beating the dungeon
I just drank a red bull and now I'm tired
Will nothing keep me awake now
caffiene and adhd dont mix well
I'm tired but that's cause I haven't had caffeine. That's a symptom of an addiction. :P
idk im not a docotr, wouldnt reccomend it tho
Not sure if it's a stimulant for it as well
Bͦest vie̟wers on streamboo .com (remove the space)  @raUngNNB
that was it, the one run
I drank 3 glasses of water, gone through a 40oz water bottle twice and I'm still dehydrated, apparently
he wants to stop the One Run TM
as we are only doing One Run, right
new settings means more junk for tracker broadcast view. So I took care of all of that today and right as I finished they updated the tracker AGAIN! So I had to redo my json all over again
I trimmed 14 rows to 10
whats your schedule like? Should I prep a yaml for tomorrow?
well, time for me to head bavck to my grandmas, will leave the pc on to lurk
im getting her chonese food at her behest today
yes i have hot water i can go shower now and then go have chinese next to the beach, its all coming together
(my grandmother lives next to the beach)
so someone in my AP group is doing paper mario for the first time. I gave them your updated packlist saying it should be good but there might be a few things its missing. Its easier to do than than say "download emotracker"
you saw my other Dm right?
basically, i loaded the new pack after i finished and it didnt auto track seeds
oh right, no updates for a while lmao
oh they ran into issues genning so they doing links awakening again so nevermind
All of the dungeons (That we know of so far)
I got my goal time for that 1 track and have been doing a bit of free roam
No 😭 I kinda am stressed LOL
Nah I don't work the mainline, I'll be there Tuesday
the thing i'm most nervous about is navigating the airport to the hotel
i'm sure i will but it's the basic "unknown place i've never been" worry
this is probably the only one i'm ever going to so i'm gonna make it count
I really want to go to SGDQ 2026 but I can't this year sadge
wait how long has mario kart world been on the schedule lmao
it's the penultimate title, the final bonus game
did you fall all the way down
yeah s&q is best back up
i’ve been getting the early frame lately which means i have to midna jump back up
i did not, was that just posted in discord today
been out and cleaning all day
that sounds pretty damn fire tbh
this is giving me letter recovery vibes all over again and i hate that lmao
i’ll have to mess with that when i potentially play later
i love when tears take a whole second to collect
not just me that’s made that mistake, yay :)
oh is that this one’s name
this fight isn’t hard to do fast but it’s so annoying to mess it up lol
i need to study the pathing on this snow storm movement, i kinda just get by rn
I cant gen, missing files from links awakening
oh that explains a lot now
can’t you technically practice it just after Snowpeak and before tot
me practicing any room in city
If it’s just for rusl TD does it need to be before GM
like for practice sake also Adge
why not the Goron mines one? then warp n Faron
nah you use the TD on gor coron
oh it moves with him eww
this looks better than Coro TD but still dumb
you’re right I think his text is advanced so it prob doesn’t work
his eyes are pointed right at link's crotch
I'm sorry Phantom, I'm afraid I can't do that.
that seems like a royal pain in the ass
i pb’d with an 8:12 boots yesterday, surely you can push through it too majinCOPIUM
my gold isn’t even good but so many things have to go right
ooh dumb idea I like the sound of that
i prob will work on that tonight after i submit my pb tbh
that rupee roll fail yesterday almost tilted me into oblivion lmao
but putting irons was a first time mistake and i hope it’s the only time lmfao
every category shares having to do goats and get iron boots at least :)
i fr forgot that was a category
you have to hit the drop arrow on src to see it iirc
why have misc categories instead of putting them on extensions
when’s removing reverse all cards from the main board tbhtbh
glundo is so much better than normal hundo lmao
we just changed the rules for mm hundo Kappa
that doesnt effect anything except nsr
it’d be like if you got gilded and then ended with razor sword
i mean tbf in mm you delete zora fins
streamer why are you doing all of the dungeons? you don't need to do all of them in order to beat the game. I thought you were a speed runner
i guess fins arent an item
if it was an item it’d be different i think
source requirements for mm just need the final upgrade to be valid
yea that one is weird tho if you ask me
yeah the boomers who ran pape didn’t think that one through
makes it so ocean spiderhouse reward is useless
i think they get caught up with defining stuff cuz it’s “arbitrary”
well getting the wallet from the banker is still a valid source so its fine tmz
but there’s no 100% tracker in pape 64 so it already is arbitrary
you just get both wallets from him lol
rando 100% when? :D Get every single check
also it removes oceanside which is one of the coolest part of the run
i mean you still go in there Kappa
we have spider house ils now finally also
imagine how fast hundo would be if you just didn’t have to beat the chapters
that’d be funny and probably better tbh
it really should be getting the star spirit, making it be on the card makes zero sense.
I think fighting all the bosses makes more sense than collecting all the cards
glundo is just overall a better category
just make an All boss fight category
just make hundo legacy hundo and make new hundo
i think my pb is that same September
it’s unfortunate cuz recipes alone ruin anyone wanting to route it
quizmo is bad but it’s not hard to route around
could be worse. Could be FF12 21 hour 100% category. And it doesn't even require you do the most annoying sidequest in the game :D
im ringing my vc hater alarm for just this game
do we know if switch 2 is faster than 1
I really wish you could disable those borders tbh
the closest this game has to good vc and the audio is complete shit lmao
I only notice it with speedy spin
i forgot about this, disregard what i just said
That menu looked pretty crusty though
it's really noticeable when hammering after speedy spin I feel like
So what is the wr for this category?
yeah but the menu lag is gonna add like 5 minutes
i often forget that's a thing lol
it just visually looks so good, why does it have to suck ass
the one thing they can’t get right
why the switch look so ass????
Oh so it's the old style rumble then
is lave piranha’s attack also ass
Also that fire looked like ass
oh no Bowser breathed orange paint on Mario
That was way better looking even on wii u
yeah the fire generally looks that bad
yeah they never got it right again
Oh so vc regardless of the platform
this game is a travesty to emulate for some reason, idk the details
that’s generally like 7:00 or sub 7 if you’re cracked right
i’ve gotten 7 flat before but usually it’s a low 7:01 for me
lopez just cranks 6:59’s like nothing lmao
crystal king blocks on this must be terrible
i use audio for those lol
i love me some baby strats
And this is still gonna be the fastest version, isn't it? aeroWHEEZE aeroWHEEZE aeroWHEEZE
is some of the n64 software at least okay on nso?
since that console is just ass to emulate from what i've been told
you’re better off playing this muted
i was timing action commands better when i turned off the audio lmao
I love this game Paper Mario is my childhood
god damn sony for this curse on gamers frfr
pro controler with notched face plate is nice, can recommend
See, that's why I bought that controller shell for the pro1 controller
all I got is that I hope all of yalls going will be safe
I dont know if I prefer it or not
like - I can deal without??
but like... I also dont play hyper precise
The only argument against notches is you can't move the stick as far in the non notched directions but like when does that ever matter?
@Darkness3827 to me that would matter for the likes of Soulsborne games, MonHun tippiThink
but also like... you could literally just make the notches be at max range respectively
you didnt get all coins from the first firebar
The LiveSplit audio is weird yeah
Oooh did you get a custom shell for your p1 controller?
it would take someone buying me a switch 2 Kappa
i have played on nso a little bit before
if they let you remap controls it wouldnt be as bad tbh
Just have a playlist of all the Pape soundtracks playing :P
The other console NSO apps aren’t as brutal as the N64 one yeah?
Oh man that’s hilarious it’s the wrong frame rate
thats nice that they split the boards though
i need to get a switch 2 so i can get some free time save in smrpg remake
funnily enough I’m just beating SMRPG remake right now
and Boomer delay horribly compared the rest of the fights
yeah he doesn't, 3 seconds or so time save per load if i recall correctly
im 3rd on breezy no turbo, i wish they would split the switch 1 and 2 runs but they aren't going to
i feel like my thoughts align with yours
Well when you have like 3000 hours of Pape…
okay I was going to guess 2000 first damn Sadge
Oh man I like your odds
isn’t sub 22 enter 1 like okay for beginner glitchless?
somehow ive streamed oot more than animal crossing
it’s every how smooth this is
i did some on ship a long time ago
Hmm somehow ive stream oot for 90 hours lmfao
monkaW new ttyd ap update added Tattlesanity
also added  FastTravel. Use the Map in the main menu to warp to any area you have been to before
I think watching paper mario glitchless is my favorite
Fast travel seemed like a little too much imo
I used to enjoy watching dr toadstool play it
i don't hate it but its not needed
most enjoyable speedrun for me to watch because paper mario is my favorite game
I feel that is fair but oof, I use too many audio cues, I could never
alright, I’ve defeated Culex what other post game things are worth doing in the SMRPG remake
oooh I might as well try those then
Tell me I don’t have to beat Smithy again to retrigger the re fights
Ahhhh I’ll give that a whirl
Oh yeah I got the voucher I forgot about this is it
are you playing on an nso n64 controller lol
oh thats sick i had no idea those existed
i dont even own a switch 2 lol too broke
how bad is the input delay
Hey Phantom! GL on the runs!
i wish i could have notches on switch 2 procon lol
yeah i really like it a lot
i have nso n64 controller so i would just use that lol
is there audio delay for you
im watching closer now and i see it so bad
I'm noticing it more with earbuds on
Partially asking just to add more stuff lol
i only have a couple playlists rn
One of them is literally anything i feel like adding
I tend to hyper fixate on bands every now and again. Previously it was the Longest John’s
they do sea shanties and folk songs usually
i guess that makes sense, but i don't wanna just delete it LUL
back in high school i listen to older stuff
like acdc rolling stones Metallica ect
enter sandman is 1 of my fav songs
I have some very eclectic music tastes… currently it’s a Korean beatbox group called Beatpella House.
If you get curious I recommend their song Rob Roy.
back in high school i was listening to enter sandman then everyone started to stare at me so i took my headphones out and my teacher was singing it my music was too  loud KEKW
I didn’t know Shinedown was still performing actually. I’ll have to catch up
I was living in Jacksonville Florida when they started getting traction but never got to see them live.
I was lucky. there was a big music festival put on by a local radio station called Planet Fest. There was like 7 stages all packed for a week
saw a lot of great bands and performers
its been a long since I’ve seen this game run in order
I was binging your Black Pit videos on YT most of last week
it’s looks fun but definitely seems to get repetitive where strategy is concerned
Humming a song we can't hear aeroVorb
just go onto discord and you can connect and listen to what Phantom is lmao.
is there any soap in this cake?
Kryptonite wasn’t even the best song on that album
I would say in general the most famous songs are not the best ones.
For a sec I thought you were talkin bout the Jade Jungle theme LUL
I should clear out my discords that I don't post in
So I don't talk a lot
having tons of notifications drives me nuts
I like getting some pings. The rest I use for resources and referencing mostly
Yeah that tends to be one of the first things I do to servers
yeah i'm in a lot mostly for news on games and stuff and those usually only ping for actually game updates and i'm fine with that
yeah I mute everything cept like the 5 or 6 servers I'm actually active in.
or the servers that aren't active at all lol.
Me: PINGSOCK EMOJI- oh its just my friend going live, carry on :>
i have never once taken a role in a server to get pinged when that streamer is live lmao
i'm on top of that usually
I always do then always just suppress the ping notifications LUL
I do suppress if the streamer gets a bit too ping happy
Or they have bad internet consistently
I think Switch 2 adds anti aliasing to N64 games on NSO now
I basically just supress all the servers I'm in cept for the ones that never ping or the ones that I actually want pings for. I almost never mute servers altho I often mute individual channels.
Muting channels is based and good
What controller do you play with?
I don't, share with the class when you're in text hell
Have you ever thought about using an N64 Switch controller for this game?
That is gross to watch every time
I can't wait for this lag
Smacking the blocks always gives a bunch
Is this game faster on Switch 2 or are you just running this to see what this game is like on Switch 2?
God Fire Flower should have been a pokemon but to op
Phantom the fuck are you the clown thing for
Autocorrupt managed to get part of it
Do u want to read my bday pokemon gains?
Is the right stick the best way to do C button inputs?
Oh, birth Stav?? On this, the good Gofest?
Galarian Articuno V special art grade 10, Dachsbun V special art grade 10. Medicham V special art grade 10, Rayquaza Ex from the set no promo grade 8. The raw dogs are Black Kyurem Full art special, Dragonite V sleeping cloud art.
I miss collecting, I stopped around HGSS when I played competitively
That seems like a good layout. Too bad i suffered through it with MM on wii u aeroDead
It's time for Fuck! This! Gameshow!!!
@FatPidgeyBirb in the tcg i have 3 wins 4 losses
oh yeah it did i guess
Nice, I would do best at prerelease drafts
I did average 4-3 ish on normal tourneys
my pokemon decks have been out of date since 2017 lmao
Fairy should have stayed in. They teased us on the Pink
I still get weirded out seeing poison in dark now, that's how long ago *I* played
yeah I remember when dark and steel basically didn't exist as types.
I think dark is a better place than psychic, but I feel like grass would be better
Then again the button mapping did have one glaring issue
@Darkness3827 I remember when Neo destiny came out and they were special energy cards to start
ZR was strictly for the suspend menu
yeah that's what I was referring to lmao.
Not saving one (1) frame smh
Crazy oversight on their part imo
Their mindset was likely that all of the main buttons were accounted for with the n64 controller
Because of Zee Rules (zr)? Idk
And it already had L and R
most annoying offensive thing they did was make volcanian weak to water like the makers do realize its a water fire legendary. and darn battery alert gave no worry and missed ezekial.
Fighting or lightning woulda made way more sense
how goes this presumably awful run
You just missed a double dink
only 8 seconds off gold despite the double dink lmao.
And missed pie jumps and hit two bullet bills in 1...
i heard double dink across the room lol
do you have to fix your hp or nah
THIS guy loves playing ads YOU
Fave character in the series time!!!
this shit looks CRYSTAL clear, holy moly
yo phantom hope you doin well
bad brain day, had to stay home
gotta stay locked in during these cutscenes
you're not jamming out to Mayor Penguin's theme?
cause I have spotify playing too LUL
Does switch 2 NSO save time?
I shoulda grabbed jammies down stairs, I'm comnfy on bed
Go mode for chapter 7 PogChamp
im here to learn proper dino room movement
Just crank an OBS filter on there
does switch 2 vc have any glaring flaws like switch 1
oh i hear a lot of audio delay.
if they care about their ip so much why don't they put any effort into making their emulators fucking playable bluesClueless
o cool i didn't know they outsourced their emulators
Nintendo is the company that sometimes makes Mario Odyssey and sometimes makes NSO Expansion
i have never heard of them oops
So many mistakes were made fatpidSleepybirddisease
Ice King just had to say no
oh my god the badge menu is horrendous I missed it until now
yo how's the switch 2 version of pape
Now I just gotta get onto pc
this is just like a rando now
who needs a cool gradient in their fire
Language lesson finished just in time
Just do it again before GDQ and get the free WR
The comeback will be remembered more. Ice King go away!
yeah I can see why people only play n64
This was a time to watch
Will be done on July 4th when the box set is officially out
@blacktiger51 just in time to ruin their day LuvSign
517?  You are gonna be reading names for a while XD
Can't get away from this song :D
ooooh shuffler! those are so fun
I see you play Zelda from your About section - have you ever played Z1R?
putting mario hp to 2 is evil
@blacktiger51 100% evil.  I love it.
That is going to be evil and hilarious
Hey Phantom! GL on the rando!
id like to get a look at your code KEKWait
you should be fine with emo tracker auto tracking. My experience it only doesnt track cake items.
oh boy just in time for the start
Just remember in 6 hours you signed up for this haha
how do you remember which checks you did between seeds, also doe sit save state when you swap?
dungeon shuffle will be rough to track
How do I do this I have never bits'd before, hold on
this website  is too jank for
Oh thankd goodness it stops again
Couldve been way worse. Could have been 50 bits to toggle it LOL
I like that this uses bits and not the dumb crowd control coins
Unfortunately I won't be able to donate much because of that July 4th Yu-Gi-Oh card hunt
Any idea how many sessions this'll be?
Is it an always toggle or random on load
I'm just saying hypothetically how could I pay someone to kill Mario in real life
The rare no speedy spin in rando
do you want me to edit the pin message saying the 69 1 doesn't work?
Is the code for the shuffled up to date on GH? Looking at mirror mode atm
there might be some good seed bleed soon
mirror mode adress is correct, but bit magic should read: (~mirrorstate & 1)
I wonder if we can reasonably get stuff like moon physics in this
incredible timing LOL that Parakarry is going everywhere
This might be one of the best things I've ever seen made
i was too slow.  i almost made it where that was the homeward shroom location.
Could have been better, I was hoping to do it before you had boots but was too slow
... I need to get that dungeon room shuffle feature done. That would be nuts here
i mean still a pretty annoying location haha
i'm surprised there isnt a disable items option.  unless i'm just blind
randomize equipped badges could be funny mid-battle
just wondering since the removing badges.  how does that affect hp/fp?
I don't think it should update unless you pause and unpause
ive already seent the fight before
Gotta style on Fuzzipede with the delish
that bowser fight will never end
emulator?  I thought this was original hardware. #scammed
I have audio again so whats this about?
will you do all seeds in a single stream?
rn I'm doing a 1000 slot AP and I'm doin one of the pape slots and it's basically everything vanilla and I cri cause there's like 8 slots and they're all like that :(
my guess is gonna be nowhere near
thats why it was discovered early haha!
would a sendcc work to poke it?
See now you don't need the scarf
that was a nice heal YEP
gonna have to save before every fight lmao
On scale of not to rando, how rando is your rando?
has your one run of switch 2 grind helped you deal with bizhawk's input delay? :D
Cheer100 Speaking of in honor of finding slow go I think you should have to use it :P
This should make for great Youtube
are there automatic swaps every so often?
You need to remember that when you go back there
I thought it was crossed out lmao
like a random place in the desert!
is it possible to delete random items from your inventory? :D
that probably shouldnt happen due to logic.
but isnt cake and such consumable?
ig deleting cake could be problematic
I didn't know that was possible.
time to make a bug repaort KEKW
a really funny redeem would be something that doesnt do an auto.  like "go fight jr troopa" or "go fight the extra blooper"
might need to sell things lmao
when it swaps it makes a savestate, if you gameover can you load said savestate?
set to 1 after you heal YEP
the forcing homeward shroom might be too cheap too.  since using it right before a boss might be too tempting
out of battle it's prolly fine, mid battle is a bit problematic
either way it was gg KEKW
If you wanted to go through the effort, this would be a fantastic edited into an hour, hour and a half video imo
That's totally fair, would be a lot of work
the randomizer is one hell of a comedian
I am having way too much fun with this one phanto274BLANKIES
this one?  But what about the other 4 seeds
245 desert screens in total phanto274S
clearly not enough.  someone gift 100 subs haha
but what if someone gifts 200???  thats CLEARLY poor planning /joking
oh no.  now i want to see this done with minish.
Wait you have keysanity off!? WutFace
I keep forgetting SlowGo is a thing
if you switch seeds mid Slow Go or any of the other time based things does it carry over between seeds or does it just pause it and resume when you go back to that seed?
No killing... Killing is mean and slightly rude unless they deserved it in which case it's fine
You have a letter for me? PogBones
I have 1 B... Which is not 2 B, but if I get another B I'll have to B
Will you go play NIER with your two B?
can you set hs location to literally anywhere?
it took 28 seconds to blocks with Bombette so by that logic it'd take 4 min 40 seconds to do the vanilla blocks lol.
did you save before this fight?
I think when you game overed but that was a different seed
what tricks are still doable but much harder with slow-go on. Asking for a friend... of course...
Ok streamer, do I nap now and work in an hour or work for an hour and then regret accomplishing nothing?
this looks so fun but so complicated at the same time
what happens if your on final bowser and someone adds five seeds?
then phantom cries on their pile of money
how many times can you redeem five more seeds?
I mean you could just use the reserve 5 as the 5 the next time you do one of these if no one redeems it.
the devs should look into making npc’s items in the world
scared the kitten while I vacuumed.
well we know we can get till the 2nd stair room without jump
he hid by the computer tower. now he’s fine. it was just so funny
at least you landed on the bee and he didn’t poke you
Yeah, until someone redeems 100 gift subs lmao
merlon has a crush on her obv
Oh we finally get to find the rewards
why would that be a bad thing?
if this was an AP I'd have a soundboard clip for that lmao
I am going to go make dinner! but I will be LURKING, be back after
It was close to ending then got an hour;s worth of subs and bits
do these seeds have glitch logic?
Listen you only need 35 chapter completions
I assume you're doing a thing where it's swapping between various instances of Paper Mrio
I just read the stram name smh
squirt a 3 whole times.  #quotesoutofcontext
everyone need a bit of danger
weirdly someone did do the 1k
Ok. Good news. I did not nap OR work
But now I need to do both
It's so difficult being me Sadge
Any chapters done in any seeds?
well you're gonna have to not remember for a little longer!
what the heck is a coin bag???
What would be the requirements for Goombario to actually be worth using in a seed. 1 FP and ultra ranked and everybody else 8 FP and no upgrades?
damn shoulda been quicker and set homeward shroom before you used it LUL
you could do this on console too, just need extra everdrives and a S video switcher LUL
You might even beat a chapter D:
well now you do have a hammer!
you may have said this earlier but when homeward shroom gets set it’s let seed, right?
cheer40 save your FP and items
I knew that but that’s hilarious he hammered
you have so much maple syrup they’re going to call you Québécois
He stares menacingly at the enemies
“Bombette go kill them, I’m too angry”
I did not expect so many of these seeds to be in similar places at the same time
You did such a good job with the swapping cuts
It’s so seamless it’s jarring everytime
I haven’t seen any dark koopas before have I?
this seed looks like an amazing meme
almost all partners, no basic gear
nah you did you just can't see her
amish which seed are we avoiding?
oh that gives me a plando idea :D
The seed bleed is gonna be REAL.
a small loan of a million coins
you can buy a coin! infinite money!
Cheer16 that loan has to come from somewhere btw.
wow if only that was the case in like 3 others
tune in next time to find out the rest of the badges
You do realize what 4x5 is, 20 hours lmao
Cheer100 you know what also slows you down?
damnit I forgot you turned in the portrait on this seed lmao
Wait, is that 3x Star Piece graphic new?
you do seems to be going back and forth between the same places a lot, yup, TTYD
Maybe I just haven't played with Koot since that update, yeah
Cheer75 Hope your memory is good ;)
5 HOURS AND 40 MIN FOR BOOTS!
rip the dream of bootsless bowser's castle.
every time it skips when you’re in that room I think log skip lmao
Cheer75 i said REAL MEMORY TEST
yo I have an idea. This but AP. Have all the checks be connected. LUL
That'll really fuck with you lmao.
Cheer75 lets break this though process
can we just replace ultra shrooms with a 50 coin bag
cheer16 loan sharks came by sorry
But yeah they've all gotten their use cept for 80 lol. That maybe should be a bit cheaper cause for 80 you might as well just go up to 100 and do slow go.
oh and I think the pitch shuffle hasn't been used.
this is the only dose I can handle random pitch in
think all the seeds loves ch 6 smilers
maybe swap it with setting your HP to 1?
that makes sense, is speedy was lower I think it would get used more
Honestly I had your stram on as background noise as I learned how to set up an archi rando
what game were you setting up?
Cheer100 that slow go is sad that you didn't pick it up. Now it's stuck in tubba's castle :(
oh wait that was a fake slow go right?
oh it did I was only half paying attention lol
I thought it was a reg block
oh my god the amount of hammers
oh hey it's the Toy Box!
A person can only handle enough syrup
oh yeah this is where I got scammed
dunno why that came into mind
idk if it's possible but Slow Go and Berserker should pause while you're in / out of battle so you can't scam them :P
cheer75 yo Lopez ty for the gl
yo amish ty for the gl
you might not have a chapter done by 8 hours
here I'll speed up these fights for you Cheer40
are you still going when I wake up?
oh so you breaking it up then
This is baby scaled so you should be fine right? Cheer40
i thought it was a "stream doesnt stop" kinda stream lmao
oh my god a chapter boss D:
and it only took 7 hours
I was about to do that lmao
Well I guess berserker doesn't work as intended
oh maybe it's cause of the queue???
mario is attacking the bits! he doesnt want anymore crazy effects
Cheer200 you didn't need those badges did you?
Not like he could do damage even if he did know
good luck with that action command
is the shuffler easy to do
welcome to 7 hours, 0 chapters cleared
is this the new extreme async?
"If I think I can get it done in done day, I'll just power through" - Phantom ~6 hours ago
yes, time to go beat chapter 1 Cheer75
1 chapter a day, youll be done in 1 week
25 bits is just mean.  LUL
Ah yes the one you never knew what it was
cliffhanger on the Piranha fight to go back to the start of the dungeon to see how we got there!
surely you don’t need that pow block and you’ve already beat all the dark koopas phanto274Smile
mario must be in canada @Darkness3827
oh hell no not this trick
the jump that made me want to quit any% tbhtbh
Cheer100 this trick requires precise movement so I'll help ya out!
where is the first chapter split?
hey phantom, wherre is my moment badge?
so we pay money to delay the ads?
pay money to delay ads for a month
i take it you have full view but broadcast is minimal?
you gonna have enough shorts for half a year
I just remembered there's a slot where you're charging up Watt! good luck! Cheer75
just pull out the TAS controls
I’m sure someone somewhere is 3d printing joycon shells with proper notches
when I play TP AP I use PowerA usb "gamecube" controller, luckily it has notches
the best is when notches are off ichimaiaAwk
yeah, gotta run on 2.10 dev
what if we set homeward shroom in that room lol
*game crashes*  Its only a flesh wound
2.9 works with my gamecube mayflash adapter
that is the most dogshit reason ever
because the n64 contoller sucks aas
the point of emu is to use any controller you want
literally everyone play oot/mm with gc controller ichimaiaAwk
they support PS4 controllers right? I don't think Bizhawk supports PS4 lmao.
ps4 ps5 xbox 360 xbox one all works
bizhawk supporting PS4 controllers makes sense tho, I use bizhawk for PS1
ps4 wireless req a driver and its still work smilers
well it's like normal seed right it takes generally like an hour and a half or so to beat the first chapter then the rest come fairly quickly. Just multiply 1.5 hours by 5 :P
so when you beat a seed do you remove it from the shuffle?
i have mega quake him before
well that's one thing you can do about it
@Axl_SR There's another seed where Phantom is charging Watt lmao
We haven't seen it in like 30 min tho lmao
idk prolly closer to 20 but it's def been a while.
10:28 Darkness3827 : good luck with that action command
yeah so 33 min ago lmao
over under finishing before 1 your time?
finishing what? the crystal king fight?
cause yeah the whole seed is def not getting finished
it'll probably be like 20-25 hours total
this needs the homeward shroom trap
imagine if it waited for the boo ring so you forgot which one it was
yeah after beating chapter 1 lmao
Still haven't seen that Crystal King lmao
or the other boss Phantom was fighting.
yes, and in the middle of action commands in both of them
Watt has been charging Electro Dash for 45 minutes
yeah I figured it was worth testing out
You’ll get maples and you’ll LIKE IT
21 years ago today the greatest megaman game released... now if only phantom would run it
3 chapters out of 35 now :D
we haven't seen a bowser's castle yet right?
watch pahntom get to final on the last seed then someone gifts 100 subs LUL
well ig that's 4 chapters out of 35
eyes are heavy im going to bed
hopefully your dreams don’t shuffle around
oh god you only have 3 partners still lmao
which side are you on!? we'll never know
That switch was timed better than anything we could have done
now would be a good time for someone to cheer 100 bits
but phantom already is going slow lmao
Just wanted to set the music to match the mood lol
too bad mirror mode doesn't work, that'd be a fun troll
So how's the anal fisting going
Is that 2 Toyboxes to Bowser’s castle now too?
Until it exceeds to 12 hours
Ohhh is it autotracking? That's smart
Blame your toxic viewers not me
a nice pair of em, one might say
Listen it's not a scam if I'm bitting first LUL
But it's funny either way lol
Seed 3 of course it’s only 3 partners
this is one of the seeds
Looney tunes style what’s this bomb doing walking up to me?
You’re never going to look at a maple the same way after this
9 hours in and still doing chapter 1 phanto274Smile
seed 4 will continue to jot have any progress KEKW
Still can’t get into chapter 7 anywhere
if it doesn’t I’ll be pissed
imagine trying to do the quizz with the shuffler
500 bits to turn the quiz on KEKW
The 9 hours with 0 seeds completed is sending me into oblivion
Yeah 2 is amazing at this point
Laki is just looking a little blue, he’s okay though
tempting but i have to pass
I swear to good it feels like it priorities shuffling on load
okay my thumb is cooked at typing peepoLeave
I wonder how the happened 🤔
it’s not like someone could take all your danger badges off or anything
or put you berserk when you’re trying to do final and not have him heal
I just noticed the Phantokens icon! Are they based on Miyu's symbol from Rockman.EXE? :)
i killed all the shadow beasts at EMS and runs were rough so eh
Howdy again Phantom! Funny raiding you again monadoCozy
ok think its time for Bedge
and i wake up tomorrow and you still live smilers
I didn't know it was between 5 seeds and now I worry about your sanity Phantom
was nice, just playing through a pokemon romhack, its pretty good
don’t mind me, may have drifted asleep
this is the seed i slow go'd you lol
picking this up tomorrow will sure be easy YEP
@Amishman19 its ok he already forgot every details of every seeds
Hey Phantom, you think this system could work on just channel points?
not gonna be any different Kappa
I might be interested in giving it a two-seed whirl
if you want someone to test just a Channel Point system
i know there's a shuffler somewhere that works with channel points
I mostly use Streamerbot, which I think uses C++
idk how different from lua it is
For a second I was like no way there’s still dark koopas to beat
never forget watt took 30 minute to charge an attack that failed
I’m going to dream about dark koopas at this rate
this is how Pichu feels about beavers after always joining Morp's stream during beaver races
Cheer75 i go sleep gl with the fight
I gotta sleep too, looking forward to tomorrow gn and gl
how many hours you think you've tossed into each individual seed? And how much time has you also lost trying to figure out which seed is which LOL
'the consequences of my actions have come back to haunt me'
go commit the sin of avarice, Mario
I thought it crashed for a moment
I got p4au for 9 dollars
oh I forgot dollars did that
I'm either playing the guy with a dog or yukari in this game I think
the dog guy is just fucked up looping 50/50s and yukari is APM machine
Yeah please make sure you get rest
Well i'm sure it'll be better than the sleep i got
It's been 11 hours do you think there's ppl asleep in here
christ I thought it was done
this must be what one's personal hell sounds like
It's a very unpleasant color sorry
I do not feel like looking at nonstop bright tangerine at 2:30 at night
Screaming man is way nicer than what I can make spongebob do
with underlaying undertones of fresh bile spring green
wait you have 5 seeds at onmce LOL
This bee with slow go is funny
ow my leg- Mario right now probably
Wonder why you have that on that's pretty messed up
Cheer100 shadow: slow go by the bgram
he made some good sounds in that one
I do love that adding by the gram to things makes him do that
Cheer100 shadow: yippee yippee wahoo by the bgram
I dont like the wet smacking sound that he sometimes does
Cheer100 shadow: wet smacking sounds by the bgram
Wow! 10 hours? This seed must be ass!
He did almost none that time
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
I love how he does yippee in that
well now I need to get 100 more bits I wanted to end with that one fuck
Cheer100 shadow: el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo by the bgram
It sounded like he really tried to communicate on that one
Anyway tonight I watched a "Game show" series about a woman going to churches and working with said churches to help a single woman find a husband
Now I know this sounds like a reality tv series but the thing is this aired on the Game Show Network
The had the contestants compete in a trust exercise where they have to guide the blindfolded woman through a field of cups of water and eggs
I'm not sure what to make of it either but I saw it happen
There was also a moment where one of the guys does a saxophone solo while grilling and you can see the visibly burned burgers he was cooking
meewixBedge bed time for me, i hope you have a nice rest of stream
the slow descent into madness arc
I'm assuming you're going to bed and resuming in the morning
Cheer50 I'm off to work, here's one for the road. Wish you great rest later!
yeah, I finished the set. We done!
i went to homing attack somewhere else and ended up here because the homing attack doesn't work right :P
Huh. My prime sub didn't work for slow go.
that's because the rando went galaxy brain and they're all in seed 5
And then he got an idea... an awful, wonderful idea.
These kinds of streams are a contradiction.
They simultamiously make the streamer's life better, but also harder.
thought maybe you’re racing the tournament grand finals seed
Can't wait till it swaps to the other seed that is currently here.
Wait, didn't you get hit by that one spiky beetle thing?
Lucky day? more like Fucky Day, amirite? PrideLaugh
that's too nice of a thing to call this
I can make it worse? How so?
i would encourage you to do either 100 bits or a gift sub
cause it'll be funny trust me
Challenge: Don't eat a habanero before the run is done :)
Challenge: Don't eat a habanero before the run is done :)
Challenge: Don't eat a habanero before the run is done  :)
oh no you found me shas
Stream was good. I also did a big dumb tonight shasL
call this metal gear solid 5 cause this is the phantom pain iceblueSmug
I spun a wheel of a bunch of challenges associated with Kirby Super Star Ultra arenas, and then did them. Like eating a habanero for the Fire arena in Helper to Hero, or eating sour candy for Plasma, etc
Also Powerless True Arena, which took me 3 hours and... I still haven't beaten. It's HARD hard
It was a great time! Also all in the name of raising money for Doctors Without Borders
Yeah Galacta Knight and Wham Bam Jewel are HUGE jerks
So... do want this run to be like... extra long or?
oh yeah heck wham bam jewel all my homies hate wham bam jewel
10 extra seeds would be funny tho
Heck galacta knight, all my homies hate galacta knight
you think you'll be done by GDQ
"Please let this be a normal randomizer..." "With Phantom? NO WAY!"
you're in the wrong stream if you want that theo :P
that shy guy is just standing there like "what is mario even doing is he okay"
@orangeisborange Thanks for the gift sub!
dang giant emotes don't do the slow go lmao
120 gift subs dear god beamqu2Fine
i think i should gift the legend
"Did you really think I was going to submit?" <= me when I've got a fanfic that's ready to publish
Name the next file after Aki.
I think I gifted 130 in total? I forgor
aki gave phantom 120 subs and now phantom can get to yoshi on top of the castle
who or what did the fuzzy steal
i still think the funniest one i've seen was when they just stole kooper entirely
not even his shell, just him. a whole ass person
Consider that a down-payment for the prizes stuff for Speedtember later this year :P
joking: the fuzzy has varia suit
I see now why 100 was gifted
my favorite thing is you were so confident in saying it calmed down
then aki showed up and that was quickly proven wrong
I recall the funniest one here being when Goombario was stolen by fuzzies, and the star piece in koopa village was watt. If I recall, Phantom refused to do the fuzzy minigame till the last moment.
nah this is the funniest one theo
Goombario knows what's he's done shasEvil
imprisoned for crimes of being goombario
it doesn't, it has a trusty drying pan tho
what's more confused, auto tracker or you?
also i find it absolutely hilarious that you kept commenting on not having kooper in that one seed and LOOK WHO YOU STARTED WITH
randomizer was like "hey here's kooper you needed kooper right"
what's the time frame between swaps
orangeisborange thanks for that sub pog
I was not expecting you to be available right now
I'm only awake cuz I have to drive my mum to work cuz she decided to take her car back to the car wash after said car wash messed up a sensor on her vehicle, making her spend another $75 on a tow
I got off work at 10pm yesterday
WOW, I wasn't prepared for that musical whiplash
so recap, what happened after I left?
I see seed 6 that doesnt look good phanto274S
Does that discord dm need an answer soon or nah
Pride100 welcome back to hell, population phantom
cool, cause chillin on balcony rn and would have to look it up inside
yeah I did. had a fire close by. remind you I live in town.
I am waiting for my sister to get back from the dentist so I can drive my fatass to Target and play some Donkey Kong Bananza
Cheer75 morning Phantom I hope today goes well for you!
@Axl_SR There's a demo for it in Target stores
I tabbed out why did I just hear Link scream lol
I'm great at breaking things here lol
wait what why are this many more seeds, dont tell me
wait why are there 10 now.
Just a few it seems haha
oh god. i wish you luck and tenacity, and i really mean it
You just have to scroll down a biut to get there
lol orangeisborange came in and did stuff
aki caused chaos as aki is wont to do
Cheer500 lets have some chaos i guess
Good lord this is insane lol
HOLD up did i see that right did that say seed 10
does it stop shuffling into seeds that have beaten the game btw
seed 3 is blessed.  pretty sure seed 3 has the great homeward shroom too right?
Don't go into the randos channel on the disc 👀
I don't know seems pretty central
you're screwed for the toybox one tho
much better wandering the desert KEKW
What room in the toybox would be an issue I wonder ... The train cutscene maybe?
I think I made the wall bombable from the right
Wait, so the homeward shroom sets you in the General Guy dark room?
that way its still ass but not gamebreaking ass
if Mario can't jump, is not Jump Man?
that's odd. I think I interpreted what you wanted to accomplish with the bit magic
so we can just blame icebound /joking
that pin message is not forever btw 6 mins left
i mean technically, ultimately, this is all my fault
ice its not something to stress over haha.  its just fun to tease.
blacktiger did just fix it haha
This is truly unforgiveable, Ice. Go to the corner Kappa
i didn't know that was a thing
If you aren't entirely tired of and burned out with pape after this, we can try fixing some of the stuff together :]
ooh.  high scaled 1 and low scaled 7
HOLD  does that mean full er
full er is coming either way
just takes forever to plan properly
and then there is seed 3
other day I got a new water bottle. Its from sea world lol
That will teach you to talk to strangers
Wait, so Parrakarry can get you onto the box in harbor, but not the hills in Jr's Playground?
even has the thing you freeze and it screws into the bottom of the lid
sounds too cheery here let's fix that cheer50
oh god the cursed flower fields
I was watching the vod didn't make it to the extra 5 seeds yet
I think this it the worst place for random pitch
and thats before we get to the weird pitch /joking
logical moles?  Sounds like we need dr mario to look at that.
oh I got here at the right time
I think that is forever the funniest thing you'd have to do in a rando
hey instead of buying those key items can you buy me that fried egg
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
loan shark had a few debts to collect from yesterday
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
reminder we should do beserker mode when he tries to fight moles amish
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee weeeeeee by the bgram
His fucking slow yip pee in the middle of that gives me life
Cheer12 we might need more items
oh no, the moles, they're too fast
these sounds are worse than shadow
so about that thunder rage haha
slowgo for the next hour it seems
@Icebound777 mario just speeding through life it seems.  take it slow sometimes
Mario just got bumped and lost his contact
Mario went so slow he died
the fact that seed STARTS with moles too
this is already hell without all the shenanigans LOL ngl I feel kinda sorry
dont feel bad.  they signed up for this ;)
what is your wish?  To have the seeds not be trash
@gyroguy123 Those water gifs aren't cheap.
i want it to be this weekend... and then i want it to be october lol
i need digimon story time stranger
we're getting fucking gundramon. we are getting the GUN DRAGON phantom. in GLORIOUS 3D
Too bad the HS doesn't have the location in the description
I got gifted? Hello, thank you.
Mr Phantom it appears you are phantoming
Are you at least having fun?
Cheer75 tune in next time to find out!
Pride75 but where does chapter 1 take you in this seed
I still laugh every time it’s shuffled, what’s wrong with me
so, I'm new. What are you doing?
basically Phantom is playing 10 seeds (now) and it shuffles randomly between them and also we can give bits/subs to make Phantom suffer.
me when i try a grapefruit soda and don't enjoy it: "squirt sucks, actually"
it's funny i don't like grapefruit juice but i love grapefruit soda lmao
the soda is cool too i guess
I hate when my pan is dirty and I can't make tea
was it seed 5? was it seed 9? We'll never know
what will finish first? this shuffler or 100% hyrule warriors?
i see 451 attempts... I thought this was your first time doing the shuffler. I guess youve been to this rodeo before
surely power rush will hlep now
can’t wait until you finish 10/6 seeds
I mean the counter is pretty unnecessary anyway cause it's gonna be another 20 hours before a seed actually gets finished LUL
Cheer16 that coin bag was actually a trap
Pride75 back to a bad seed
Cheer20  a very damaging trap (that effects multiple seeds ig cause I'm slow lmao
why cant you just jump up the stairs
wait you cant jump without boots
gonna be honest, i havent been playing my switch2
i didn't even buy a switch 2 KEKW
i don't like racing games nothing on the switch 2 for me
i dont like the random stage balancing either
is that a japanese thing or more a nintendo thing?
yeah I don’t think you could get anyone out of that block phanto274ColonD
oh right this seed where you die lmao
Okay no more from me on this seed, I want to see what’s after the moles
do sleepy sheeps work on moles?
Cheer10  have a life shroom kinda sorta.
how many seeds are there and what kinda logic
including stuff like letters and koot?
i was hoping that would go to the other seed with that fight
found a pop tracker map logic bug. Just DM it to you?
its an old one I remember reporting from emo tracker lol
I can’t wait to watch the several-part vods whenever this gets done
i can't wait for part 69 where you still have 4 seeds left
it'd be funny if every time you got to like 3 or 4 seeds left someone donated another 100 subs :D
vanilla?  in my randomizer?  how dare.
Pride75 I didn't say you could go back to seed 3 yet
lmao i swapped you off of that one earlier so i had to make the joke lol
I made a thread in PMR from your WIP zip so anyone can post and have it all in one place.
@LordOfDuh Thanks for the gift sub!
no longer the king of dodging subs Sadge
it said game over so you're in another seed
do you have a YT vid about this particular trick? I’m curious what’s going on here
excellent. I’ll be watching that later then.
what does 0/6 mean below the seed number?
don’t worry Mario is on the case
altho that'd be tough to time lmao
Wow still same seed. Did u beat huff puff yet?
are u in logic or did the bits take u out of it?
Cheer100 Ooh look! It's Slow Go!
I've been craving taco bell since last night....
Curious, what did you use for the shuffle? Is it crowd control?
@Mitchflowerpower welcome in glad to see u here. Love ur utube channel.
Watch you getting boots and getting out of the seed
I mean given how long it's gonna take to beat a seed it could prolly just be manual tbh.
Pride75 you're taking a break. from this seed.
phantom how are the seeds going
chat wasn’t working for me. lol
Having fun with the swippity swappity?
Oh hey welcome back to hell
His last thing is his dignity or wha
that's what i said via TTS at the start of stream swift lmao
Pride75 things to do in this seed? not anymore
wow it’s been a little while since this seed rolled around
Wait is this the second Ruins Stone Skip seed? I swear you got it last night, right?
3rd time to do Ruins Stone Skip, eat at Arby's
it hurts my soul to see a seed this unfinished yet
i remember the seed that rolled back mid map action so you popped out of bow's protection into lava
how is pain and suffering going today... oh i see we got 5 more seeds LMAO
i went back in the vod to see it
the fact it went RIGHT back
not another all partner no gear seed
so against bothering with that they went to a different seed entirely
Ooo, I got a gifted sub! If you see Orange, please thank them for me. phanto274GL
not many so you were one of the lucky few
Also hi, Mirby! Hope you're doing well.
@Amishman19 just saw this clip omg this is so good
do you have it on no logic?
wouldn't no logic run out of check within minutes in like 95% seeds?
ah fair, but what about the blue house :P
what is bad with this seed?
phantom your problems won't be going away until you beat bowser 10 times
Pride75 disappointment is in the castle
this with no boots is KEKW
i need to know what this does
good thing the warranty was still good
why do you display the tracker with only the key items on it as opposed to the one with the letters and stuff?
why not have all the seeds trackers on stream at all time Kappa
beamqu2Wand Beaming in for good luck, hope it hasn't been too chaotic
And it went alright! Managed to get through the Ghostland Yard challenge though I wanna try and get the time down even more. And did a Fusion rando to celebrate.
this seed is so cursed lol
Phantom's a ghost. It ain't cursed for them ohheyi30Hehe
hot damn, even the ghost is cursed phanto274D
I hope you are for your sanity LOL
I finally finished my shelves, now I just gotta mount em and try and convince my mom to let me get two more shelves to DIY those >_>
The Goodwill had two more smaller shelves and they'd look real good on the wall
it's kinda wild it's almost been 3 years lol
i was definitely not trying to time a watt charge lol
oh jeez you still don't have jump on this seed??
wait. 7. oh no. you madnerd
I'M BACK IN THE FUCKING BUILDING except it's the tree with Parakarry
Pride75 giving parakarry's arms a break
Cheer75 go back to that other seed its missing you
Pride75 Junior Troopa ran away with this seed
I know it's probably nonna my business but I'd be so curious how much you made off of this chaos
we'll find out in 50 minutes when you switch off of this one and get shoo'd to another
I have a jar of diiirrrt and guess what's inside it!!!
back in the fucking jungle again
that pause before just walking away… savage
your notepad probably looks like a nightmare
why are any of us here
Mario's had ENOUGH of dimension hopping for nothing
this music kinda cool for this fight
was just curious about the extra seeds, did someone donate 100 subs?
bradha1RocketHorse bradha1RocketHorse The rocket horses have arrived! bradha1RocketHorse bradha1RocketHorse
How's the brain drain and seed bleed going?
Has he cleared any chapters yet? bradha1Laugh
A few on a few different seeds
are the items swapped across the different seeds?
but it's hard when there are 10 seeds going at once now
archipelago woulda been kinder than this I feel
ah that's what I meant, was wondering if this was basically a solo single game archipelago
if it's not the jungle, it's the woods
just think of the dopamine when you get it
I was just thinking that. XD
but hey at least its not no shortcut + having to sushi fish everywhere
it really likes to bring you back to this fuckass seed
how dare you getting tired after 9h of hell Kappa
kooper locked para would be megara11Wobble
Cheer75 i said no seed 2
all the first 5 went to flower fields and the second 5 sushi glitch Tubba lmao
i think fake goombario is the funniest item in the game
Cheer75 i said NO SEED 2
glad i got the perfect timing KEKW
oh I just noticed no boots monkaS
i think seed 2 will be the last seed done
this is going to be another all partner before any gear isn't it
it's giving don't forget, you live here forever
i love how the win music is game over
I feel like swapping is much more effective than setting shroom location
I don’t think you’re getting dirt
Pride75 I huff and puff and blow you to another seed
berserk mario killing the boss was the funniest shit
HOLD i think i know what time it is
pit necessary is so rude 😭
enjoying rando. Are the swaps timer based?
Mario boot too big for he goddamn fish
ty for strem! get some good rest
okay. hope your appointment goes well. hope you sleep well
oh you been going for 10 hours didn't even notice
had desktop audio muted, one sec
I just got up from a nap
Chat, I'd tell y'all to be gentle, but gentleness doesn't pay the bills. Be rough, sluggers~
Every time you say something about beating a chapter, it's gonna happen lol
i hate discord mobile, just got the noti you went live
Same Axl.  I waddled in late too
We might finally finish a seed haha
500 subs restarts the run /joking
I mean I'm sure there is a setting to delete the save file.
But at that point it would be insanely high since yikes
Oh doesn't this look familiar lol
Hou made it to 7 in record time.
In Ch6, is the Cloudy Climb transition only loaded upon riding the vine? Or is there any conceivable way to trigger it otherwise?
Dang. No funny "under the map" loaded actor shenanigans?
Looking over my physical switch collect I noticed I bought the same game twice
I'm so sorry.  I just love setting that location as the homeward
Uhm...can we overwrite it and then just return it to there after you find boots?
what has you trapped? I assume no way out of prologue?
I'm so sorry.  I meant it to be an annoying location not hard softlocked
was homeward taking you here before?
It's fixable, just gonna take a moment
When is the last time you saved on that seed?
"We interrupt your rando with an impromptu lesson in N64 memory addresses!"
It's fine. Now they know how to fix it lol
I just did the running joke of me setting that location.  Didn't even notice the no boots.
we will encounter each other in one week
nah just tuesday evening to sat morning
Seed 8 and seed 3 were extra cursed
I made dinner for my family as a surprise
I mean I will destroy a soft tortilla taco for sure
I only didn't do quesidillas cuz those are best fresh
And most stuff was done before my family got home
Oh flipping mirror in forest would be evil
.....also I don't trust myself to make those
Hello Sushi, fancy seeing you again
Everything else I felt confident in doing
holy thats a lot of swaps.
And I could keep fresh for a good amount of time
how many seeds are currently in the pool?
Where's the fun in that? Kappa
I know how to make a good number of things
You can count on me for mac n cheese
How is THAT the logical progression here???
Do Paragoombas not aggro on Sushi?
I'm not seeing any bit messages. Is this just random swapping?
5FP Fan Smack is pretty harsh
What's on Ch6 entrance in this one?
And Ch4 you need jump or Parakarry...
Lotta seeds just love making you do this glitch, huh?
i come back to bootsless sushi glitch
are you more sick of that trick or pyramid? LUL
i was so confused for a moment why you came from the right
1 in 30 is better than 1 in several hundred
did you end up completing any seeds yesterday? I fell asleep
mfw Phantom aint got the fat booty: "No cake?"
I get paid tomorrow. if you don’t finish I can support then lol
what if you made good progress but god said "here, 5 more seeds"
that will end up being the last seed you complete
Found soil, beat chapter. Got shuffled to another seed also in Crystal Palace
got a fan to help circulate air upstairs so we don’t die of heat while gaming 😂
did you offed the seed generators mother or something? jeez….
Why are the blue pipes different heights?
nah its not a sushi glitch seed at least
oh god no boots for precision movements but also no hammer to be able to change mario's direction
that sounds pretty much TAS level ngl
excited for your run of this at GDQ
glad they're giving you an entire weekend for it
@ThePinkReaper oh I should probably look at the schedule KEKW
oh good, I'll never forget that
Just wanted to grab a water bottle. Speaking of which
When you swapped off that seed, I knew that was going to end up happening lol
Power Bomb at 5 is crazy
i though it was a FP heal KEKW
i'm usually lucky with gift subs too
there's a stream i've had a total of 11 individual gift subs KEKW
2 more chapters on this seed yay
What determines the Koopa Bros falling over? Bombette's Bomb does it, which would do about 4 damage that early normally, but Watt no action command would only do 1 Piercing
So would Egg Missile do it?
i get people shilling for PP it is a very very big benefit but some def do it too much
most people only do it on the last few days and that's super reasonable
there are some folks that flat out guilt trip you over PP… I get that it’s a big deal but come on
yea guilt tripping is not ok
Oh hey, and you have Parakarry. Can't softlock this time lol
it is a 20% sub payout increase which is nuts
i meant 20% from what you get
+10% is 20% of 50% nyacinthsNerdge
The fact that they even have percent payouts for amounts of subs is insane imo
yea, its the entire reason why the program works
because of the 3 months requirement
if it was required to be year round it wouldn't work neiher for twitch nor the streamers
I saw someone do their push for multiple months....
i know someone who did partner pushing for 7 months
yea it was one such case
You can reapply after one month so idk.
i can imagine a few reasons
The first one is pretty much always rejected unless your bringing a giant following from other platforms
but i wonder if there really is one even
I just can’t get enough average viewers to get affiliate. but I’m keeping my head up because one day I’ll get there
@Penguin_Cuddles unless you already met the requirement for a while
@AngelLove94 if i did it, i believe you can!
I salute ya’ll doing the streaming thing. I kinda hate the “business” of streaming. couldn’t be me
what annoy me is all the bots and art scammers
that's similar to what it is now
unless it changed in the last year
Mario must have the lung capacity of a god
I really want sushi… and some katsu…
seed 6 is a dumpster fire
Welp, that Koopa is a secret Mousketool that'll hurt you later
has there been a crowd control style setup featured at a gdq event before?
Holy crap I just noticed this seed has Jump
I was looking to see if there was a Jumpless route to Moustafa lol
ok thank you for clarifying. I was brain blanking on how to ask that question correctly
...Is that why the Mario 64 rabbit is called Mips?
the Mario wiki says Mips was named after the processor.
Mips sounds like one of those old timey diseases you cured with snake oil and cocaine
Oh no.  The seeds didn't pause
Swapped to Seed 5, that's all
There is one seed where you're about to be smacked by a Koopa
Hey its more fun to watch your face go deadpan when you see another bit donation by penguin HypeLol
Is something wrong with your notched controller?
9 swaps away from the coveted 500
Gonna swap computers. Try not to crash the game in the meantime Kappa
meowdy Phantom, how close we getting to any seeds being done?
damn, you’ll have this done by SGDQ for sure
okay it might be tight then monkaS
The weird way you have had to do this trick multiple times today
Actually snow king?  In a randomizer?  Shame.
I don't think I've ever seen this guy
I don't remember him at all
but he scams you and takes your money
I mean to be fair he does live underground in a pipe.
It's been like 6 years since I played this game
I sure can understand what's going on here
Can’t believe your homeward shroom led directly to a fight Mhmm
@Swiftalu you should DM Phantom to get all the fancy stuff he uses to do 10 seeds at once swapping between them at random :D That's help you learn the game really well!
I had some concepts in mind I wanna get down before I go through the effort of pulling tablet out at computer
phantom which seed is closest to done
oops I meant actually you know press the emote 👀
Until someone else shuts it off
it'd be funny if Mario was on the right in fights in mirror mode
oh right from her chaos edition starting stuff
Shot in the face, you say!?
@Darkness3827 tbh I'm more impressed that it isn't
I guess you can't just flip the screen because there's UI
how many do you need to beat?
sorry for all the questions but why is it jumpless?
oh you have no boots at all
ah yeah that's useful to have up to date
That's nearly one every 3 minutes lmao.
yo that dude took the perfect line around that block lmao
just wanna make sure people know how to phanto274Bless
I always forget Kolorado is down there
2 Versions. One for the fake-out attack, and 1 for the Raphael cutscene, I think
Oh, yes you can sell *an* Ultra Shroom!
As the saying goes, no plan survives first swap lmao.
One more time for funsies lol
Just in time for another swap Kappa
So much money being thrown at you
I wonder how long this would take with decoupled entrances
"It's not real" *Touches it anyways*
lmao nice knockback into the shooting start
What you get for hurting him
Damn, that Snowman Doll wanted to show you its home
i have a metronome on my phone set up for stallord and my cat went feral over it for like a minute cuz it has a display of an actual metronome NiceSoftlock
she kept trying to actively bite my phone, i was so confused for a sec
reverse mirror clip wouldn't bring me back to rta for this but it'd be close
haven't seen this use of sushie glitch lmfao
hide his shell in the woods
What a rip. Jr should have taken double damage from all those attacks. He MUST be part flying type at least
Well, that Watt attack is failing lol
everyone gather 'round and try to spot the frame
well look at it this way, at least the bridge is done when you get back lol
we need a celebration for that jr kill though
If only there was a separate timer for each seed lol
so when you roll a seed there is an option have random pitch on for everything TMZ, after 10 minutes it’s so bad I start to dissociate lmao
Hey, you got a discount on that one! You only paid 63 coins!
almost 4 hours in how ya feeling phantom
oh god mirrored sushie glitch? D:
I’ll put it in the rando discord too
Mr Phantom how phantom is the phantom that you are phantoming?
ong the bot @‘s people too? classic
Can I offer you a nice egg in these trying times?
Why wouldn't I be able to?
I dream about it every night
Except in my dreams it's usually me dreaming that I don't get a new job for some reason and then I cry
It reminds me in another stream they talked about how they bought like 3 dozen eggs and their partner was like "Oh okay you're just gonna flex like that? That's kind of an avocado toast moment" and then had to explain to their partner what that meant because they didn't understand the avocado toast meme
Lucky for me, up until like 3 months ago I refused to eat eggs but now I'm okay with them but for a while I dodged egg prices
Almost like you were *just* there...
But I also only eat eggs when I'm eating out anyway so still mostly dodging them
oh shit hide it from tmz quick
I could probably afford to give you *one* *medium and reasonable quality* egg
I didn't ask if I could offer you two eggs in these trying times
what could one do with a singular egg?
Inb4 another swap before getting Tubba Castle- LOL
Snowman gift maybe but too far
Guess you're *not* getting Heart(or whatever it is) done this swap lol
Auto timer swap it back, please!
Can't finish a seed yet, that would be too easy Kappa
Just looking for the ch6 items this seed?
....That one is Merle, right? I have trouble remembering some of their names lol
Snowmen stole the Star Stone just to give it to you early lol
Actual maple syrup in this economy
Also I guess Lee hated you showing off too
wait is this go mode? etchySussyAmogusVenting
you are safe, for now zfgSpeedPolice
Ok Mr Phantom I just had a great idea
here's an example of the shuffler in action Cheer75
Did 2 swaps just happen or jsut one lol
Phantom was in Boo's Mansion for a second
Ok Phantom. Perfect idea: Egg NFTs. Because eggs are so expensive, my NFT provides a cheaper way to buy in to the egg market with a digital, virtual, non-cracking egg
We take the funds we raise. Right. And start an egg farm
@Mitchflowerpower was casually playing Paper Mario, time to teach him some skills huh KEKW
And then we use those eggs. Sell more NFTs
And then we do as NFT does
And then you can have two *or three* eggs of mild quality
Phantom and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad seed
wdym sushi glitch is fun Kappa
What would happen to that item if you blocked it with Stairs and it was required?
So anyway my idea is pretty awesome, right?
Best idea you've heard all hour YEP
I'll let you know when your eggs are ready for pickup
never fails when I start to stream my kiddo wants something. 😂
I gotta head out now. Good luck Phantom. Hopefully chat and the game are nice enough to let you finish *one* seed tonight lol
How many did you guess it would be before you started?
for how close you are on some of them yeah. skin of your teeth
I went for a run earlier, and I've been sneezing a LOT since I finished
@Amishman19 not sure if it is / isn't allergies, those usually aren't a problem
@buff00n ugh that sucks, probably some nasty dust or fumes then I guess
@Amishman19 fwiw, I did a LOT of breathing through my nose, so maybe I'm in the midst of clearing out my sinuses
Blink twice if you want a heal
oh right the double focus seed lmao
been lurking did you beat a seed yet?
i mean you did ask for this KEKW
how are we just going back between 2 seeds KEKW
Cheer75 Hope your not attached to this seed
going to bed cuz work at 10am
give it time and I'll make the bot say even more unhinged shit
I don't benefit from a racist system, sadly
the bot's already got CBT and titties in it's vocab and whatever else degenerate ramblings I and others have said, you cannot do that much worse
you'e invited to take that as a challenge
you know I can make it even worse
@SwiftPichu_ you're such a casual degenerate, Swift-chan
ok but would that be bj or anal
you've got tentacles at your arousal, and you're only thinking of bjs OR anal? expand your horizons
I see hole I put penis in hole
tentacle is for your ass buff00n
no this is just a wednesday night for me
at least you knew beforehand this was gonna be bad
ayo someone pass me the good shit
that setting is and always has been cursed
this is for all the required sushi glitch
i do like some cursed seeds
this feels like a disney GBA game
didn't have to do anything KEKW
I've been dabbling and in Toontown again and was reminded about all the weird encounters I have playing that game
there was this girl plugging her stream yesterday and I took a look and saw her hitting the bong
it feels like i've seen sushi swimming in forest way too many times
the more awful it is to reach somewhere, the less useful it is
Sup Chip? (Idk what chup means but it rhymes with sup)
I'm alright. My birthday was yesterday. I'm 21 now
Thanks man. It was alright. I got Donkey Kong Country Returns for Switch
wait a sec, there’s a Laki teleport for Green Station?
dkc returns is a really fun platformer
Yeah I'm actually playing DKCR on my Switch 2 and man the game looks soooo pixelated in handheld mode. It's a 720p image blown up on a 1080p screen. I wish Nintendo would enhance it for the new hardware
that sounds like half the seeds
You skipped the Jam n Jelly?
Oh nvm you went back for it
Did you load a save state?
so you kinda know where Bow can be now at least, kinda
good to see you’re close on a seed
Wait are does the Star Chest work between seeds or no?
Yeah that would be a cool update
oh right, homeward shroom got shuffled
you know what could be funny
a script that randomize what action the partner does
and its just the entire game
Have you ever 100% a rando before?
also, I was watching a Rivals of Aether cpu tournament with modded characters
the Mario I entered got 3rd out of 32
Oh I just realized this is mirrored
the final was a ditto match between two Knights (from Hollow Knight)
"this trick is called "Fuck this guy in particular""
don’t like an annoying enemy? just remove them from the timeline
there are two type of names for glitch and tricks
@TheMasterZelda see StinkyFart from Pizza Tower or whatever the hell it’s called
and then you have oot's RBA which is a mix of both KEKW that one doesn't make sense
that’s why there’s no other fish in the jungle
you can'T get BA without doing RBA is the funny part
i'm never gonna recover from this
surely that’ll get used at some point
out of all the randos that I’ve seen you do, I think I only remember seeing you actually use Focus like twice
nice snowman dolls in Dry Dry Outpost
I just realized it’s almost 11
funny you say that, it’s 1:45 where I am
also seems like the weed kicked in
we're in this for a bit
honestly this rendition barely sounds different
touch fuzzy, get dizzy up in here
wait do we have a grubba chase sequence soon?
i NEED to hear it randomized
i mean in any of the seeds
this reminds me of either Wii Music or Trombone Champ
i think that train has a cold
random Toad Town is fucking killing me
holy shit this is awful KEKW
it's astounding the frequency that the music is wrong
wdym seed 2 died a long time ago Kappa
So if more seeds were added at this point. Would you hate life?
Got it. Shoot. Next time! I'm still almost done with day 1 VOD
No, on twitch. I'm 12 hours in
can’t wait for 50 hours of rando vods to binge
Relaxing time for the past 2 days
So I'm going to bail and catch up soonish! GL
Hammers and boots always scale gradually no matter where you find them right?
I know. That's why I chose it. No pain needed
GIVE IT UP FOR DAY 14
Cheer69 this seed looks to normal
@grover53 Thanks for the gift sub!
AND HE WILL FORGET AGAIN LOL
if these guys could just cease to exist like that one jungle fuzzy, that’d be great
brb don't dare go to seed 2 paperLurk
And the site auto did the knock
orrrrr if anyone has 69 bits, you could cheer 50
maybe wait for an unmirrored seed for 69 though
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: Hee hee heee heee hahaha yippee by the bgram
I dont want uneven bits and the 69 fucked it up
Ok cool I'm #1 bits again
I can go to bed now have fun with that
Enjoy the loud scream in 10 minutes
happy to see no seed 2
maybe some day n64 emulators will be able to render pape properly
i remember like 10 years ago it was just unplayable KEKW
still one of the trickiest n64 games
its like the evil plando i made of mm where goron mask was on a goron check
it was Don Gero Mask, which you need Goron to get the rock sirloin to bring it to the guy and throw it to him
you can BA hot spring water on specific items to make it so on the next load zone, it gives you the rock, and you can throw it with any form
except i also plando'd hot spring water to be at an awful location etchyLmao
undermiser style that requires extremely niche trick?
crystal palace inside a volcano is pretty funny
me doing every single check in my SS rando just to find out Whip was vanilla chest....
your still going and I’m getting off. I got grocery shopping and other stuff to do tomorrow
I was doing a paper rando. have 3 stars to get but I think I should go to bed since I have lots to do tomorrow
I’m missing watt, a tubba key, and the jade raven otherwise I’d be in go mode.
btw did you know in TP Mini Freezards can freeze bombs???? i found that out yesterday and was shocked
probably similar. if they touch the bomb it just freeze and shrink down to nothing
gonna go to bed and dream about paper mario gn
i gotta go because my phone is at 2%. have a good rest of your night phantom and chat. take care 💜
nice this seed has all partners
all these fancy dungeons with keys smh
D: they gave you a nice soup
deep focus is great to get away with the most bullshit strategies
i saw someone beat bonetail in ttyd by spamming the heck out of crystal stars KEKW
they let you get away with so much bs KEKW
ok mirror mode is seriously starting to fuck me up KEKW
i was like "why is he going that direction" KEKW
ok im going to sleep its your time seed 2
Not only one but 2 chapter 6 items
I want a donkey to fuck my ass until I squeal like a horse
I think my ass has two holes now
Unless you live in Asia it's Friday, or Australia
What you need is cawfee bawss
I drink it with milk so it's rarely hot lmao
One more day until my Yu-Gi-Oh! shopping and I'm going to not have to pay as much for the cards that I want
Mr Phantom do you think the Egg NFTs will sell better if they are certified non-GMO organic?
I hope you got some good sleep
No clue why the star beam is not tracking btw. Memory location is correct at least
I cant believe I fell off of mario kart world before I could play it with Phantom
Then you will be banned from seed 4 phanto274Smile
it just doesnt have staying power
like ive played for idk 25 hours? And I still could not name what my favorite course is
Having not played it it seems like the single player is super cool but the multiplayer is pretty meh.
you know people, make them fix it
I didn't think that was possible, online tends to be booty with Nintendo games
random has like a 25% to do 3 laps
yeah, ive already turned to my switch 1 backlog
How does finishing a seed workm
Like if you are in parade, it won't switch back to it anymore?
also ive decided to go all digital on switch 2, but for cases like prime 4, ill get the switch 1 version then upgrade it
The tech is wild and so neat
Got the shuffler lua set a seed as done by itself? We have a flag for finishing a seed
i just dont want a library split between physical and digital
All my console games I buy physically but I haven't bought many console games.
I'd buy steam games physical, if that made any sense whatsoever
Sure, I still have two dozens of old PC game boxes. Like the big oversized ones for the PC versions of FF7 and 8
I prefer physical, knowing someday the hundreds of games I have will not be available is... it makes me sad
physical media forever until it's not sustainable for games anymore
And sadly it's getting to that point 😔
Holy moly I can use my own creations we're so back phanto274Wave
Ok but what if I DIDN'T you ever think about that
So do you need to do 10 of these
Wait are you playing 10 at once LMAO
This is where a spreadsheet would help :)
This emote is still peak phanto274Ban
I don't know why, it just is
I love gassing up my own art :)
That is unfortunate it sounds like for you
I am going to work on the ones currently before I leave at least!
Probably not, depends how fast I am the next 2 days which also heavily depends on "Am I really motivated or really distracted"
I feel that way about tea
If it was cold I don't mind it as much but if it was hot I mind it a lot
I mean I'm from the south p much all tea is sweet for me 🥴
I make my own tea in the morning anyways
It's earl gray, I add some milk and vanilla syrup and it's perf
Ok. I updated the Egg NFTs as certified non-gmo organic grass fed no pesticides
I like whatever tea is being served at Asian restaurants
Going to make so much money now
I'm just a huge fan of earl gray but I do like some herbal teas like peppermint or passion
Ohhh I haven't done that, I feel like I would add way too much lol
I do lemon juice, ginger powder, and honey if I'm sick
What I do is I just don't have time to get sick so I don't do it because I gotta get to work instead
I just got over being sick
I thought it was just allergies and it turned into a cold. I got lucky though it was mild and no fever
I am a professional gift sub dodger
IDK why we are commenting on that tho
I think you can enable an option to not show yourself on there
I can brain any sub-only chat train
I still don't know what to do with all mine
Animated emote slots make the world go round
gonna have to come up with stuff :P
Just make animated emote where each frame is one of your existing emotes
having a animated lantern ghost would be cool.
I wish I did live2d animation type stuff but I like frame by frame so much more in terms of appearance
I know I wouldn't be satisfied doing live2d
Ok so Phantom I am trying to decide
It just looks a lot more unique in the sea rn
Do I order desk and chair while they are running the current sale, or hope the sale later in the month is the same price and then I'll also have a rebate
I feel like with the wait I reached peak: "I spent the past 2 months without one, what's 2 weeks"
So my answer to that one is I could survive without desk by using dining table or even just like one of those TV dinner folding tables. Chair I would probably try to buy either way because even if I decided to not use it for the home office I could bring it to my work office and use it there
I can try to get a court order obligating it to be finishable YEP
How many seeds in Gomode and how many bowser kills?
Hey all! And oh boy mountain hike time
May as well be playing Celeste if we're talking fighting the mountain that is this challenge
Celeste spikes give me seizures fun fact while super meat boys doesnt.
Even on photosensitive mode? It's the spikes themselves?
True indeed and it must be the locale as well.
The only time I got through celeste is i was forced to change the stream of minimini352 to 160p and it started my habit of multitabbing twitch streams.
I may consider offering animated emote comms in the future but I'll see how this one goes first
It is a lot of effort lol
Swift you gotta do the pro capitalism strat which is to charge like the price of 3 Switch 2's and then someone pays it than like it's worth the headache until you decide you want to do more :)
If I have a base it's easier (ie swifSilly ) but if not it's so much more annoying
Honestly that is what animators should be paid
@Zeliversal Lmfao depending on the amount of time it probably would cost that much 😩
@Swiftalu Ok then 6 Switch 2's
20 hours of work for 30 seconds is not unusual for properly rendered things
Not to mention needing to render all of it at not 112x112 would take longer swifFlop
Tiny canvases are the bane of my existence
Tiny canvases my beloved because I have shaky hands so it's not obvious at a small size tippiNice
I literally did SS's recent comm all with a mouse because when I free handed the final lines/color it was TOO shaky LOL
That's my secret 👁 at super large formats you size it down and the lines unshake themselves
So I put it on comp and started using curve tools to make it nice and smooth
I don't normally use them cause it tends to screw me up, but it helped with that specifically
I miss flash tbh, I loved doing vector art on it
Oh funny, yea I free handed that bg
But that was before Adobe bought out macromedia
See it's easy to make smooth lines when you don't think hard about it
@FatPidgeyBirb I grew up with no stabilizer tool sixeFeels
The seed is like your chat!
CS5 be like 🖕 to stabilizer until I switched to CSP like... uh, 4 years ago lol?
@Swiftalu 😔 yeah I grew up on dip pen and India ink
@FatPidgeyBirb Traditional is so nerve wracking
I had photoshop, that's all I can say :)
Esp since it's so easy to drop ink when you pull it out of the bottle
I bought CSP a few years ago cause I was like fuck adobe
@SeventyFourTG I have this as well
I also nabbed rebelle recently too but haven't had a chance to play around with it
Oh that's right I also have rebelle somewhere
Well "recently" like a year ago now
well just think about it for another 2 minutes and you'll be somewhere else!
I've been too much stuck in Blender Hell to be bothered with anything but CSP
I want to learn blender, I have no idea where to start for 3d modelling unfort
Get Vroid and I am so serious
Thought you were gonna say maya lol
NOTHING SAYS AMERICA LIKE A TRUCK
It's free, will give you an idea of how UV image editing works, and you do get a functional model to study later
I thought it was fine 10 years ago
Photoshop was also fine 10 years ago
Blender is free and has many professional resources and is easier to understand
I would say easier... def not easy tho.
I've learned by proxy of learning to edit parts of my models individually
Nah fuck it going to go z brush
*only knows 3dsMax and fuck that thing*
blender is more complicated that miya
Shortcuts are important but not necessary, you can get to where you need to with menus and the like
Yeah you can manually get to edit and object mode and remap stuff
Most people still use a billion shortcuts tho
Which is obnoxious to pause and keep watching for their shortcuts on their keystrokes
I really only use tab and mirror myself for shortcuts
KappaPride but doesnt every coder live only in hotkeys KappaPride
I use more hotkeys in CSP tbh
wdym yall don't use ascii art twitch client in shell?
up with hot women down with hotkeys
@SeventyFourTG I wish I could pin this
You ever think about how this sounds like spyro music
@SeventyFourTG how about up with women in general, fuck if they're hot or not tippiThink goomeeDerp
I love hitting a button by accident then spending an hour trying to figure out how I've fucked everything up and what button I've pressed lmao.
@Jonxhas have you considered all women are hot
lmfao the sound blender got introduced
Maybe I've grown up on spyro music but :vvv this does not sound very spyro to me. Lack of organ and guitar
TMZ hating my enjoyment of music
@FatPidgeyBirb I think it's mostly just the sort of chill vibe at the beginning does a lil bit?
also different versions move around the shortcuts for some reasons
its like why do you keep moving them
I might be overthinking it lol'
i started learning c++ a couple years ago. came easy to me. later learned that its "more difficult" to learn than other languages
i use 2 different version, one for work one personal and its so annoying
I need to get back into learning shit
me when i want to hit f12 but instead hit f11....
hey - "at least they let you modify hotkeys"
I got to classes or something like that in my Python book and just kinda got distracted by 500 other things
WHY IS F11 STEP INTO DEBUG WHO CHOSE THAT
nvm I didnt say a thing
like - I know coding software in particular is fucking DUMB when it comes to hotkeys since everyone makes their own hotpot of garbage
but like... WHY would you change them between versions KEKW
yeah visual studio is so trash lmao
so - I saw that you were doing this yesterday but didnt fully parse
don't you love all the AI analyzer they keep adding into visual studio BatChest
is this 10 different seeds, each on their own settings
I'm so glad I haven't run into this shit yet, and equal parts horrified of what is to come
and apparently extra bits dono things happening? KEKW
@TheMasterZelda Is it easy to get rid of by the by :v
the worst part is they're butchering intellisense with AI too
I use PyCharm for Python and Netbeans for Java
i love getting autocompleted invalid code BatChest
so why is the world mirrored KEKW
well - I dont have any bits, but cool KEKW
half the seeds are mirrored by now
I'd cheer 69 bits but I'm a sadist
Phantom decided that they wanted specifically to hurt themselves with as much bullshit rewards as they could think of
so basically someone had 6.90 and chose this for you ToadmanStare
I mean TO BE FAIR mirror mode on its own isnt too bad
but with glitches in the mix?
the mirror mode is what really trips me out.
Sushie glitch has already burned them more than once LOL
yeah mirror mode hurts my brain
Cheer5 fuck up the old man
so..... you wrote pape64 crowd control?
cus thats what I am getting from this KEKW
don't worry chat will heal you
i look away for 10s and you're on seed 2 Madge
I assume you can do pre-shuffle triggers? Could help doing a copy to LUA tmp then, then write once the shuffle is done
oh god its switching the tracker dynamically as well
but is it just tracking your item screen or is it also dynamically switching checks on the map of it tippiThink
like - I get that autotracking is easy and wouldnt care
btw if Mario throws away a cutscene item due to full inventory, no need to pick that one up. The pickup flag is already set then
Ok Phantom, through advance science I was able to determine that shipping is free, so I could order just the chair and then wait to get desk
@Icebound777 wish TTYDR would do that
@Icebound777 you HAVE to have had it in inventory once
The science was extremely advanced and scientific
so you're double chucking if its garbo minimum
only if it fully went into your inventory does it count it
then again its also kinda silly that instead of - you know - SKIPPING the non-important fights in the pit for chapter progression, you can instead buy your way up the ladder there now
but oh well - I guess its already good that one can buy themself up the pit ranks with 20 bucks a rank
I can get behind that though. Still allows for shuffling the post-battle coins from Jolene later down the line
not like TTYDR doesnt throw money around like its nothing with so SO many unneeded badges
I mean - if thats the issue, post ch3 glitz pit sits there for one
and for 2, you could always derank the hard way
like - just make it be a choice without the coin investment *shrugs*
Although I don't envy James and team. That game has some annoying story progression to deal with in a rando
last I played, it was "beat minor to major for yoshi check, rawk then grubba for win"
tbf most of pm64 is also like that, kinda
64 is also a series of hallways tbf. We just don't get locked into areas. Except for the murder mystery part
kinda, kinda not yea - what I would never say is given pape64 decomp is done, ttyd decomp afaik isnt
with pape, people can figure out where which story flag is and such easier then with ttyd at the moment
and BOTH games love their story flag nonsense, just one of them is more restricted on it
ch4, 5, 6 lock you in yea
@Jonxhas I'd be surprised if peeps like jdaster64, zephiles or pistonminer havent mapped that out to
ch7 locks you in midway through
@Icebound777 I would kinda also be surprised given the shuffler existed for a while mapping it all and such
but I can only assume its a PAIN
yeah and chapter 7 is pretty easy to turn that off since it's just NPCs blocking exits.
cus last I played (before the glitz pit QoL from june29th) the wedding ring train ticket section was not synced between the return trip options towards keelhaul
pretty much essentially game-wise requiring you to be able to beat ch5 before train ticket because you needed to take specifically the boat to travel
One huge advantage we have is that we don't have to care about memory. We just abuse the expansion pack to hell and back. TTYD has to get creative with it
thats not something I have experienced KEKW
also didnt experience that one, guess I should give it another try though
That part I don't get tho. Like why is the ship gone right after the boss battle
What happened to the sequence to cause that
@Icebound777 because usually ch5 goes "cortez, intermissions, crump"
and crump gone => no ship
I mean sure, but why not set that post chapter-5 state the moment you enter the ship cave map instead of before
then the player can leave and the ship vanishes if they return
I guess what they could then do with the post intermission (or should be doing) is load the outside keelhaul section with blown up wall to get back in
fast travel via the map yea?
I read about it but wasnt too intrigued
at the same time, I dont necessarily mind it
If they ever get entrance rando working the warp will break stuff I think
also jade raven inside the volcano
What's the farthest travel in ttyd, baring Palace of Shadow?
@Icebound777 the farthest could be like going from glitzville to pre crump on the moon?
like - vanilla pathing thoughts wise
you COULD count pit, but then everything goes to pit from wherever
haven’t seen a required weight in a damn while
Prayge bombette there would be really funny
Yo.  I have been lurking.  Stream has been great.  Hope you are well
We also have long treks in 64. Anywhere to Crystal King is agony
And I'm still on the fence on fast travel
what about with Slow Go? :P
but yea like - imo the fast travel thing for the standalone TTYDR doesnt necessarily need to exist
for AP however its a godsend
and hey - if it gets put behind a toggle option, both ends would be happy
The thing I think could be cool with fast travel in 64 is if it worked like the songs in OoTR, where you can learn to warp somewhere before having gone there
@Icebound777 come to think - given the forest pass is a unique item to rando yea?
could you not then implement more such items for those types of things
just that "oh I got this map spot pass now I can warp there" can be an option
Forest Pass had a sprite and I think an item name. No description and no effect
The only sprites not in the vanilla game are the Homeward Shroom, the Coin Bag, and the panel hints I think. Oh and triple star piece
A few tries yea, with one coming close
someone donate 50 bits so we can hear the funny
Changing the hash isn't an issue tho. The only things that care about the hash are Archipelago, and the game itself on boot. But the boot check only reads like the front 1mb or the like
how does LTTPR do its thing with sprites in Archipelago?
cus I mean - both player character sprites as well as color shuffles are there
and you can change it at any time
then next in my brain-list would probably end up being OoTR with the likes of custom models...
which you are ALWAYS loading those in afterwards via post rando seed patching
ahhhh ok thats where the crux is
matching a compressed format and size
yea I get what you mean then
I was honestly just spitballing what you most likely have heard or read like 50 times, just felt like "it cant be that hard can it"
goomeeDerp sorry if it souned silly
Dang one seed is almost done
You're good. I like discussing this stuff
As long as I no longer get blamed for that ugly 4k mod not working with rando
@Icebound777 that sounds cringe so much
thats like whenever I hear someone complain "this specific OoT visuals only mod doesnt work" or "my ML64 Model wont load here or there or crashes"
like - coool, move on KEKW
nope and i don't want to see it
I mean some of it looks cool. And more power to the peeps that like that look. But please don't bother me about it, lol
especially given that one is a visual doover
more pixel = objectively better NODDERS
which in turn implements its own things to work maybe, therefore "a visual do-over" doesnt necessarily function
look i've seen so many oot/mm "HD texture pack" and they're all ass
*points at MMOoTR where you straight up cant load all the loadable, workable Link models for reasons only ML people know)
the one which I'd give okay vibes to is the one going after OoT3D in style
which like - cool, that is on theme at least
i could agree to that to some extend
they NEVER looked good, not in StickerSplash and not in Origami
frick those stupid frickin outlines man
Oh that was the worst. Like, sure, white outlines, whatever. But they offered that version of the pack for free, and locked the black border version to their patron for a time
a) they know, b) which sicko puts MODS behind a patreon
You can argue that it was a) more work, that they b) did not actually want to do. So "gimme money for that" is fair
either a) you do a compete overhaul mod where it fucking makes sense *points at say, FO:London* OR b) dont make mods be something people meed to buy
that’s what gets you a Nintendo strike
@Icebound777 if thats the angle they came from, then they can still have the patreon. and who's willing gives them support either way
my personal mega current hate are all the n64 "pc port" with 60 fps widescreen and people are streaming those more and more instead of og and i'm just like
can i just turn blind pls
no it actually just looks bad
the animation frames are just wrong
@TheMasterZelda on one hand? its cool that it exists - on the other ESPECIALLY current day? all I can say is I am not surprised if things happen that they happen
i don't mind the pc ports themselves but some people are insistent that anything below 60fps is an abomination and you should just quit gaming forever if you think otherwise
AP only supporting MM recomp makes me die inside
"this is how it was MEANT to be played!!!1!1!11" no it fucking wasn't
also all these are actively hurting n64 emulator development
if it was meant to be a higher FPS it would've been a higher FPS lmao
@TheMasterZelda specifically why I havent MMR'd in AP
like - I get that MMR to AP is a stretch in and of itself
I grew up with PAL OoT, low framerates cannot hurt me
lmfao was it really that low? KEKW
my brain does not recall it being that bad holy fuck KEKW
it can be even lower if you play MM limesUwu
Yeah pape is 25. Still makes me cringe that even with the game running slower kid-me was too bad to do jump action commands
pal MM go to swamp and start hovering
@TheMasterZelda again: I dont recall it being that low for either - but also like - its been AGES since I played on the N64
and WII U OoT and MM both were NTSC rereleases, not PAL, yea?
anyway i don't hate recomp on a concept but i really hate what its effectively doing
@TheMasterZelda I dont even hate what its able to do, but moreso what people end up doing with it
those make me cringe so much
yeah just decomp. Hit the port to PC button. Then recomp
wasnt it that way even just after OoT?
it's an issue with superiority complexes in general, and a lot of people who play the pc ports and insist it has to be 60 fps act like they're so much better than anyone who still plays the original on console
you aren't better than anyone else for how you play
@Mirby_Studios you're summing up a WAY TOO popular youtuber from the european areas which I recall deciding not to watch anymore about 7 years ago for exactly that type of behavior
decomp is really cool because it helps understand the game more. but then recomp kinda split the community, rando dev (eventually making og hardware support obsolete), is a direct nuisance to n64 emulators development (by decreasing interest), and also they end up modifying the game so much its basically a fan game at some point
and what did they end up doing? only the worst of things from there both related to and not related to videogames IMO
for accessibility and preservation the ports are good. on that level it's a great thing. but when it comes at the cost of proper N64 emu development, as mentioned, and gatekeeping and exclusionary behavior over how to play the games "right"... that's the flipside
ports are TERRIBLE for preservation, they modify just way too many stuff
i'm a fucking dumbass when it comes to the technical side
so i'll shut the fuck up regarding that point
actual preservation imo => emu, but decomp comes close in that aspect somewhat
its like calling remakes preservation, its not exactly right
accessibility is more of the argument
the issue imo with decomp projects (especially with how seemingly easy recomp is) is, that it IS that easy to use
which given we know the parent to the games we're trying to preserve, we should really think about whether an easy way is the right way for this or not
thats all I really have to add to that since I lack the indepth understanding of how either works as well as other things, but I also hope that what I mean by that is easy to understand PrideLaugh
i have a friend who won't shut up about ship features missing in oot AP and they go on about how ship is so much superior and i'm like, bro, 99% of these feature are possible as romhack its just people don't bother there
ship OoTAP isnt there presently yea
i'd like ship ootap but only so i can use my mega man x mod lol
can't wait for it to replace the emulator one 4Head
and the QoL to some degree just wont function on N64 due to restrictions by game and such
honestly would not be surprised that it would replace it
oot is so old i haven't change yaml KEKW
and it in that aspect for OoTR wouldnt be tooo too bad
the option for online multiplayer on some of the ports is kinda neat
yea and that makes me actually furious
given what I have heard about how BAD OoTR additions can be with 10+ forks and "what do we want to put towards AP"
i've waited for so long for MM in AP and its dogass recomp
recomp made it delay that much longer and now its just recomp Madge
with MMR its a simple thing of license
basically you'd need someone to recode MMR towards the new license and new language
ap doesnt work with c plus
and while Zoey has mentioned being okay with it being ported over - yea find someone who wants to basically recode the entirety of it just for that
and YEP code implementation does nothing
but who want to do all that work
hence why all the effort would be needed
I forget if it was GPL
buts its conflicting with the one from AP tldr
when combo rando done for ap you can just do mm only
@blacktiger51 also not what I would do
because MMOoTR MMR is also quite different
both in how MM handles itself as well as all the extra stuff I personally dont think MM ever needed rando side
I have not a single clue what you’re talking about
I’m just here for the rando
the fact nax put the time into making them happen is mostly tied to how MMOoTR essentialy HAS to "OoT-ify" MM a lt to make Combo rando work
and sorry - but MM only MMOoTR is "I play OoT in a different skin"
i always get confused but GPL is basically just basically MIT but can only be used for other open source / GPL project, right?
how does it work with modules?
sorry by the by if I sounded harsh with what I put to MMOoTR things there
but like - I am tired of hearing MMOoTR MM only is "the new N64 MMR way" for lack of better terms
i understand the intent but yea... its kinda shit
@Jonxhas tbf its only missing a few things from mmr plus you can use oot items
Pride75 You're going to another seed instead
MM only MMOoTR is "OoT in a different skin" @blacktiger51
forgetting what you were doing upon walking into a room: the game
you can NOT utilize the cycle nature of things in MMOoTR at all for NOTHING
NO smart cycle use to farm rupees if you lack better options
no "I just use my brain and relocate with deeds to access things"
plus: essentially with the settings applicable to MM in MMOoTR, the cycles become irrelevant completely
def seed 6 at this point
I remember back when seeed 3 was the worst seed
was that the one with no boots and hammer forever?
you dont have to route smartly anymore for efficient seed solving because the game logic does not have to take into account the access to items once other settings MmOoTR has because it doesnt have to think about cycle access conditions come into play
cool, didn’t know that was tracked
do I have to explain it in more detail blacktiger?
seed 8 was the best until it got boots Sadge
@Jonxhas you can farm the Dodongo grotto for rupees no?
@Jonxhas yikes, so un-MM the game basically
because the chest stays spawned in MMOoTR
Ok. So what I could do is I could order the chair now. Use the chair and my table as a makeshift desk until a few weeks when I can get the rebate on the desk and hopefully still have a good sale price
Still whack that the "yoshis freed" jingle in the cave is a unique version
and the OW dodongos IMO are a shitshow if MMR can give you a silver rupee or gold rupee on SCT heart piece
just finished my first dark souls rando
@Jonxhas pretty sure they drop 50 rupees each well in combo anyway
i have a head ache now
you cant "find a chest with a good rupee which is quick to farm" and use that for fast farming
@blacktiger51 does finding a silver rupee in clock town get outplayed by dodongos in termina field?
best rando tho would be Demon's Souls :D
oh yea reminds me of my friend who was saying how ship is so much better because "it let you use hookshot as child link" and i'm like
sorry, but all the things that RESPAWNING CHEST CONTENTS for non-progression items means (which works in MMR standalone) do NOT work in MMOoTR
tomb of giants + enemy rando Kreygasm
oh apparently Nintendo is getting sued by consumer protection in Brazil
i just didn't know what to say etchyLMFAO
and MM only => "oh cool I play MM but with OoT rules for shit"
@Jonxhas yeah but what do you need all that money? for the big bank check logically  req biggest wallet in combo
yea have fun farming swamp grass for forever every time you need rupees because its among the quickest things non-lights
between it just completely changing the game, and it being possible on og hardware too, all you need is to load an actor for hookshot to work
which I KNOW MMOoTR has the same ranges available there which MM has
@SeventyFourTG yea i saw that but they're suing on the bad clickbait of "nintendo will brick your console"
when a minigame starts costing 400 a pop, I am going swamp to farm the rupees
or I am bottle duping gold dust
@Jonxhas so who crazy enough to do that  (i did wasn't fun)
@Swiftalu did you whip up 30 animated emotes for Phantom?
@TheMasterZelda yeah I've noticed there seems to be a lot of misinformation over that small tidbit in the user agreement
my point: MM lives off of you also being able to utilize niche routes every seed can generate for these types of thigns
MM only MMOoTR cuts all of that smart thinking out the window
I know exactly what she's working on in the sense that it's spam, contains images, and is incoming
nintendo will brick your console if you shove it up your ass
because a) gold dust isnt farmable, b) good rupee finds which you COULD utilize multiple times in a single seed via cycle resets dont work, c) other interactions which WORK IN MMR do NOT work in MM for MMOoTR
@SeventyFourTG basically there's 2 points: 1- Nintendo can restrict your account if you are caught doing not ok stuff (already happened with account transfer from hacked switch 1) and 2- basically mean "we are not responsible for a system brick if you hack your console"
sorry again if I sound superbly harsh there
but what makes MM be its own thing is that it has the time based things to care for
@Jonxhas i totally get what you mean, it feels like a watered down MM
@TheMasterZelda thank you for not making me sound completely crazy PrideFlower
@Jonxhas nah man you good we just have different opinions NODDERS
like - if its QoL like MM3D's song of double time? cool, am down
like its cool those options exist but when they become enforced is when it gets cringe
how many seeds are left anyway?
TMZ will just spend 75 bits to change em lmao
@TheMasterZelda and MM in MMOoTR enforces it, solo and combo-way, because thats how MMOoTR HAS to handle it for Combo rando sake
because a) moon crashes cant void progress in OoT and b) you cant really put items which would reset on cycle reset into OoT in MMOoTR if you were to keep the cycle consistency for other things
which dms? I want to contribute to spam
I mean swift did warn ya
therefore c) MM in MMOoTR just always gets turned into OoT
which for combo rando is fine
wait that's what AP uses? yikes
like - there's a difference between the quest items being kept through time and you being unable to use resource drops for your game again and again
@TheMasterZelda for MM, AP uses recomp
no clue how they handle their things, as its still early steps also kinda harsh to judge
@Jonxhas yea i know and i hate it
that's how you get into a head on collision with a shy guy
I could have sent it at a better time
to me its basically just that AP supports an MM fangame SMILERS
who would spam you in DMs, rude
@TheMasterZelda what I do know is that MMR's dev and someone else I know are at least in contact for the recomp things - my complaint would there also kinda be that MM-based items landing in MM should be able to reset
be it resources like potion contents or rupees and such
as much as fucked up routing can occur and be enforced by the game that way because rando, thats very much what ends up giving MM its soul in Rando still IMO
I will say with the adjustments of that 1 thing I mentioned it looks soooo much better to me now LOL (I did not vibe with it so much in initial concept phase)
and comparable too that I'd say would be if say, you were to take the errands for Pape64 as a comparison where ya need multiple coconuts or koopa leaves and such
making it so you have a respawning source for them and such
well at least this is go-mode too
or any battle item of Pape64 really - if it lands in world on a shop slot, its farmable for the player
in MMOoTR, that kinda to my knowledge doesnt work as it is
hopefully a Bowser Kill will open floodgates for the other seeds.
seed 2 is almost done Kappa
and MM's side only really functions for that end by flat out enforcing that either a red or blue potion is available in a shop last I renember
i've been meaning to make food for 2 hours and haven't yet
sorry for derailing that much with my MMR brain from when we initially were ranting about the decomp and related things out of "how does TTYDR handle something" PrideLaugh
just... brain brrrr and me no like hearing "oh just recomp oh just MM only MMOoTR"
@Jonxhas fucking braindead responses to me, both of those
@Jonxhas both are req no? the wall redead only take blue irrc
@TheMasterZelda This seed is also go-mode tho
@TheMasterZelda hey - do you want to shuffle them rapid fire once all of them are in go mode then? KEKW
Pride75 fuck seed 6 all my homies hate seed 6
my eyes i hate mirror mode
just to see how many frames you can let phantom advance between things? KEKW
and here we are ack in seed 4 LUL
metroid prime multiworld is based af because it supports playing in a real wii
I like having versions of stuff
id love to commission people but my brain anxiety cant
i just cant settle on what id want ever
Phantom waiting in line for a full day for the midnight release of Swift's commissions LUL
@TheMasterZelda Talking to people is scary
But almost every artist I know is super friendly
@Swiftalu it's easy, all you do is walk up to someone and say you're hobby is gaming
phant is whipping out the big doc. watch out folks Kappa
id def commission people i know so thatd help
This is so many things LOL
When Swiftalu's commissions are closed do you hit up SwiftPichu to maintain Swift synergy between the artwork? :D
You're gonna rival me for having a bunch of art of 1 OC
Idr how much art I have but it's over 100
My issue is I have both money and art ideas but no purpose for said art
Yea of just 1 OC LOLLLL but she's a really old OC so that's why
i have money and purpose but anxiety brainge wont let me settle on ideas
In all honesty, I could stand to drink more water myself.
I mean it is the hell one lmao
I've been playing that TTYD64 hack too much, I keep expecting stylishs to be done.
More importantly what will swap 669 be?
when will we get a 64TTYD Hack?
We're having mac and cheese and some mixed fruit cocktail tonight.
D I S G U S T I N G
fun fact this seeds has all partners
i swear bizhawk has inputs issues sometimes
it's not that hard, just bounce. bounce. boom. dead.
well yeah there aren't any input issues if you don't make any inputs :D
whenever i play super metroid on it randomly it just drops all inputs
pretty sure it just drops input at some irregular interval
Pride75 a test of your memory for when you come back to this seed later
I was about to say "I could be so evil right here but I won't" LUL
I saw it coming, I knew someone would. XD
its painfully obvious with super metroid, i just hold a direction and suddenly it stops and i jave to release the dpad so it can register the input again
its probably waiting for the windows Press event
hello i got offline raided so im dumping these chatters upon you
cloud was just sitting in the bus taking a nap and people boarded it for some reason and they got driven here
don't you hate it when your house gets raided and you're not even home to see it?
Wait, how did I get here??? Hey Phantom! GL on the rando!
yep! i'll be there most days in the evenings
also maddy's mom confirmed she's taking me to the airport saturday morning
i hope the uh, whatever this is, is going well....
@cloudd I have never met you but see you at FF sixeTada
it's for profit so it's only so masochistic.
@Swiftalu looking forward to it :D
I get along with almost anyone I think(?)
i'm gonna need to enlist some of yall to help commentate Breath of the Wild......
@cloudd You're in luck, I used to watch all shrines so much back in the day swifOld
Also you're gonna need to finish this soon or you're gonna have to pivot your RaF run to finishing this up LUL
Ye back when Limcube and Joedun ran it
erm that was tear of the kingsom
rip and tear of the kingdom
(I'm sure there's also other people who'd b more than happy to help commentate too don't feel forced to have me LOL)
Paper Mario: Tear of the Kingdom would be a good name lmao.
i'll pit everyone together in a zelda trivia contest pfiveEvil winner gets to couch
Yea but TP is sick and I'm probably gonna talk about it a bunch if I'm on chomp for that day so like
Cheer30 this hasn't gotten any use in a while.
@cloudd Damn thought there was gonna be a free for all fight swifFight
yeah I just realized after I sent it lmao
phantom i have finally realized the funniest thing to do in mega man 2
and that is get quick man to half health and then use flash stopper
Yo seed 2 looking really sick rn
watch as his health drains to nothing
@Swiftalu hmm this could also be arranged
seed 2 has been in go mode since day 2 lol
what timezone are you TMZ? Phantom gotta stream at 4 AM that time or somethin lmao
why shoot to death when i can just slow his heart to nothing
okay i lurk cldCry will pop in later if ur still on
i juste hate seed 2 specifically
but maple syrup is HUGE in frozen wastelands
look all im saying is seed 2 doesnt deserve to end
drink options if you're in a frozen wasteland: * vodka * maple syrup
if we can get another seed to end before seed 2 that'll be peak comedy, TMZ
beat all the seeds in number order
all this syrup i think you actually are in canada :P
Is seed 8 gonna be an Ultra Boots locked hammer seed? XD
how many bits are required to make you softlock saving the yoshis? or is that fixed in rando? LUL
the fact i got that after that quote? iceblueChefskiss
We are usch gremlins sometimes. XD
if you're going to SGDQ and want to scare phantom tell them you're seed 6
Sorry i drank it.  Its hot out there.
But then it would be miracle ice?
the miracle is that it isn't frozen
Ok I will stop being a little shit now.
Cheer40 we haven't seen one of these in a while.
damn I was hoping you'd get hit lmao
It was a risk I was willing to take
Quasi-go mode.  Skipping all checks unless they are easy.
its ok only seed 2 bothers me
This ain't one of em tho
his downward falling sprite i think
Cheer50 actually this is more 420
upside down screen would’ve been funny
there's no way to like distort the screen is there?
upside down would be funny lmao.
Sounds more what I imagine shrooms would be like than 420.
just give your monitor a 180, DIY upside down.
Which given Mario would be approprate...
swap 666 wasn't seed 6, I'm rioting. Cheer75
Swapping FROM seed 6 was though
oh hey we're back with seed 1!
I just went back in the vods and you DID indeed start on seed 1.
grimmy1Spike Me after sabotaging the run.
"Good RNG" you said at the time
@Adagorio and that was the last time there was good RNG in the run...
I forgot homeward shroom location manipulation was a thing
can’t you set the homeward shroom location to not toybox?
or is that disabled for this?
you can spend 1000 bits to change the homeward shroom location.
I meant can phantom change it themselves
yeah they can but that'd kinda ruin the thing.
Only if it's like an actual softlock will Phantom change it I think that happened once but I forget
'twas not for lack of trying tho
Have fun when you reach 1k swaps
coincidentally, seeds 1, 2, and 3
Mirby why are we so same brain sometimes? XD
i love the idea of glitchless historical reenactments
it implies some historical reenactments may use glitches
@Darkness3827 dammit I was gonna say something like that
"this battle would have gone differently if the people on the boat clipped under the water past the breath trigger so they could walk underwater and not have to breathe"
going across a body of water? just walk on the seabed like SMS
Never gonna finish a seed at this rate
Cheer75 I can't allow seed 1 to finish before seed 2, sorry
I see you still haven't been able to finish the seed that's been in go mode, gl on day 4
Pride75 as in go away mode
can’t wait for all 10 seeds at the junior fight
To everyone who ke[t quiet about that miracle water, I applaud you.
All or Nothing is dangerous business with shuffle on lol
Sure, I get you a burger! oranLove
Does red jar count as a shop item or a check item?
I didn't hear it, play it again.
i'm gonna take a wild guess
How could I ever forget it after making a comment about it way back when
lmao the game almost sounds like its dying lol
ruins stone skip or toad town sushie glitch? Which do you prefer?
i rather have a ch7 huff n puff then a ch7 general guy
they can’t hurt you without your consent
And you can attack out of it?! That is strong
I mean at that point yeah just use repel gels.
what does wave do to stone cap
Another seed close to finishing oh nooooo
hey @TheMasterZelda what do you get if you take a 5 and flip it upside down?
as long as we don't let seed 2 be the first to finish we're good
that would've been incredible if that swapped to seed 2
ngl i forgot about that fight
need to get to all 10 in go mode before any are allowed to finish
well subs = more work for swift. bits = more money to give to swift.
I still think that message I sent to you was funny
how many minutes before the game shuffles?
oh back to seed upside down 2
hey i'm only 10k away from the VIP one, gotta give you a hard time :D
It's like children changing the tv channel
wow shocking comeback from seed 5
is seed upside-down-2 gonna be the first to finish
just get my power shock luck :)
go mode? more like slow go mode. Cheer100
I like how they change color when they complete the stack
more like L Magikoopa cause he's fuckin dead now.
omg I choked on my spit with that swap
Cheer5 time to get scammed again
Ok. I need different recommendations for desk chairs
yeah I think water block is only -2 for fire attacks.
I have that game with me actually
Vol 2 was the best NBA Street, imo
@buff00n This seed isn't in go mode so no gotta save it for the ones Phantom is about to finish.
I wanted to play it on stream once and then realized COPYRIGHT
NFL STREET > NBA STREET. Outside of the fact that Mario, Luigi, and Peach are playable
Now I wanna watch Space Jam while high...
only played NBA Street, not NFL Street
Same deal with SSX On Tour
I mean SHAQ was an elite player when that game came out so prolly
We could've had Link and Samus in Marvel Alliance if they did pitch them with the PS2 version
There was a Soulcalibur game with Link in it but that's not EA
you too can ring people out with Link's bug catching net, online!
i did that once at a friend's house cause the net does literally no damage lmao
I need Dreamcast games on NSO so I can play Soul Calibur I
why play that when you can go older and play soul edge
Donkey Kong and Bowser are in Skylanders
I love that soundtrack, that's why
that reminds me of when i was planning out what games to play for this board of retroachievements challenge league, and one of the eligible games for a feat of honor is Fighting Street
Saturn on NSO would be a godsend
ooh, cherry bob-ombs. I'm with it
you know, Fighting Street. it spawned a long running franchise. even has the latest entry on Switch 2
@Fiyaball Isn't Saturn emulation SUPER scuffed ?
Hell give me a Saturn Mini; I'd pay $500 for one if it has Panzer Dragoon Saga and Rayearth on it
Saturn is rough af to emulate but it works now
i played most of rayearth for the first board of this challenge league, banger game
Rayearth and PDS are the two hella expensive games I want someday
why play Panzer Dragoon when LAIR exists? :D
Because Saga is a full RPG and it's dope af
yes there is no metroid dread on the tracker, bot
pipe dream, but I wouldn't say no to Phantasy Star Online for NSO
@buff00n only if they bring back the keyboard gamecube controller
@buff00n Only if they re-release the ASCII controller to go along with it.
Altho I think the ASCII controller was for PSO 2 specifically.
no no we had PSO Episode 1-3
those were still PSO1, PSO2 is separate
nvm that episode 3 was suddenly a frickin' card game
I need a second Dreamcast keyboard someday to sucker someone into carrying me in Typing of the Dead
yeah i tried PSO2, i was not fond of how repetitive it was
Yo typing of the dead is fire
like i enjoy FF14 because it has great areas to explore with well designed landmarks
PSO2 was a lot of "this planet's map is randomly generated go here and here to do things"
also House of the Dead 2 has the best voice actor in video game history.
so like none of the areas you went to left any impression
@Darkness3827 "I DON'T WANNA DIEEEEE" "My God."
i think the new genesis revamp has actual areas
which is better but i also didn't vibe with the gameplay much either
That's fair. P3 at least has some non-randomly generated ones.
me when people look at etrian odyssey and go "oh its randomly generated dungeons?" and i'm like... no and they go "so it has no replay value?"
that's kinda why I don't care for roguelites, even when they're good
I'm not into the main draw of a game being a random experience
i don't mind randomly generated dungeons, that's fine. but with an MMO it's about exploring areas with friends around the world and doing story. but if the worlds have no care put into them why would i go there
it's like missing a vital component
with roguelites there's usually a narrative component why the world is constantly changing that i can understand. if it makes sense that's fine. but the ones that don't even bother i usually get annoyed by
like PSO2 gives no reason why the areas are randomly generated they just are
wait does that go back down when you leave?
I enjoyed Rogue Legacy 1 a lot, but 2 added way too many currencies and bloat
oh right you just skipped it
it is perfectly fine if the gameplay loop is having short playthrough but multiple
don't go making a random dungeon in a 100h+ fcking jrpg
You say that and yet Ancient Cave is the best part of Lufia 2
Though it's more a bonus mode
persona 4 i can't get into because of the story, not the dungeons lol
i do appreciate how P5 had proper dungeons while still the randomly generated mementos and a good narrative reason for it.
Well ig the story is worse but the writing is 100x better.
counterpoint: yosuke's a piece of shit
Persona 3 had an excellent character growth with Junpei and then they went "okay let's never do that again"
"here's your likable best friend party member!" he's a homophobic fatphobic slacker, fuck that guy
just play etrian odyssey actual best atlus franchise
and he has an ego too!
bro has nothing going for him to justify him acting like he does
P5 is like fine but suffers the modern RPG problem of they tell you every goddamn thing that happens 50 times in the story and it makes me cry.
isn't there a floor panel at the windmill?
and i hate how people try to excuse yosuke's homophobia as "well he was supposed to be a romantic option but he was cut" cool so it's not canon and thus he's just an asshole lmao
@Mirby_Studios There's cut voiced lines for romancing Yosuke, so I guess he's supposed to be stuck in the closet or some shit?
idk if this is possible but you should make it so your camera is mirrored whenever you're playing a seed that is mirrored :D
literally was just addressing that lmao
Atlus is a bunch of cowards
removing that romance option means he's not in the closet he's just a bigot we're supposed to like cause he's forced on you
Though it might happen in the remake now that the old director isn't in charge
i do have hopes for P4 Revival because, yeah, hashino's gone
P4 also is lame cause you don't shoot yourself in the head or rip your face off to summon personas.
i was told metaphor has a LOT of nostalgia bait reference
Holy shit ch 3 finished real
one of the main reasons i have hopes for P4R is because one of the most blatantly transphobic scenes in the original P3 got completely rewritten and recontextualized in P3R to not even be transphobic at all so maybe they'll fix all that shit in P4
what they replaced that scene with is genuinely funny
@Mirby_Studios this is also my hope
cause he's a macguffin that's why you gotta save him.
that can be solved with flashback scenes but sounds like it doesn't
nah 3 year olds think white people saying slurs is hilarious
hashino is very hamfisted with his writing
RWBY also notoriously handles the topic of furry racism really badly
surface level shit that acts more enlightened than it is
the rabbit people are also treated pretty shittily
The only good one I've seen do it was Fire Emblem Path of Radiance
ok so your typical triple A slops writing i see
@SeventyFourTG Yea game is goated for that one
@SeventyFourTG and by extension Radiant Dawn
So hyped for it to come to NSO
i love radiant dawn so much
my favorite fire emblem by far
i found sacred stone rather boring tbh
I only ever played one FE game and I wasn't really a fan of it lmao. Admittedly I didn't pick a good one (Fates) but allegedly it's awful plot decent gameplay and I felt the reverse with it tbh.
Echoes made me want to break my 3ds
fates is a game of all time
yea it came out super late
fates with the underground thanos sky canyon
My opinion of Three Houses might be more positive than others because I did Blue Lions first lol
i like echoes a lot but gameplay wise it suffer of being fe2
Like 10 times kill them over
It's an enemy, I fucking hate them
radiant dawn has the level of depth that i like while staying simple too
They spawn like 4 enemies every turn that can warp behind you and I was so mad
not having X class Y reclass Z skill
Having played Disgaea before I played FE my feeling with Fates was basically. What if you took Disgaea, and gutted all the fun gameplay mechanics and all the comedy. That's Fates lmao.
"there's a place at the bottom of this canyon i can't speak of because if i do i cease to exist but just trust me and jump down this bottomless canyon with me and you'll see that this canyon isn't underground we're in the sky"
It's a shame Fates is dragged down by horrendous writing because Conquest gameplay wise is genuinely really good
but aside that echoes is pretty solid
they took a very lackluster game and turned it actually pretty good
engage isn't as deep story-wise as more recent FE games like three houses but it's enjoyable. reminds me of GBA-era FE
engage doesn't take itself seriously and i think a lot of people tried to take it more seriously than it did lol
meanwhile me enjoyer of small 3ds
I love how light the wii u gamepad is for how big it was
I'm surprised more DS/3DS games didn't get ported to the Wii U cause I mean the dual screen gimmick is right there...
right back to where we were
it went to seed 2 then TMZ realized and swapped again.
there have been way too many seeds for me to have any ideas about what to do
I was thinking chapter 1 or something
cause I know you already sushie glitched to chapter 3
Trying to set it right again lol
Can you sushie glitch to chapter 2 or is that a fake loading zone for the train? lmao
no jump and no parakarry is crazy
Cheer5 time to unscam myself. It was so long ago I forgot lmao
Never gonna send thee at a good time lmao
Well, the first one should be omega tiny yea
speaking of discord I forgot to post the best voice actor of all time in there :D
I managed to forget my keys while going out for a breathing break outside KEKW
brb cover me for seed 2
luckily had a window to my appartment open, so I was able to climb back in KEKW
I do like this mirror mode btw
did you check merlow for seed 4?
like - really do like it - could be hilarious for rando
Pride69 now it was the right way
If only it could mirror instantly
instead of on the next loading zone
but things are like they should be
you're just playing on the Wii now KappaPride
@Darkness3827 waggle the wii remote to spin then press B to jump KappaPride
you got: Broken Glasses cause you just hammered them you idiot!
Seed 9 gonna be first seed to finish?
I have survived the 3rd of july shift
This day never gets easier each year
stop eating so many Jelly Pops, Yoshi
so how does the 1k bits thing work does it set it to where you currently are
where do you want it the least
end of whatever dungeon is in chapter 7 is probably the worst
Does it set it for all of the seeds
Makes sense but it'd be really funny if it was all lol
for 20 subs you can do that kinda sorta
oh right you still can't flip panels geez
I really hope this works for the train
@RavenFP did you hear about daybreak part 3 Sadge
Anyways I'm 20k bits now that's all I wanted lol
I mean it's better than Chapter 7
@RavenFP coming out in jan cuz switch 2 version ... on a game key card
Oh yea I didnt care ab it cause it already happened for rune factory lol
you can softlock the seed in chapter 7
I'm fine waiting I'm replaying some anyway
set spawn behind the staircase room
And 2 left a bad taste in my mouth it gives me time to move on
if you raise the stairs gg
if you Sushie glitch in will you softlock there?
@RavenFP worst part is falcom share meeting is in dec so time to dodge spoilers once again i heard kai 2 will get announce
Cheer100 Did I just see a slow go!?
I've done fine avoiding all spoilers so far
Only thing I've ever been spoiled on was ending of cs2
And that was my own fault
so earlier it was mentioned here that c++ randos can't work with AP? what can?
@RavenFP i been spoil way too much Sadge
OMG THE ABILITY TO FLIP PANELS!
Cheer131 shadow: slow go Slow Go Yippee weeeeeeeeee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: slow go Slow Go Yippee weeeeeeeeee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: slow go Slow Go Yippee weeeeeeeeee by the bgram
Cheer100 shadow: slow go Slow Go Yippee weeeeeeeeee by the bgram
I had to do 1500 for the 1k so I need to dump the rest
Holy shit, 705 swaps so far
What is this sacred voice I hear, whispering unspeakables to me
Cheer100 glados: here is my shiny song
6 mins for slow go smilers
i mean if you are truly lost i think its fair to check what you missed
check starting partner ig maybe altho I don't remember what any seed started with...
or just do a check and check what that check is
oh my god a seed at final
oh my god a seed no longer at final
wait does AP really ONLY support python? limesDespair
will phantom beat a seed tonight probably not
you're only not allowed to play seed 2
1 and 5 are banned too cause they're too close to finishing.
Bow was your starting partner in seed 6
but default should include location its weird
huh you must be on some weird version or something
if you press alt in the default browser window at the top you should have History->Show All History
idk in pape rando what sphere 6 mean in term of average progression
so more than double usual KEKW
can confirm dark souls is a fishing game
though I dont know if hollow knight has proper fishing?
I think I might need some snooze - room's finally at 20C from having had to try and sleep at 30C catsittingverycomfortablearoundacampfirewithitsfriendswithmarshmallows good fus I wish PrideFlower
one question before I sleep I do have though
would you recommend this to anyone like ever
wait do you need to sushie glitch there again
i'm having fun messin with ya. been watching since like 3pm today
This really is like a tv with different channels with that comment lol
@TheMasterZelda dont you mean its the one you'll shuffle phantom into another 200 times rather then letting them end the first of the seeds KEKW
why do we hate seed 2, cus we're at bowser? KEKW
@Jonxhas no reason, i woke up and chose violence
Seed 1 is on the way to the castle I think
Seed 2 is banned instead of 6
feels like it's been 5 hours since one happened
neighbors already started shooting off fireworks
say it with me folks: IT'S NOT EVEN THE 4TH YET
bro i'm in canada and people are already shooting off fireworks i fucking hate it
there aren't some US islands in the Pacific that are on the ahead side of the date line?
I'm pretty sure everything is EST or later
like idk guam or some shit
Yeah it's 2:15 PM July 4th on Wake Island!
phanto274Eyeroll lmao i just got this
Population of 100 on Wake Island!
either way I would like the cultists to calm down and let us other cultists (witches) and reasonable people vibe in peace
imagine telling people to stop donating to funnee
look i'm only stopping seed 2, every other seed is fine
@FatPidgeyBirb Will Phantom have to chew his arm off to complete the seed?
Phantom how does it feel knowing you've wasted almost 2 full days on these shenanigans?
@Darkness3827 I sure hope they dont, they need that arm!
And they'll stay in go mode until the end LMAO
Seed 2 is on ban tho
me when I don't get dizzy and don't die
Just when you think you're out
just needed some time off to get it
oh hey a go mode seed
want me to unequip it for you?
it'd be funny if there was an option to equip random badges.
but you have the nice number
A randomize badge thing would be funny
You can use an OBS filter on the game,
wait i though it straight up didn't render
It's just at like 95% darkness
I may have the filter saved on my end, want me to see if I can find the settings?
It worked for me, but I was on tink :va
disable speedy spin for 3 hours
you guys know he's gonna have to do pillar clip at some point right
phantom's gonna get back from SGDQ, boot this up, and still not have speedy spin
is what we talked about like 2 hours ago
have you heard tubba chase theme with this
only if the max redeem was only 3 par stream Sadge
Homeward Shroom me once, shame on you. Homeward Shroom me twice, shame on me.
is there a sound to climbing a ladder?
I just came back and put my headset on.  What just happened!!
"Ok I believe you" is also a Kingdom Hearts meme and that makes me happy.  LUL
another top tier line from KH that should get memed on more but isn't is in KH2
i only like kingdom heart 2 the rest is shit
when sora goes "Don't tell me there's more! I'm lost enough as it is"
like how is that line never memed on
when you don't practice before the concert
best KH game is chain of memories
That moment when that one replacement guy didn't come in
it was disabled for at least 30m btw
OH SHIT THIS OST IS BANGIN YO
I LOVE the series but...my goodness are some of the protagonists are aren't spart enough to win a game of tic tak toe while the main villain is doing multi-timelime speed chess.
yeah unlike every other disney world, in KH2 atlantica just... retells the same story. BUT NOW AS A RHYTHM GAME
I counted kinda quickly so +/- like 2 but still basically like 45 minutes
lmao that’s the best way to put it TMZ
Kingdom Hearts 3 is fun.  You get to watch Woody roast the hell out of the main villain and tell him that no one loves him.
you also get to see sully and mike throw another villain through a door and that door through a door and that door through a door and that door through a door then shred the last door
yeetus vanitas is a hilarious scene
the real reason pixar wasn't in KH til KH3 is cause pixar characters do not give a fuck
Dignity and self respect should be there somewhere
idk maybe you were very broke at one point
this is the little tykes my first piano version of the theme
WAIT I KNOW WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOSHI CRAFTED WORLD
You're right we should fix it
this is what hell sounds like
Weird way to spell heaven ngl
looks like she was trying to unscrew it
Okay I'm not buying anymore bits
Okay I think we're closing in on an hour of no speedy spin
I missed the first few days of this. How long did it take for you to disable homeward shroom?
instead we have basic b*tch spin Gladge
it's crossed out on the redeem sheet
ETA of speedy spin at like 42:25 Run time by my calcs
you'll be 42 h 25 m into the run when you get it back
Seed 6 isnthe cursed one of the bunch
the 2nd half of seeds are pretty bad overall
i think i watched that one LUL
1000 should of been like 150 bits
it was like oats doing super metroid impossible with input sabotage KEKW
not seeing any of the star spirits present is WEIRD
well this is gonna be a lot more than 5 parts lmao
4 go-modes plus another 2 that are close
is there a seed where you haven't done it?
is it toad town sushie glitch?
this is a very TP All Dungeons type of trick. Takes like an hour to retry it if you mess it up.
I could of but I have to go to another grocery store for a few things that are on sale
He just wanted to get to the next seed.
shouldn’t matter as long as you’re all the way I think
I remember when you were tryna do that trick without jump lmao
I forgor did you want me to go ahead with finishing the other static sketch or nah (Idr if I got an answer, I finished the others)
It's ok if you don't know rn
SEED 5 IS FINISHING LET'S FUCKING GOOOO
as long as it isn't seed 2 finishing first
you know what’s even better thanks badgeless Bowser? cheer40
oh god berserk with star beam...
or shield I mean yea lmao
oh berserk auto star beams? that's nice!
Go ahead with the latest sketch tho ye?
I wasn't sure which one LMAO
Rest look fire I'll send a sneak peek
That last one turned out to be my fav in the end
you got bowser to nice health lol
Cheer75 Oh no ads, can't have people missing final bowser!
the 2 people with out ads
mondo literally dm'd me to ask help for it LOL
prolly only bout 10-15 min left lmao
well first you have to watch the train again to get back to blue station lmao
isn't that a good thing? Kappa
it's about to be disabled for another 3 hours
I think whenever it switches seeds the one that's next in the queue starts cause the one that's ongoing stays with that seed.
that's prolly why it didn't go the full time
alright, I’m going into sleepy mode, gl for the rest of tonight and surely you’ll beat a seed monadoCope
there is no seed 6 there is only zuul
well at least this seed is almost go mode
How's the multiple runs going? LUL
almost done with a few of em
just found out someone i've known for over 20 years is gonna be at SGDQ
mostly cause one of his games is being ran
Prison City being that game, for clarity
known him from a zelda fan game forum with plenty of in-jokes as a result lol
i met him irl once ever so briefly at MAG 2013 lol
How many seeds total were there?
Pride75 that's for hitting the princess even if it wasn't her
In the middle of the mashing too
it’d be cool if those hallways were randomized if puzzles were set to random
I've never seen this setup skip before.
this is probably a lot easier on a real n64
tutankoopa is looking a little cold
mirby and tmz getting every seed to chapter 8 before a single one finishes:
It's like watching multiple shows at once.
HOLD up refresh care poison HUH
we actually gonna beat a seed HOLD
i heard the low health lol
i could get him killed so easily....
oh shit he gonna heal now
good news is you get the badges back!
the door led to seed 10, interesting
i was thinking the 1st seed was about to be clear Sadge
omega, count how many grains of sand are in this desert
sorry i had to do it
i just couldn't pass on it
i mean that the point of this KEKW
tbf someone could have healed KEKW
tbf i thought you turned on OHKO mode
which a heal wouldn't help with
could be done with half the seed tonight!
Where in the World is the Palace Key?
oh wait i just realized for AP, only the logic part has to be in python, the patcher can be anything really
yea but not having to handle the entire game patching def makes it simpler
brb chat don't let him play seed 2
it would be really funny to have most of the seeds at final bowser and just continually bead his ass in multiple timelines
how’d I put bead in there
imagine all the seed left are at bowser and cheer 500
it's okay, I can't type either
I’m on my phone, I’m not sure if that’s worse
i got @ by aniv once in a random chat i never chatted in
but it felt so weird seeing the @ highlight out of nowhere LMAO
@TheMasterZelda why did I hear this as Snapcube Eggman
back in time to see a seed getting clear COPIUM
Give it up for seed 5
im surprised this status knew to peach beam
im just used to berserk never being good in any game i play KEKW
GET THIS LOSER OFF THE SCREEN
i forced goombario back on screen
i was GOING to swap when bowser had single digit HP but you did more damage than i expected lol
How badly do you want a swap?
this seed is actually just a nightmare that keeps adding
doing a ap rn and my starter is entei POGGIES
@blacktiger51 i hope you play with exp boosts monkaS
mmm arguably still matter for really bad exp curves
me refering to my own doc every other month at work
and my entei sucks ass rn Deadge
way to ruin my joke instantly lmao
he wears sunglasses too, put some respect on his name morphe39Mad
Pride75 don't get used to them
oh look it's jr troopa in bowser's castle
you know what that means right
ty i wasn't paying attention lol
of all the seeds for it to swap too
If Bowser wants to play this game we can play right back
Cheer5 have another full FP boost
bowser isn't used to being cheated back
bowser has the star rod phantom has the chat rod
look it's not as inappropriate as the Vibe Scepter from SPP
to save me on bits obviously
How much do you want to go back to that fight?
Cheer75 Time to send you to another seed
I do have thoughts of sending you to another seed but suffer these ruins first
was it really that bad that you needed to refresh KEKW
it wasn't 2, so TMZ can be happy
does refresh heal all statuses or just poison, i forget
tmz probably wants 2 to be the last seed to finish
Once you finish these ruins or have to swap seeds I might think about sending you to another seed
shoutouts to rigby pioneering feeling fine strats on final
he might have been the only one to do that KEKW
The seed we finally have the HOLY BOOTS
the fact this seed could still require sushie glitch is....
and para to cross some specific gaps
i though this was seed 2....
honestly a busted star power, it only sucks vs literally bowser
my entei finally learn a new move defense curl Deadge
ok that funny i found my magical seed on a berry check in pokemon KEKW
that will never not be funny
Have to properly return to that seed to give you credit for the 2nd seed
Funny thing is I will be doing Yu-Gi-Oh today in search for 2 cards
Sky Striker Ace- Zero and Sky Striker Maneuver- LemnisGate
My sister is in Japan right now and getting me a mat of Sky Striker
also i missed the intended timing for that swap cause maddy wanted to knockout tour lol
i taught them the first turn skip in DK pass
his problem is he keeps getting pushed to the side in these seeds
Is this a cry for HP and FP?
i mean if you are to complain about it
you’ve technically still not beaten seed 3 yet, right?
I accidentally put an L at the end and autocorrect decided to do whatever
Cheer75 not seed 2 but lol
wonder if swap 777’ll take you to seed 7
feels like 666 was 10m ago
This old koopa flushed his glasses down the toilet. LUL
i got MM recomp all setup
that toad watching you phase through the wall
I know nothing about MM but it opens the door for another AP
i like I can play it in ultra wide, cant wait to do that with banjo kazooie
4 panels, on the ground, and letter?
dont ask me, Ive never played this game KEKW
faster travel via map would be so cool
could it be a multi coin block?
I wonder what ancient soda taste like? Dust? Probably dust.
And most likely eating one to 7 meals together
I'd be down for top golf
I did top golf with lai when she visited
Nah it took very little to make the animation, I'll have to see how the stripes go lilaggSmile
i probably won't be going out much, i generally don't at events
like the most i'll be doing is meat sweats with ice
Meanwhile, in a galaxy far far away
everyone being right on seed 2 warms my dark blackened heart ✨
who knew your boots were under your feet the whole time? phanto274Notes
Sandals are mostly under your feet, yes
yea just straps so it doesnt fall
Goombaria why do you have that? LUL
where does homeward shroom go on this seed
taking a trip back to the stars
Did you get Kolorado Tree? :v
Wow you weren't kidding about some 100% rando play throughs being inevitable
mario kart world has special animations for characters seeing the blue shell attack them
what if you wanted to finish another seed
I love how he looks like Santa in this seed
Oh wow his name is Rip Cheato
Everytime I hear Cheato I think of Cheato from Banjo Kazooie and especially Tooie
Laki has food poisoning but he's fine
JCog made eggless chocolate chip cookies and they were so good
I haven't had an eggless cookie in over a year
that's what I would say if you got dizzied
I got a pow block drop for you right here PantsPinch
Oh it's seed6 my favorite one
Cheer75 go back to seed 6 pls scuffedCry
Is the homeward shroom still the choochoo train
Oh wtf one was it on lol
It's my first time, go gentle on me 😩
damn, did the edible kick in
when your copy of the game came from a very weird shop
why spin when we can jump? phanto274Mash
Ok can we start over now so we can get that again
I have when I watched someone do botw hundo their first time
So we could've had 44:44:44 on seed 4 with 4 seeds completed
Watching nukie do it is cool
But she's also just goated at that shit now so it's way under 44 hours lol
More than very good, she has pushed in massive amount of hours into it
It sends you to seed 6
did you save stanley on this seed
I can't contribute to the cause now
Now I gotta save stanely whoever that is
Imagine if we had 444 swaps too. LUL
He just wants to hit you really really hard
Goomba space program, the Mario flavored sequel to Kerbal Space Program
Also, Mamar with star storm is funny
oh did u need that? I ate it
maybe the real palace key is the friends we made along the way
Seed 4 is being very stubborn.
the palace key was the sushie glitches we did along the way
its gonna be the biggest trade sequence you've ever seen
The palace doesn't exist. Palace key is just a myth.
ok glitch hunters time to find palace key skip
(that's me i'm a glitch hunter)
Cheer5  Have this to help out
that's not who we just murdered
Imagine if they made a seed where if you defeat one boss, it weakens the other boss linked to it. Kinda like a soul link.
imagine if all these had deathlink
next time you should do this you should play it on AP while I occasionally just death link murder you in whatever game I have
It would very quickly turn into "Gee why is phantom only streaming when I go to work"
is the shuffle multiple instance of bizhawk or a single one?
To get you to finish another seed
yea don't see how that could work with AP too well
I'm glad this seed has all important partners
Cheer25 you said no life shroom right?
Can you homeward shroom after :)
its like the one fight goombario can't do anything KEKW
Just giga partner Goombario he'll become immune
It would just be me making you goombario fight
what about a "swap to goombario" redeem
could break the game with sushie no?
every party member is now goombario
Dont forget to homeward shroom to skip the fight :)
The swap said, "There are other ways to escape. We have the technology."
do you know why specifically bizhawk and pretty much only bizhawk is so desync prone for AP? haven't had any issue with other emulators
that's fine, was asking just in case
didn't know it was a thing ty for showing it off
holy shit seed 6 has come a long way
its not even inside the castle lol
i guess it truly is your lucky day
what level is he scaled at
10 bits to get rid of this child
yeah i just added the third
one of my favorite moments has been the swap to a single desert bandit and you just went "WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU"
i still think its absolutely crazy how chapter 3 has you against enemies that setups +6, like yea i get its to make you use bow but still its crazy
beating up kids and old persons uh
Pride75 who said you could clear a third seed
surely there's a laki clip here Clueless
so glad seed 2 is cancelled
thanks for the welcome bits, bit leader
Damn why the hate for seed 2
i worked from 7 AM this morning and went to streaming around 8 pm until now so im heading to bed
there actually is no reason KEKW
completion is often the enemy of crowd control shenanigans lbr
I did send the spam over finally
Discord really hates art apparently today
Yea they do have an ai bot 🫠
what's gonna be discords next downward spirals
I think I’ll head to bed myself. thanks for the super long stream phantom. have a good night and I hope you sleep well
I just needed to adjust the eyes a little bit
no problem. I enjoy listening to the chaos
Would you believe me if that was 12 fps etchyPain
its all about them key frames
12 and 18 fps are based frames per second tbh
Goompa's warcrimes in Bowser's Castle is sus
I PUT THE SWIFT IN SWIFTALU
It's literally cause I've just been drawing for so long so I've become efficient
the longer we work on our skills the faster they improve this is tru
time to bring up the obs filter
that was how bright the desert actually is
Ice how are you supposed to enjoy salmon if you can't see it
seed 6 is like seed 2 but not at all in any way shape or form
I will temporarily regain vision for salmon
why spin when you can jump? phanto274Mash
Btw begging twitch to add apng
the hit sequel to KIRBY'S FUCKING PISSED
at least berserker Mario’s smart enough to peach beam
finally back to a good seed
You know what because of that
Stage Lights set to max volume
It's pseudo-freedom but freedom nonetheless. LUL
what a terrible spot for watt
seed 4 truly is the scavenger hunt for a key
Find the key in the needle stack
calling it now, its the one check left in tubba castle
or was that a different seed
The amount of time it takes to organize files is a crime
I have to carefully size it and convert it by hand lol
just put it in the /temp/temp/temp folder
i'm actually putting efforts into organizing files on this pc and haven't made a temp folder yet
now my old pc... lets not talk about it
it was nice! just did a tutorial on a speedrun tonight
and yeah! i finished on Monday!
As it turns out that was not too bad, I can't wait to take that again in the future and then immediately regret it swifNice
I called it, "Learn a Fast" or LAF ohheyi30Hehe
@BeamQueenSol Maybe have been an animation, can't say for certain
nice tracker for a sec there KEKW
or wait, C is the moan, right?
The fucked up music gets me every time
I was not expecting that at all
seeing 99 star points on the final boss is painful
chat, pop the eddie on the soundtrack
It's a bid to keep you alive right now. LUL
The music is killing me so much
this is what we came to see
next time on Dragon Ball Z ass
We'll be right back after these commercial messages
I really think it’s lava basement
Yo that's what I do in minecraft
inb4 the key is in here
How much does this seed rival seed 6
this used to be a worse seed than seed 8
it had all partners but no boots
"die! stupid child... just die" new quote ichimaiaPoint
dang that child grew old real fast
its ok we found out all kooper does is let you beat chapter 7
don't have to sushie glitch at least
you skipped a mushroom in water room
can seed 9 finish before seed 2? stay tuned
just grab some from your backyard idk
Wait, is phanto274Jam meant to be a Kirby 64 reference?
Oh I know, I'm (too) familiar with the animations.
One day I might commission Swift. If only to see how she'd end up doing my vee.
and you didn't have to back the potato salad kickstarter to get it
Japanese potato salad is my favorite potato salad
Korean potato salad is similar to Japanese potato salad
wow and now he's following you?!? rude
drugs and soda? that's a winning combo
get rid of your cottonmouth here too
I was thinking the same thing ohheyi30Hehe
i'm gonna run up to phantom at SGDQ and say "hi i'm seed 2" then just run away
sounds like Michael Scott trying to play the steel drums PrideLaugh
as does the action command meter
yea its a different notification you have to listen i think
that's the seed i tried to heal you on i think lol
Yeah I don't think TMZ is letting you complete this
nah i'm just stalling to reduce chances to go back to seed 2
@TheMasterZelda you do know that berserker Mario peach beams, right?
High key most entertaining crowd control I've ever watched
it really is the mental play is real
Something about having to mentally keep track of 10 diff seeds at all times is entertaining as hell
my bsky notifs are about to explode
jocat was talking about fantasy races and their equivalents in MMOs and i misread high elves as thigh elves and commented as much
cause that's a damn funny misread lets be honest
he even quote posted "Yo if there are any thigh elves out there hmu" lmfao
wait you just forgot this side of pink station?
All my homies love seed 6
swift you don't know all the shit this seed had KEKW
yeah you don't have to sushie glitch everywhere anymore
also posted a relevant gif to this event in your memes channel lmao
oh boy i love doing a coinflip 5 times after doing a frame perfect floating point perfect trick
you could go until seed 1 is beaten but TMZ is preventing that like it was actually seed 2 in disguise
yea its so annoying when that happens
why did you pick that up
yeah but then you could've come back and went "oh right ew"
excuse me, is this the right dungeon for this area?!?
wow we were here for more than half a second
i love how you get silent whenever seed 2 comes around KEKW
teach me your ways levitating shy guy
shy guy of the toy box tell me your wisdom
it really is gonna be the tubba check isn't it
there's like 5 checks left KEKW
tomorrow is the day for sure :P
you get NOTHING! you LOSE! GOOD DAY SIR!
try to finish seed 1 before TMZ shows up
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
@Mirby_Studios gonna keep a tab open SMILERS
surely you beat this tomorrow COPIUM
hopefully we get to finish a seed today
oh cool the new fire red ap skip the intro
oak ask you after you pick your name what your starter and give you the list of 3
most likely cuz you can start in a random town
It's here we're so back phanto274NBPride
also fuck bizhawk 2.10 i deleted it back to 2.9
Quick swap to seed 2 before TMZ gets here
KILL THE BOWSER, TAKE HIS CASTLE
Hello Mr. Phantom, the most Phantom of all the Phantoms, unless there is another Phantom who is 5801 or more
GIVE IT UP FOR SEED 1
No randomized music with randomized pitch? Is this even a real run?
ugh updated my pop tracker and now my fire red tracker is gone
I should have asked @TheGlubbers too
Voting for this in the next Rando League season
@TheGlubbers Did you end up shopping for ergonomic desk chairs or anything at all or no?
i got an office chair from a liquidator
Or was it just a basic chair?
Wasn't Jcog working on inverted controls?
But what if it was seed 2 that finished
That's right it was Chaos mod I forgor
i was in a work call the last 30m NAHHH
Ok. so I am basically between two chairs at the moment and I'm trying to decide which one to go with
Finally, a button on D Pad down
Ninji is in this game I forgor
They got the nips out with this color
The first one is $500 and has forward tilting and back support but no built in foot rest. The other one is $350, has less tilt, but a footrest
any mirrors you need taken care of this afternoon? 🤜 🪞
oh no is seed 4 the one that's needed CP Key for a while?
I feel like the tilt would be helpful to have because I tend to lean when I read a lot, but if it's not enough it'd be nice to have the rest
this is like, the ultimate training against seed bleed
oh shit i have shopsanity on cant buy normal items Deadge
@Icebound777 and a couple seeds with 1 items 👀
maybe a weird cutscene thing or somethin i'm sure it's fine lol
Cheer69 i may have just done this to myself then lol
it was right before a rosie cutscene too
i mean he's already so little, can he really be smaller?
So who did you wank it to
i heard it the other day, i had no idea LUL
i haven't played any of those games so i it tracks
Motherfucker you're the rat bastard not me
Most I got is how it was going on this
I still remember the tiniest bit but I remember
would hammer 1 even unlock ANYTHING
Was the map displaying checks recent?
No wonder I've never seen it yet
I mean you could've fucked up in a race
I don't think racers pick up enough unneeded items for the map to help any
Let the man finish a seed
3 more than when I fell asleep last night
I HAVE TO GO TO MOBILE TO CHEER
I'm gonna put a cookie up your ass for saying that
Tubba keeping all the good stuff in the guest room
i have the cheer pretyped on mobile i'm ready
cmon go for the heal record
GIVE IT UP FOR SEED 10
Can't wait for the seed swap while you're still in this
You got so close to having it happen tho lol
Only for TMZ to kill you
TMZ about to spend everything to swap you from seed 9
nah my goal is to prevent seed 2 from finishing
you do realize you can’t stop the go mode seeds
and then TMZ will have to spend to stop seed 9 from finishing too
The seed 2 was the friends we made along the way
i'm not an enemy i just really hate seed 2
my dream is seed 6 finishing before seed 2 <3
You don't have a hammer broooo 😭
then I wonder when seed 9 reaches Final Bowser if your mind will change on that
@Rgamer0 may cheer a few 20 because its cheap and its funny
oh hey, did seed 1 finish?
there's a few underdog seeds that would be fun to see finish
spending those sweet 10s and 5s to get it past the finish line
Maybe one day seed 8 will reunite with hammer
chat, shuffle their seed and pop the soundtrack eddie, thanks
surely toy box has a few of these
seed 8 can now progress more in toy box
but CAN you beat seed 8 without a hammer?
damn, that was soon as Mario touched the ground. excellent timing
the mvbow had boots in one seed
all the seeds will have the key before seed 4
I still think "set HP to 1 / 2" is way too cheap. Getting Mario killed is rather easy
on the offhand, healing is also cheap, and life shrooms
you're gonna do this AGAIN ? ? ?
Phantom's into that kinda thing, huh
... did you fix the magical seeds on the tracker?
Idk with everything being so cheap it encourages people to do it more if you think about it swifCurse
idk who i'm fighting but i know it's someone
seed4 is being a real seed6 right now tbh
wait that means its guaranteed to be kooper shell or calculator
trade sequence for key may be real
gonna lurk cuz I'm seeing 7.4
throwing bones sounds like another way to say making it rain
they had to watch you kill that koopa and NOT let them out Sadge
My monitor is far from me so I need to lean in lol
this one is just hard to see in dark mode
Hunch over like the artist I am
ugh this seed WOULD be mirror mode too
btw idea for your next mass shuffler rando. make it AP
@stalkor its a bit of a challenge because of dc/desync
ooo that'd be a fun one
and a not mean one LUL
it would be possible but its rather difficult
technically they need to be all connected
if its all the same game it wouldn't be TOO bad
@stalkor yea that's not possible with bizhawk shuffler
i know oot still uses it's own client, but most games just use bizhawk client
BizHawk Client disconnects every time the ROM changes iirc
different client you could set it up to it reconnect on shuffle
lots of trial and error too
i may delve into it a bit this weekend tbh
For games that use different clients, though, I'm also aware of a program that shuffles arbitrary windows
but since my use case is between different emulators it wouldn't be for the bizhawk shuffler
the shuffler you use is bizhawk specific right?
yea there's another shuffler that works on processes instead
for sure, will prob look at both
God, how are arduino's so sick
I feel like they're so useful for so many things
arduino are amazing for homemade projects
Uni friend reprogrammed a guitar hero drum kit to work with rock band through an arduino
i had a college class with arduino it was so cool
oh its an arduino? i didn't know it was specifically that
that kind of thing is so interesting to me
Sorry randomly catching up. But your thing with the monitor and leaning @swiftalu is why I'm trying to find a chair that also leans forward :)
Oh it's just cause my monitor is small, laptop moment
i know it would be technically possible to do a shuffler on real 3ds hardware rather reasonably with homebrew
But until it starts hovering I think the chair is the best solution
just the shuffle would take a bit since it would need to save stuff to drive
Didn't know Bombette worked there, I think jump does too
and vram could also be an issue
but the 3ds natively support process switching and pausing
not gonna let you finish seed 2 Mhm
you also left stuff at the beach :p
wait this seed is pretty close to go mode lmao
coin bags also replenish. is nicer than having to haul replenishing shrooms to some shop
I did not know you could hammer bones away
All the paper mario homies left sixeFeels
Spreadsheet would help with this :)
it would be really funny if its just sitting in a random shop
Time to check spoiler log after that
I've been back about two weeks, but haven't been on Twitch in a long time
as soon as I got back from Japan I went to the East Coast for a week
got back from that on Monday
oh hey back to seed 4
So long as it is not seed 2
For years I forgot this dark area existed because basically every speedrun skips it
seed 6 with the based quick change
No need to pick up thrown chest items either. The collection flag is tied to the chest opening
what's that Phantom? Couldn't hear you
i was in a work call zfgNoDude
Seed One managed to finish because I pushed it past the finish line with my 10s and 5s
2 does not exist for the purposes of this discussion
we just need TMZ to get a work call again, obviously
that Mario will get a burned moustache
i slept too much and now its gonna be tough sleeping tonight lol
it'll be more like a nap tonight
i gotta be up at 5:30am lol
i guess it wasn't fine all along :P
can't wait for seed 2 to be the last seed and for TMZ to spam 75 bits that do nothing
i will be satisfied if seed 2 is the last seed
who the hell did the bot just ping lmao
what a series of screen transitions
Was.... was that your homeward shroom warp??
yea i think they should be swapped
I see Quizmo so rarely at the docks
Reminds me that the southern TT map also has the quizmo code. IIRC he just isnt set up to spawn there, weirdly enough
i'm sure it's not feasible at all, but forcing mario into a quiz with bits would be hilarious lol
Quizmo isn't a transition though. Mario stays right where he is
he probably can only work in specific areas
well, actually, pape64 doesn't use the mem pack
I think we could force NPC interaction at a distance
but in that way, you enter an area and get accosted by Quizmo
Doesn't help for quizmo since you can say no ...
not if you can't say no though HahaThink
but maybe you could do something like "flag that enemy as first-striking Mario now"
force enemy encounter on next load
Oh actually the Star Rod debug ROM allows triggering arbitrary battles at any time. I wonder how that is done
if someone changes the seed i'll shave my head
jokes on you i'm already shaving it @Mirby_Studios lol
you have not impugned your own honor
i do a lot of things, but impugn isn't one of 'em
first seed of the second half at bowser pog
crazy it's finishing before a few of the 5 and under ones haha
i heard seed 4 is the new seed 6 but phanto274Shrug
@RvPA nah its nowhere near as bad but its super funny
because its basically a hundo seed
when you got the beat down but forgot the notes
So I signed up to do racing for FF6 rando. It's actually a pretty cool thing they got it's like a beginner tourney where you get a mentor to teach you stuff and then you race all the other beginner players. It'll be the first time I've done any sort of racing for randos lmao so wish me luck with that :D
i love when they message like HI I AM COMING WITH YOUR ORDER PLEASE GIVE ME EXTRA TIP I NEED IT I HAVE 30 CHILDREN ALL STARVING I NEED MONEY GIVE FIVE STARS BLESS
or the "i've arrived" ok just ring the doorbell????
tbf tho it does have its uses, like when they don't have something i asked for so they're asking what i want instead. that's fine
i just wish it was like only used for that
or the extremely rare case of when the no contact delivery person knock at the door and WAIT
i'm like, please just leave KEKW
drives me nuts when that happens
you know what's just as bad
i'll even give you extra tip just leave KEKW
when they leave the food DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOUR DOOR
sounds like it's the door's fault tbh
like i know you have a brain, maybe put it just far enough away from the door that i can OPEN IT A LITTLE
i've had one time they knocked at my back door and i was like HUH
where's the other 2 items then
could they be unreachable locked behind each other?
yeah I didn't know if that was all checks or just necessary ones.
i want to see a super metroid no logic Kappa
I think pausing the emulator might pause it?
that'll make for a nice outro or maybe a nice intro who knows.
Or you could pause the scriupt too
emulator pause looks like it's worked
laundry moved and just brought food back up
they really only gave me 4 sauce packets? And it's one of each KEKW
classic taco bell doordash experience tbh
Let’s grind those Miyu points LETSGORON
she has TP Any% in a GDQ event on 9/11
what's wrong with the date? Kappa
the avocado chicken ranch tacos are so good, I can't wait for taco bell to cut them from the menu
Wait they’re good but you want them cut? KEKW
taco bell constantly introduces new things for a few weeks and cuts them
they even introduced a deal that is "the current rotation item, a taco and a drink for $8"
AD after I finish this shuffler COPIUM
(as I click the run 3 minutes of ads button)
@Midnaliin cause he ate it all
Tbh yeah I’ve done that KEKW
There’s so many fortress keys holyy
freeedom  and mainly here to say haii and gn   have funs
Everytime it switches I think it’s crashing lmao
omg you don't have to do pillar clip on this seed! I didn't realize that was allowed LUL ...or well that seed now that it's gone.
I haven't seen rando in a hot minute, the map with the number of checks listed is COOL
Yeah I decided I was saving for that ever since I joined your stream lol
my goal is now to beat you to 100k
i was SO confused for a moment
you can do it seed 9
lmao seed 2 is being bullied so hard
seed 2 should have finished on day 2 lol
Which seed beats final first, 2 or 9
oh finally I'm here for a gamba. Just take my points
tmz could just bet on seed 2 and let you beat it Kappa
140k on seed 2. Just take it, lol
im not betting on this one
Sure it's a gamba that can be influenced but sometimes those can be fun too :)
I'm never gonna use them anyway, may as well donate em
i bet 30k on seed 9
Phantom needs to come up with a 1 million point redemption for Tiger lmao
Both are in final which is why the gamba
Why isn't Seed 4 an option
Was seed 4 also entering final?
seed 4 has a warp really close to chapter 8
wait was seed 4 the one that was stuck behind the toybox wall
seed 4 was the one that was looking for Palace Key for like 20 hours
oh wait the pipe is at the castle i forgot
better poll option. What will finish first? Seed 2 or seed 6? lmao
if it gets lucky its totally possible
Or like.. whats the win con here LOL
3 outta 10 have been beaten
Phantom has to beat all 10
one of them is in purgatory
Yeah I was gonna ask about that lmao
swift seed 6 is almost in go mode ichimaiaPoint
Seed 8 needs the palace key and a stone
what happened 1st seed 2 clear or tmz run out of money
Stone isn't needed but would make things easier
and we're back to our regularly scheduled seed 8
I got a two second glimpse of seed 2
Cool 5 seconds of seed 2
bowser was laughing cause he knew it was about to swap away
2nd half of seeds truly is the gift that keeps giving
Hey it's that thing I drew
Time to make a plando for Phantom that forces them to use Hammer Throw and all the other trash badges.
Imagine if that was the hammer
If only the dialogue still existed for that
I forget, is it also this game or just TRYD where there’s also alternate text for doing the same to Whacka?
Cheer50 gotta fix the music before it goes away
I remember the remake has dialogue for it
This sounds like the Crazy Bus theme now LUL
But like if the Crazy Bus theme was good
Where is bombette and kooper in this seed
SEED 6 ENJOYERS WHERE YOU AT
i'm gonna say "hi i'm seed 2" then run away
Nah but what I will find funny is when you come back from gdq and have no idea what was last happening in all the seeds left
Took it right away from you
Which means someone is going to swap you soon most likely
I thought you beat bowser earlier
Never seen them beat bowser, never will
no even seeds allowed or some shit idk lmao
And here we go someone is about to spend another 75 soon
Is there a cooldown on the swap
cheer 500 time at that point
The fact the exact thing you said would happen happened
Should just redeem everyone's points and have 3 options up for which seed will beat Final Bowser first
shit I just noticed the gamba phanto274D
you might if a certain someone keeps setting you to 1HP
there i finally got a swap with bowser just about dead
So you're telling me there's a chance
unfortunately I had to sleep before it happened but there was a troll thing I wanted to do before the first seed finished but I won't do it in case somebody did already
or maybe I will do it who knows lmao
I was gonna switch seeds after you killed Final but before you grabbed the Star Rod the ultimate block LUL
oh yea where was 4’s palace key?
the fifth is for tutankoopa’s private room
apparently that post was already deleted i think
Please for the love of god people do not ask ai for any sort of emotional advice
"No ai tool is a replacement for your voice" while it is literally writing everthing for you so yes, it is
hope that guy get replaced by some random ai shiruHAH
I forget if it was fake or not (it was probably fake) cause it's been a while but I remember seeing a headline about "AI tells recovering meth addict to do meth as a reward for like having a bad week or some shit like that"
TBF 7 years for a MMO that still needed 3 more years of development is insane
they closed a studio that was contender for GAME OF THE YEAR
and sold like x10 expected numbers
@TheMasterZelda which game, I don’t remember
microsoft really needed that money for AI
Microsoft is likely pulling a SEGA
That is most likely getting out of the games industry
"pulling a SEGA" implies sega decided to do it freely instead of being forced to to survive
but yeah, it's definitely a similar situation lol
what happens to the prediction if seed 4 beats seeds 2 and 9
I'm assuming those extra star pieces come from quizmo?
Oh god he has 15 in total
Back at it again with 7 seeds left to go! phanto274GL
I like how the ground underneath just breaks now. LUL
oh damn seed 4? Okay get it phanto274Chef
You found the infamous Seed 4 palace key! PogChamp phanto274Hype
From one Bowser to another Bowser LUL
So who bet on Seed 9
phantom do you have a way to discern between natural shuffles and those we paid for
cause i'm wondering what there's been more of
The fight is over, but the seed is not until we touch the rod of stars.
Don't have to perform the ruins trick on this seed
So leaves a Tubba key and water and 2 partners
GIVE IT UP FOR SEED 9
wait there's still one with no hammer phanto274D
Just a palace key away on key 8
The return of where's muh palace key
This is the longest I've seen it
behold it in all it's glory while you still can Swift
what took you so long TMZ
i removed the cheer from my clipboard KEKL
Okay new prediction, Seed 6 finishing or Seed 2
Since TMZ wants Seed 6 to finish first
you use a clipboard for that? skill issue
Seed 6 is has been a problem child too so if it finished before seed 2...
Seed 10 just needs some water and a Kooper and a Tubba key
10 needs 3 items to finish
Watt power up right when you need it
The question is do you play Pape again for 3 months after this KEKW
guess seed 9 won at 1.1 mil
estimated run time "idk lmao 3 days"
"listen, it will be fun for everyone if the whole even is the shuffler"
Yeah it's not really really really REALLY long a thon
Okay I didn't know that, you're in the ballpark then
I got a couple masks I think
Definitely not the greatest attempts but just how it is some days
Seed 6 stans are in shambles
They got mint baileys at gdq
cant wait for shots at GDQ
I was like damn this thing you're doing is going on for a long time
though tbf i'm more partial to mixed drinks
Ok well good luck taking that on the plane
just something i can sip on over the evening
power flex, drink the entire bottle in front of the TSA agent
only if you don't piss until then
i mean.. part of it will make it with you
Who's to say it would all come out in one piss?
So again seed 10 is the farthest away from reaching go
OMG THE DUMB EMOTE I MADE LMAO
how is that and emote KEKW
He would sleep through these fireworks
7 and 8 each need one item to hit go
Should have a bit redemption that forces you to fight Jr. Troopa
where you are, immediately enter a fight with egg
15 is weak, 20 is where its at
Yeah I could get behind 2 more weeks of this tbh
I mean you did get paid like $250 for it lmao
There is a reason I've streamed daily for the last 18 days
Who was it this time that has kept it going
Those are the people trying to lose fingers
Some guy was driving around with an american flag attached to the back of his truck today
Nothing says america quite like that
I would say what would say Mexico but A) you can't find it as often and B) stereotypical
IS IT MONADO, YOU LIVED HERE ONCE
If they like Nascar there, it's the south
Is this the first seed where we have not used the skip?  Pog
Virginia is above that and is still considered a southern state lol
It was part of the Confederacy
I can confirm I have a friend in West Virginia and they absolutely have a southern culture there.
amazing I was hoping for that when i saw multibounce
random aside, I was shocked how many good rando racers didn't know Huff's turn order for attacks
Like Adam and somebody else didn't and I was watching them race and was like HUH
I'm sorry I had to call you out on Huff
The brain just forgets "Hey, this is scripted fight"
okay good Mhmm that makes more sense
👀 alright, which seed got let through
I also don't like fighting Huff in general
Money is better than Kooper monadoNote
the continued banning of 2 fuels me
oh right I forgot you were doing that earlier too
i noticed bowser hp its time to consider killing mario
I was honestly waiting for it to swap mid trick again
I love both cake and pie
I think Mario is going to die
if you said that you had a pie to eat, and it was cheesecake, people would be sorely disappointed
YALL GONNA LET THE SEED GO THROUGH?
see you wouldn't have been able to do that without berserker Kappa
i am at exactly 666 bits lmao
Yeah you should have been done 20 hours ago surely Kappa
what are you planning on doing to celebrate 1000 swaps uvu
only another 54 hours to go
half the seeds are done- time to add more clearly
OOOOOh Oh living on a prayer!
I can't help it, they do it at too many sporting events
I am nothing but Pavlovic monadoYesHoney
I mean this will be faster once you get all the star spirits
You think you can stick a raccoon on someone's ass?
I'm sure a drunk Canadian has tried before Pichu
I'm guessing at the very least a skunk fits
I have never actually watched it
Letterkenny seems funny from what few bits I've seen
How many seed are just needing dirt for go mode
Did you manage to do clippy?
I should give it a try some time
Both 6 and 8 need dirt go mode
But I also know people who talk like that so sometimes it's a bit too real KEKW
I go "damn that could've been me" phanto274S
It's not simple like the spiked Goomba
There's only 5 seeds now, surely you don't have to go by the map now Kappa
Time to get some bit badges designed? 👀
lemme guess, seed 2 still hasn’t finished?
i have no special sub badges cause i have no idea either lol
so 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 are done
Yeah I always admire people who have good ones, no clue what to do either
Didn't know if there was another war
screw it lets see if we get it again cheer500
there i got a heal in for seed 2
JUST LIKE THE DAY I LOST IT
yeah beat seed 2 why don't you
a few minutes left i think
What did you find to help with the darkness?
10 or 2, only seeds left in the eyes of he bot
The amount of times it's swaped between 10 and 2 is unreal
new question: will tmz burn another 5 gifted to try and kill seed 2 again?
Can't miss the camp tree with the hammer if you don't have it jcogThink
the double swap to bowser’s lightning
If you block it does it do 98?
you should add a heal enemies redeem
Should just get it with the laki jump since you'll need him soon anyways LUL
Rosie is horrid, holding Kooper's shell hostage Madge
so seed 8 is the new seed 4
oh, where was the thing you needed in 4? Shy Guys at blue station?
with the addition of the hammers that is
the fact seed 2 has been on the bowser fight for basically 7h is awesome
can someone explain what is happening. Haven't been here for a while
i'll accept the disgrace of typo
are you gonna come back to this after GDQ?
i swear its always either key or dirt
but the people with bits are a buncha haters /pos
@FatPidgeyBirb only for seed 2 nyacinthsEvil
I love how these things play out, because a buncha viewers just choose evil inconvenience on one (1) specific thing most times
I heard we wanted to go fast
wait Kooper behind a KSJ? classic
4th of july festivities at last over time to enjoy some grind shuffle rando
Did I just walk into marcoMode
Hiya Phantom hope you've been having a good time with the shuffler piplikeWave
That sounds neat, most of this goes over my head to be entirely honest but oh well
even knowing Pape p well this is very intense
In fairness same can be said for the cast majority of streams I watch phanto274Smile
i still think seed 4 was really funny
What's your beef with seed 2
the beef with 2 is just funnee
It's funny but up to a certain point
yes, until every other seeds have finished
no, Phantom's in trouble when multiple seeds are on Final
that's when the real chaos will reign
aaa the calm seeds between the seed 2 wars
I mean we have to do the Bowser fight all over again
When seed 2 comes up it's like that image I sent you earlier in dms
It wouldn't be fun if we didn't let Phantom breathe once in a while
Because we died in seed 2
I think that there was a heal yeah
u rite there should just be a singular bolt
The king stole my huff puff!
i love when it bleeds over another seed KEKW
does unequip all badges work in battles lol?
Yeah putting you into peril is actually a benefit
which is why 25 is 2 hp instead lol
Less than 24 hours 👁️ 👄 👁️
alright, gotta do bedtime with kids. Hold it down.
I been bullied today because someone stole my ice cream
She shuffle my seed till I Final Bowser for 7 hours
I’m helping you by not waking them :)
Seed 8 needs the Palace Key
Seed 8 the underdog for no hammer
we love and appreciate seed 8
what is necessary to go to bowser's castle?
Just find which dungeon entrance leads to it
cause I remember before being confused that you went there with only 2 spirits
That is some fuck ass timing
Anyways twitch asked if I wanted to send that message
what happens if you don't star beam bowser when he uses his shield? does he just merc you on his turn after you don't star beam?
@Darkness3827 you cannot damage him on final
"no twitch i must overrule ya, there is nothing with my message"
don't spend 200 bits to set health to 0
@oblobb they swap out the seed
oh yeah nothing is working lmao
TMZ this is your fault for spamming lmao
chaos'd a bit too close to the god koopa
40 would also be a good choice
Probably have to reset the fight
So basically it's just a seed shuffle
Might be because of a dono war for HP and no HP
the timing is likely just very small
So in essence both me and TMZ broke the script
time to start playing with a dpad instead monadoYesHoney
lava piranha at high scale sounds awful
only rivaled by General Guy tbh
i think you just beat that area
I'd love to stick around but my phone will melt if I stay on Twitch for long enough on it piplikeSleepy take care folks
they're still going off here 😩
I have feelings about that game
oh we found a mirror seed
@TheMasterZelda Yo wtf when did Shiru get that
I'm so outta the loop lol
shiruWAPOW shiruHop shiruPride shiruWave along a few animated emotes
fr she's been working hard at it
hopefully every seed finish before 2 ichimaiaPray
@Swiftalu from a scale 1 to 10, how much has Mario Kart World hurt you
yea this boss in particular often has emulator issue
Why do I help when I hinder and hinder when I help.
your welcome I got them earlier but I took a shower and couldn’t use them
INCORRECT. it is an unga bunga thing to do!
I...don't think I've ever seen that attack.
I don't even remember that casually playing several years ago
now he can’t kill you lol
oh that's what the weird sound is
I've still got 20 bits left, let me know if you ever need a peril.
someone keeps doing a mortar and it shakes the whole house
me trying to hint luigi mansion north rec room key and its like DID YOU MEAN TEA ROOM KEY?
it's in seed 2, you have to be in that seed for more than 1 minute continuously to unlock it
does Phantom's Pain end this VOD
this track is such a banger. Too bad we didn't get it again in MKW
Bobby! Stop exploding fireworks, Bombette will never like you!
The Bobby I know did that only once
i still can't believe seed 2 exploded
wtf i looked away for 2s
This really is just the forever rando KEKW
Phantom knew what they were getting themselves into
there are far worse fates in the world
you can do it seed 7
it's not seed 2 so it can
don't need the red gem right
this is hilarious outta context cause like...which bear?
Katamari? Dangan Ronpa? Some hot gay dude in an otome?
no this one had all partners before boots
but maybe you got bombette right before boots
seed 2 is really gonna finish last smilers
that’s not the seed where Ralf had palace key was it
I’ve been laying in bed watching I wasn’t sure
just jump on the block to destroy it 5head phanto274Smile
ugh I gotta clear out my boxes for Eevee day tomorrow
Have there been an mismenuings at all and forced buzzer fights?
They finally broke Lua trying to kill seed 2 and keeep it alive
That would be an evil bit option.  Alwasy force Mario to pick the top choice in a dialogue.
rando's gotten rid of a lot of them sadly
What *I* would like to see... would be a legit speedrun with some of these options to see how well you could adapt
THEY DO EXIST IN SEED 8
dammit, my gate is like... as far away as possible
Didn't a different seed have required Master 3?
that's how TMZ spent $300 just stopped the shuffler from ending :P
WHY 3 SEED IN BOWSER FIGHT LOL
i though it was seed 2 twice
60% chance to get bowser, 40% for master
seed 2 isn't real it can't hurt me
look i've been on the watch for bowser for 9h now you can't blame me
So can't pick some seed to hate on
claw was the only thing I didn't want
if you let the non-seed 2 bowser fights win TMZ you will no longer be confused by which seed shows up
oh yea this is the seed that couldn't jump for the longest time
back to your regular scheduled seed 6
hell yeah, glad to see you are still online.
well, i'm happy to see you online my dude, i enjoy watching your stuff :)
the fact you can remember all the seeds and where it leads is pretty damn amazing
the kitten is watching stream with me and keeps trying to swat at the characters. 🤣
I love how healing you on final is somewhat of a detriment lol
nickels refill FP i'm throwing dimes at you
My slow typing is killing me for these fast cuts lmao
💀 I thought they were coming from my end
is it just a randomizer u can cheer bits to mess with? no flame but youve been on this seed 57 hours ?
and I was like 'WHY. IT IS 1 IN THE MORNING. CEASE'
now I’m watching on the tv with delay so I’m omega screwed
so by 10 seeds elaborate. like its 10 games u have to beat or ?
and so you've completed 5 of 10 seeds
TMZ’s phone has that cheer perma copied
despite chat's best efforts /steamed hams voice
I think I'd cap out at like maybe 3, 10 is several too many
only was during my work hours
Ah wasn’t sure if you were still blocked from cheering
it was prob just my browser being stupid it happens
I have to say I would enjoy seeing this again. (yes I will rewatch them on YouTube) but every couple of months do something like this it would be fun and great interaction with the community
Crowd control is almost always a fun time
it better not get stupid again for seed 2’s sake Madge
could you do it with tp or would that be too complicated?
@Amishman19 nah we're good that was on my old work pc this one is good FeelsOkayMan
I gotcha. just was curious so you’re not doing paper mario all the time.
that's two seeds now in finish purgatory lmao
50% chance next seed insta GGs
Quick someone send in a buncha subs-
yeah the last power of 2 haha Aware
so would you reenable the gift 100 redeem aha no reason just asking for a friend
i though it was fully manual
where do you go to let it automatically roll for you
What would happen now then, would it just copy the existing ones again?
now would be a good time to predict if seed 2 finish last or not lol
I still think 2 finishes last
oh damn, which 2 seeds finished since last?
i hope this gets into go mode fast enough i don't have to kill seed 2 again
panel hints would have been massive in this tbh
Not super boots being in a panel close to here you usually find them
anyways imma get ready to sleep since i have to get up by 6am for the flight
so seeds 7 and 10 are the most recent finishes
oh look, palace key is missing
surely we haven’t seen this before
also more than a thousand swaps
funny I guessed 55 hours earlier
I don’t think it’ll hit 60, maybe
hopefully it won’t be a literal repeat of seed 4, scouring the whole damn map
seed 6 is likely to catch up tbh
Cheer50 of course i have to do this
Wait you getting super boots just now means… Dark Koopas again phanto274ColonD
I got excited for a moment Sadge
ahh yes, the sounds of hell phanto274Jam
phanto274Jam thank you for the banger Jaye
so eat your beans and toot your horn apparently
yo phantom i've been here for literally 5 hours doing stuff lmao
aiming shit sounds so cursed with this
what are you talking about? this is the music of the gods
the best is Squirt it sounds actually demonic
this sounds like the average Farewell Experience
Phantom, can I have mod real quick? no reason :)
hasn't it been like 4 hours???
chat if I get banned remember me
and not for the tiddles mcgriddles
although that's just a tiny added bonus
wanna see a cursed lopunny emote?
If I want tiddles, I have a fiance LMAO
Oh hey, thanks for the sub, lol
I've been loving this. Thanks for taking all this pain
that is a very cursed lopunny emote. wish I could unsee that huds601Stare
no I think the other one’s worse
wait I’m getting Deja vu TMZ, did you do this to Phantom before or did you also do this to Justin?
i LITERALLY got affiliate JUST to have this emote globally lmao
okay lmao I wanted to make sure I wasn’t going crazy
tbf the lopunny emote is hype
at this point i just consider myself immune to being weirdchamped
@grover53 Thank you for the sub phanto274Heart
I mostly lurk here but I like PM <3
when will twitch add new scam train emote megara11Wobble
oh my god I finally have the GriddyGoose emote
Me rn: It's after the 4th so it's time for a Sapporo
also I'm launching a million fireworks at whoever made that lopunny emote
Nope just saw Phantom in the sewers
okay so what does that coin bag too?
Welcome to my club Jaye, there’s refreshments in the vack
I was like, why would that be added, but you have coinsanity on too
oh god is vack some slang I don’t know about phanto274S
oh no, it's not even a word
Listen, I’ve mistyped enough things in my life to be scared now KEKW
oh yeah, we finishing this tonight
The light at the end of the tunnel monadoGalaxy
but i'm committed to the bit
whatever 1035 plus 69 is LOL
it’s the final item *final countdown shittily on kazoo*
i love how its the 2 best seed with the worst seed at the end
I will die laughing if it’s shrink stomp chest
did hammer even do anything for this seed
oh yeah that makes way more sense why you're still on
my ass is leaving for the airport a little after 7am
but i've got precheck and clear so it's gonna be chill
she can cook with my Goomnut 😳
I thought it would stop but that would have been classic
grandpa is gonna have the key doesn't he
time to get the Koopa Loot
every second boss today has been Huff I swear
Hurricane should let you blow all the puffs away on this fight
i'm so proud of seed 6 FeelsStrongMan
so 6 just needs to blitz it through everything, 8  is in palace key purgatory, and 2 is gonna get finished last
koot said thanks for the porn
considering 6 still has Bowser’s Castle and another chapter to clear, probably
so this would have been a no hammer seed
one of the rare case of bombette not doing the job Sadge
the funny thing was I was going to say you might still be on the lookout for partner upgrades still but you probably don’t need any more and then you go and reveal Watt
but what if I wanna go blind
they ran out of good session players
so seed 6 has a chance still
Jimmy with the kazoo was their last option
oh god what was that KEKW
this should be a randomizer option for the entire game Kappa
okay I thought it was PrideLaugh
oh it is TMZ it’s cursed
a blitz seed with this would be peak
Most people who put it on have to turn it off after 15 minutes
oh it affects logic due to brain bleeds lmao
this option is called boss shuffler, yes?
i did an hour of 9 MM 1 controller it can't beat that
@TheMasterZelda listen I try my best oh
Okay TMZ, time to learn Pape rando with random pitch on
windows input processing latency made them desync constantly even with normalized movement NiceSoftlock
it's been a long time since I've done a PM rando. I needa try one again soon
its ok i've already lost my mind i can't lose it again
what’s the issue with this seed?
beating hallway with shield up is like, one of the achievements you SHOULD be able to go for in RA
is it a good idea? absolutely not!
is it better than some RA achievements? yea
Mario cares not what is possible, he prevails regardless
10/10 this has been the best free viewing experience of the year for me
its ok you have tons of repel gel
depend if this seed shuffles back in enough
and seed 2 is still in purgatory limesEvil
Swift would be so happy if she could see seed 6 now
jr Troopa being the little bastard he is
listen I’d rather do canonnless of cannon jumps any day of the week
I love all the healing on final KEKW
one of the few times the peril redeem is better
Nope, everyone wants to “help” KEKW
they just have to cheer more than they thought 🤔
I forget, is hammer required to trigger those duplighosts?
you know what this jr fight needs?
I'm pretty much outta bits 3:
what made all or nothing fail more time, shuffles or bizhawk input drops
and now, a word from our sponsor:
so can’t wait for seeds 11-15
honestly surprised i managed to be here enough to stall seed 2 long enough NiceSoftlock
erm actually seed 6 isn't in final
now would be a fucked up timing for OHKO NiceSoftlock
I’m trying so hard to stay awake to watch you finish but my eyes are like it’s time to sleep. thanks for the stream and safe travels to sgdq.
seed 8 has no life shroom
you’re red now! that’s my attack
woah where are all these swaps coming from
I'm kind of getting sick of the seed 2 hate
what time did Otaku need to be up again for your trip?
What next hating on just random people
@Rgamer0 no need to look too much into it HUHH
if you knew what seed 2 did you wouldn’t be saying that
So next time you stan a seed I will be swapping it
yea! seed 2 did.... and.... see!
well, can we just start hating on random people though? What
seed 2 looked at a picture of my dog and didn’t even call him cute
I'm more of a seed 8 fan
time to lock in for the finale 👁️
seed 2 called me something rude during pride month
seed 2 stole a balloon on free balloon day
Seed 2 didn’t hold the door open for my wife
seed 2 (insert funny joke here that I don't have)
I didn’t realize that was still on KEKW
Cheer75 No bias against seed 2
It’s off? Better gift 5 more subs then
Again I just don't promote seed hate
seed 2 sucks. I hate it alongside the other 9 :)
ah yes even longer final YEP
i love how mario is just standing there watching
let’s go for 189 HP final bowser
I'm Back In The Fucking Building (Final Bowser edition)
Again if we reach seed 2 allow it to finish this time
i'm gonna commit to the bit to the end i've been too far into it :)
first to go mode, last to finish
I'm only just trying to be fair to the seeds that's all
TMZ says fuck your sunk cost fallacy baby
do it 4 times more 👀 then my prediction will be true on swaps
I just don't find it funny to hate on random seeds is all after what happened to me yesterday
TMZ has two devils on his shoulders and both say fuck seed 2
@Amishman19 it's like that scene in The Emperor's New Groove where Yzma insults Gronk's cooking and both his angel and demon team up
I believe the quote is "That's it, she's going down!"
@FatPidgeyBirb lmao you’re so right KEKW
Well can't screw seed 2 after this
ok now we can forgive seed 2
I actually wasn't too far off in my prediction
I guessed 1086, I feel that was p good all things considered (chaos)
so what would happen if we tried to swap now? Would anything fuck up? huds601Smug
it was at 82 before I thought
unless my dysfucksia got the better of me
Nope the counter didn't change for me
no we got LinkFall not a waste
not wasted bits if it supports Phantom PrideUwu
wait seed 2 should never haven been slandered wtf
there's no option to start this seed from the beginning so it's def cursed
Goombario does not get finish line privileges
TMZ to seed 2: perhaps I treated you too harshly
Goombario is on Star rod, clearly
finishing 10 seeds with goombario NiceSoftlock
all the channel lore from this is gonna go wild
god imagine Mario holding Goombario up like Simba at the end
and then throwing him off the edge
@Amishman19 just to PaperYeet into the sky
I got a new bit emote out of the bid wars
Congrats on completing the worst Pape speedrun ever
At least I got the cards but I'm so mad about what happened yesterday
I'm out of Yugioh redeems :(
thank you for putting on this show
Henlo YT thanks for watching the shitshow
Do it in the practice room jcogSmile
had fun causing a bit of chaos
you should be able to smash that subscribe, like, and notifcation bells!
Thanks for the stream and enjoy your week off
Next time we'll get to 72 hours
you're gonna have so many tales to tell at gdq
My Sky Striker Extra deck is now finished
Need to get the staples for that deck but it will be done
And one raigeki and 2 lightning storms and called by
ending something like this with full credit just hits different
Hope u have a great time there.
I can only make out like every other word over this music 😅 something about a cup
I'm still Madge my snes controller doesn't work
I have a 2 liter metal one like that.  I use it for rugby games.
its says usb malfunction when i plug it in and i try everything to fix it
I just bring cups and share tea during winter rugby games haha
Honey will help especially if you are speaking for long periods like streaming
Ah yup.  The usual con crud since people can't just stay home...
I dont know why you keep returning to this series phanto274S
also welcomeback, hope you feel better
I know cosplayers who incorporate masks into their costumes because they got so tired of always getting sick
remember optimal movement is rubbing your face against the wall
Cheer100 Choo Choo.  Scam train inbound
i just got home from a long day of doing grandma things and i got the new donkey king
i had to get it physical so i just got home from best buy
I'm LOVING the new donkey kong
Movement is nice except I wish you kept rolling down hills if you press roll
So many encounters.  What is this 4?
I'm still surprised she somehow sets her oven on fire twice.
I asked my viewers and a few said theyl stick arouind to watch it, as unlike echoes of wisdom, not everyone has access to a switch 2, so i have at least that going for me
yeah but you got a whole different type of audience to be fair
The issue with newer games as well is so much competition of viewers too
yeah its just the same few people, so if they wanna watch ill p[lay it lmao
Rock on peaches.  Did you get the amibo too?
I did not, but i can get it if i wanted to, depends on what it gives
Oh every streamer is different.  Hell if you are big enough some people will watch anything.
@peachedpocky from what I can see it's not worth it?  Nothing unique and scanning one gets you terrain to throw
ah yeah then not worth it, im not a collector by any means, all my zelda amiibo are a bunch of coins so like , yeah LMAO
but yeah i just asked the few people that normally show up if they wanna see it, as their opinion is what matters. Im gonna play it regardless LMAO
anyways, good luck with your run, ima be lurking!!
...so many jokes I could make since mayl was between you and the board while jacking in
do u skip the polar bears in single segment or are you forced to fight them due to the rules
But did you have 50 of them? HypeFire
So How was ur time there? What was ur fave meet up and worst moment?
doing experimental AP later tonight. Guys are running games they arent comfortable with the main group so I threw MM Recomp in there. We shall see how that goes.
Oh did you see the hilarity at the Coldplay concert last night?
So I discovered thanks to SGDQ that I am in fact Archipelago capable. I have the Sonic Adventure 2 Randomizer
They did a "kisscam" segment and a ceo was there with his HR rep.
Phantom, how versed are yyou in Majora?
So mirby is who got you sick /joking
Funny that, I ain't doing so hot either atm. Think it's just a cold but a fever I had last night just cracked
i got the OBS scenes ready for my GBC completion project. got a hi-res photo of the transparent purple GBC and made the shell somewhat transparent too
i keep finding awesome mods for MM Recomp LUL
throwing this on to lurk and play DK
wait, cold punch is machine punch, its time stop so pretty bad in this
you should know better than to listen to me when it comes to BN speedruns LUL
i wonder if risch still ahhs the fortnite overlay from like 2 years ago lol
I love this game, one of Capcom's finest game designs and OSTs
How often are the random encounters in the run?
Oh, so there isn't any RNG manip to get less encounters I guess Sadge
it was good. been doing RA for Shadow 05 lol
got like 14 achievements so far and finished neutral and pure dark playthroughs
lowkey i want to learn the run
yeah, i'll probably look around and see what interests me
hmm i didn't hear that lol
it's been on fire for months
I mean your house is on fire in this game
Phantom youre gonna hate setting up your next archipealgo, we on version 0.6.2 now. I had to update 3 games, universal tracker and pop tracker lmao
it took me 35 minutes to get everything up to date on my side
universal got a huge update tho, hinted locations are blue text and out of logic [if your game supports it] will have yellow text
if it says shinobi dash that is a sneakrun
just play in English then you wouldn't need to! :P
translate the one item not in this game LUL
darkness asking for a timeout KEKW
the EU version was published by Ubisoft!?
but i have company over and dont wanna leave this room
An EW copy more like :P
I did get all of them butter15Relieved
Had a juicy run but I did not keep it together tragically butter15Dead
I was so nervous for mine, especially cause all masks is pretty hard. Idk how punishing this run is 🤔
whys that npc got a pacman mouth
let me get arma in here for that
idk how good they actually are at japanese, but it is something arma has studied
I do need to skedadle though. Skittle and I are gonna walk to the indian grocery store butter15Fresh
enjoy the rest of the stream tho <3
definitely! best part of gdq imo
Oh Nintendo is doing the NSO playtest again
people that got accepted for the last one can participate in this one so I guess I'm playing that again
This is not anal this is fisting
When I see these many people streaming dk I know what happens next
Game will be forgotten in a month KEKW
work shift ended at 2nd runs nice sub 2
Good Afternoon and good luck! phanto274Jam
up to u take ur time
God i truly love this game series to bits. if always the 4 number wasnt so cancer to rockman
like why do all dev teams lose their magic on the trilogy.
either way at least you PB'd fire man :D
Oh yeah, I was debating submitting stuff for PAX West
I should be able to make it, it's literally just a bus ride away
Oh nah, I just never ended up moving to LA
My salary wasn't high enough to afford those apartments LUL
You think you're going to PAX even if you don't get accepted?
Haha, I don't remember him telling me LUL
Totally fair, I'll try submitting like, 2 and 6 or something like that
I can literally never forget 6 tbh LUL
I totally expected the Rattys to be faster
I couldn't remember if ColdPnch is in the route
It's technically a BMD in Waterworks
You have to like, turn off a faucet to get to it
Man, watching this makes me want to try this category again
Plus the 2 "random" chips, huh?
I think I just never learned to dodge them, yeah LUL
What route is yours based on?
I don't see RemoBit included, at least
Fair, that's probably the best way to do it
You don't count RIngZap1 as a guaranteed chip, do you? It's technically a BMD that's suuuuper out of the way
I guess technically you could leave a bomb and force him to the front LUL
If you really wanted to ElecSword him
Oh yeah, did you know that entering the metro is technically a cutscene you can skip everytime? At least on the Japanese version
Only learned about it because of the manip route LUL
That's probably like, 1-2s per metro trip, yeah
well skipping all the metro "cutscenes" will save like 30 seconds right there :P
Oh yea we rockin the praccy once again
Minish Cap Rando after finishing hotfix and are free
im waiting on food then Im starting an async with MM and Banjo
I really need to document a video on the BN2 SS manip, maybe I should look at the BN1 one as well
Im doing Zaxbys. So chicken tenders, fries, and a slice of toast.
Either one works, I used DeepL to figure out his BN2 spreadsheet
Ive been keeping an eye out for the next risch stream so I can see if !fortnite still works LMAO
It's funny seeing the way certain words get translated
Well, now that you say something, I can just go disable it rischSmile
can you frame perfect skip that encounter?
I wonder what happens if you try Life Virus skipping it
I assume someone has considered it
The same technique used for Polar Bear skip, and Style Change skip in BN2
I know NT has a life virus...
Ahh, my bad, forgot the DLC boss isn't well known
The rest of the comps are just like, look at maps
Also that, or struggle profusely with another terrifying boss LUL
When exe1 OSS was revealed honestly I was thinking it would be a new opening scenario to set the stage, then have you do one scenario from each game like power plant, netopia castle, ect, then the end game scenario.
Yeah, you cannot do the same skip strat for that fight in Oven Comp. It's basically a cutscene trigger, so no known way to skip it
for GBi i use switch snes controller, I have a gcn blutooth dongle
i was using the snes mini controller but my A button has gotten loose
also the dongle has complete button remapping
so I can play bn with start mapped to L making it easier to skip cutscenes
Majora was awful yesterday. My first dungeon was great bay and I stumbled thru it as others werre finishing their games phanto274S
Recomp is awesome tho! love having more games not require bizhawk
@Risch Yo! Hows ur summer goin so far?
Yo stavros, it's going well. Spent the last 2.5 weeks with my girlfriend, and have a family beach trip coming up in August
Man, that 1s, just gone LUL
@Risch Kinda feeling homesick no lie but my 1st bday without my dad wasnt too bad last month and was a great time. I am absolutely loving DK Bananza
I wish TrnArrow was this easy in BN6 Sadge
You can still technically sub 1:40 :)
I think any time you enter the metro and need to take it, try holding start as you area transition basically
Yep, that would be the way to do it
This split wildly varies because of all the encounters you can technically skip too
With step counter resets and all
It was clearly because of Tri Arrow
No worries, I can always translate anything else I need
Yep, that's basically the same as the BN2 one LUL
A page for each possible frame
I reached the end of Donkey Kong Bananza and I feel enlightened
Oh, that's basically just tutorial draws I think
The window the manip targets for the tutorial is just every other frame
So it's like a 50-50 to get it
Oh I just got auto-invited to the new NSO playtest
Well, there are 2 frames in there that draw 3 cannons, and the rest of the odd frames draw 2 cannons
i must be tired. the text looks like jibberish
The even frames you can technically do in 2 turns, you get a minibomb and then take like, 3 other chips, and draw 2 cannons on turn 2
I wonder if it'll run at 60fps on Switch 2
At least, I assume that might be the case. The spreadsheet doesn't list the turn 2 draws, I only know from the 1 frame I hit LUL
im gonna attack you with… addition! hahaha
i can put numbers on balls too… lol
theres a small addition to god needed
heading out will be lurkin from time to time
Also, upon further testing, the "draw 2 cannons on turn 2" strat is not guaranteed sadly LUL
I also don't see any documentation on how fights with 2 cannons are supposed to align with 3 cannon fights for the Internet 1 manip
Cause the 40 extra buster shots increases RNG a ton
If you wanted to go insane, you could analyze the buster particles in the 2nd fight to know exactly which RNG value you're on and force the 3 cannon draw everytime :)
Idk, I was just messing around with this to understand
Also, looking at this movement, the trees in ACDC are annoying, I got stuck on them multiple times LUL
The only problem I have with this manip is there are basically only 2 good frames in the tutorial, making this incredibly difficult. Idk if I'd want to reset that heavily
The elec manip was actually way better, I don't remember the exact amount
It was when I tried manipping aqua, that was a single frame
But at least there I had the most amazing audio cue that I somehow never missed
Yeah, nowadays I'd always go for elec
This was prior to me manipping 50% of the game
Any% can save and reset to fix it, but can't reset in SS, so you have to jack in
I do need to reclaim a better leaderboard spot
I'm looking at this internet 1 manip, and man, the memorization on some these movements is gonna be stupid
is this ran on pc or the gba
i know nothing about this game but gl
how many chips do you have right now or is it something you check later?
do you speedrun other games or just mmbn?
stupid ads just came the second you answered
piplikeWave yo phantom gl speedrun prep
whats the difference between a gdq and a gdq hotfix?
btw about the shuffler AP thing, i got too into routing a pokemon romhack so i haven't had time yet
but i do still plan to do it just after im done with this project
well yea its in the name Kappa RNG Chips
i actually didnt know that lol im probably just dumb xD
but lets go isnt as RNG i would think
i would say its just more adaptive rng
isnt gutsman available as a fight or is that a later game?
Yeah, works almost identically in BN2
Except there's no armor to boost your level
Well, it's how sneakrun rates are determined
Yeah, just having the armor is the important part LUL
Also, idk if I'm just stupid
Until you have to talk to the prog
And then I don't get what Jugoomba does to keep it consistent
Well, most of the text sequences you just hold B for
Yeah, it also kinda sucks you have to mash fast through Glyde LUL
I kept going late because my mashing is slow
I'm also really bad at the Tutorial Fight 2 because I can't always get the buster shots in
Yeah, it's just those 29 that are a struggle
Honestly it's not even a problem if you do one extra, unless you were on the last frame
It's just one extra RNG advance
So, the frames he highlighted are 1321-1332
So it's like, an 11 frame window, but every other frame
So you have .1833333s to hit the "window"
It's not awful, except for the fact you can't reasonably know if you're on an even or odd frame LUL
Me neither, that would probably explain it
I think devil had WR until Jugoomba went back to BN5 earlier this year
is there a place you can learn the run if i say wanted to get into it?
All the even frames look identical
But yeah, slightly late when you draw MiniBomb L and Cannon A
And just a single Cannon is also late
Drako was saying earlier that it's a "based fucking run"
BN1 is such a good game
how come that one wasnt a rng chip the shockwave earlier?
Shockwave is technically a chip you can get guaranteed
Getting it randomly from a fight just saves the time of grabbing the BMD later
ah ok thank you for answering
Uhh, you can get 50-50d in BN2 as well
i don't think i've seen it when i was playing it
The SS manip relies on it to get some good 200z drops early on
I do think later games have generally nicer drop tables
But also collect makes you forget about it
Literally BN1 has a 100% drop rate for TriArrow at S rank
Why tf couldn't they just keep that energy
Yeah, 50-50 for A or B code
maybe its better to not mention it lol
Most chips are at least a 50-50 at 6 rank, so it was a fair attempt
Yeah, it was a 1/6 LUL
That is one of the beauties about this category though
i remember as a kid...getting stuck on number man for a long time lol
Lots of on the fly decision making
cause i couldnt figure out the damn umbrella
or wait am i thinking the wrong game lol
9 is the number of seats in 5A
One of them is like, the number of books in the library
i did not know that haha
it's still engraved in my mind when i accidentally traded in a prism chip during my Hotfix run of BN 2 ssonicLUL
i had one luckily, but had a chance to have at least 2
i didn't realize it saves automatically
that should be fine for marathon runs i think
although the category would change, right?
i do want to come back to BN 2 at some point
NT is on my radar for a future run to learn
was lurking cuz I was dead for most the day due to being ill
stg, I ate my mum's cooking then started feeling worse throughout the days. Cannot tell if that's why I got sick
cuz I'm masked up at work
less food poisioning more I hear her hacking up a lung on occasion
joke's on her, my life insurance's set to go straight to my older brother
I love the ElecSword strat LUL
4 checks, 3.125%, 6.25%, 9.375%, and 12%
I think its a 72% chance to avoid the encounter, so 28% overall chance at getting it
I love RedWave more, but still
RedWave is nuts, it gets used a lot in the manip run
80 across all rows ain't bad
RedWave is only 100 total, so pretty comparable
Damn, traffic comps giving out some stuff today
Also, I think I figured out the Internet 1 manip thing
I think just like BN2 with the GMD, you need to check your shadow location when talking to the prog to see how far away you are from the expected spot
And adjust your movement a bit based on that
Which is annoying, but I'm not surprised Jugoomba does it
I was going to go check if DynaWave is one of the 50-50 options
I almost would never risk going for RingZap3
And gold the final split by saving 4s with metro cutscenes :)
Just get FireManV3 on the way :)
Clearly, you golded because you skipped those metro cutscenes
Ignore the fact that you didn't take the metro 12 times for that to make sense
hello hello, good luck on your run
I mean, 2 extra turns probably loses 20-24s
that's what i've been doing this whole time
Tbf, that fight was relatively fast
You might have also just gotten fewer than typical encounters, maybe by 1 or 2
FireMan is just a 2 turn virus fight LUL
Did you get Dash prior to Chip Trader?
You definitely didn't count it during that
cool i was going to lurk there
Probably won't be able to stick around long but had to get those out while I got the chance
just gold everything and you'll prolly sub 1:30! :D
how insane was that fireman gold split?
the tas of this must be crazy
looks like the game wants you to suffer today
Zenny can be exchanged for chips and services phanto274Smile
This game and RNG being weird Sadge
I think your fan is scouting your room
gotta love the golds that don't matter cuz you'll never get them again
So I'm working on backing up a bunch of discs. And this one has an extra scene file that I don't see where in the DVD it's used so I don't know what episode its for LUL
was fun, been playing FF3 pixel remaster
same! i like the original FF3 and the DS version lol
but the pixel remaster is far and away better
the pixel remaster OST is giving me the feels
that doesn't surprise me too much
i actually have yet to play any of these. i off and on consider getting the collection (or remasters? w/e) when its on sale
will u start commentary practice tomorow or next week?
Phantom, I've only ever seen you do Zelda before. Today is an odd day
oh yeah i would be getting it just to play
yeah you also do like paper mario n stuff right
... okay, but I'm a dumb dumb and mostly only watch Zelda streams...
@PippyInATopHat you say as i was playing FF
Well, as established, your stream was my second choice after gym's TP run... which ended... the problem was handled by that XD
@PippyInATopHat "you're my second choice", i'm honored
Hey, my greatest accomplishment is being HeidiPHD's 2nd favorite speedrunner
And one of Linkus's "three favorite people"
I thought u and phantom were friends for like half a decade and helped u on ur partner push?
i went to GDQ once and its been a spiral of knowing more and more people since
(to be clear, Linkus called me one of his "three favorite people" while drunk one night. I barely know the dude but this was the funniest thing imo)
SHadow ur here to! Lots of familiar names today.
@stavros12c34anenoglou It's been awhile! Heya hello!
I became a GDQ host and suddenly everyone is my coworker :3
i mean i may not be a coworker next event
i'm really thinking of taking one off and just attending
well i'll probably table, but otherwise, the attendee life
Oh, I thought that you'd be my boss Punkin
@PippyInATopHat we both know you'd never listen to me
And the Goddess Sword from this past SGDQ
You assume I listen to the host leads and don't just go rogue on mic :>
@PippyInATopHat i'm assuming nothing, I *know* you dont listen to me lol
...I don't go rogue on mic... I fear authority...
That was a very interesting sword to make marphNODDERS Also my first one. Definitely learned a lot between the Prize sword and the one I made for Glubbers
games making sure theres a little humility
Skyward Sword runner brain = engaged
Am I allowed to swear here?
Sorry, I'm from New Jersey, I need to swear for emphasis
pippy, actively hearing the streamer swear, "am i allowed to swear here"
oh yeah does this board sort by RTA or IGT?
person who only runs SA2: "hm. imagine having inaccurate IGT"
would be hard to use IGT anyway since it doesn't display in seconds
only if you tell me how to do Minish Cap rando in aggressive detail
the IGT in SA2 is absurdly accurate iirc
Hope the BN1 speedrun reviewers don't hear that you're a filthy cheater :P
oh btw what program do you use for displaying your button inputs? As someone that's gonna have to stream some racing very soon I would like to display inputs as well :D
My audio tech during my stream tech shift at GDQ was making fun of me for answering questions on the comms system that were definitely intended for the stage manager but were just... about how the wii works
i just use the SNES style 8Bit Do for everything atm
They were asking about like the aspect ratio outputs and I was like "dude, I've never played this game, but I have the release year and I know the Wii, fire away"
Oh I was suggesting naming it UwU
oh right yeah I don't play Mario Kart much lmao I thought Waluigi had his own pinball game that I'd never heard of lmao
I guess I'm Link now XD
pippy is link.. congrats on the transition king...
I feel like the DLC for HW is already almost rando
Most of my memories of that game are "PLEASE GIVE ME THE ITEM I NEED MISSION. I DON'T WANT TO PLAY AS AGATHA ANYMORE."
gearing up for the next run
glgl rando for fun (not switching) (clickbait) (fake)
what kind of psycho wants to race with traps on???
I like a good solid trap once in a while in my rando
idk if I'd want it for a race rando tho
standard race naturally, there may be some kinda sickos rando race of pain and despair fatpidSip
I mean the hearts are always on screen so marking them isn't really that necessary
I... zoned out while I was reviewing game submissions... what did I just witness?
this game is held together with tape and glue
much like every other zelda game
@PippyInATopHat Phantom was just pulling the pillar, what's so weird about that?
Not really? Only bits and pieces XD
I was going to play it casually in the next few weeks
I've only ever seen bits and pieces, but with the other stuff done in the speedrun I just kinda blink and go 'yeah'
just draw bombs and they appear
simply buy the bombs from the vendor in castle town (that isn't totally a trap quiver)
@PippyInATopHat big fan of organs actually
Organs are very important for living yeah
@oblobb that's what Big Organ WANTS you to think.
oh yeah I just got a graded 10 rainbow charizard V Max not sure if i told u yesterday
What if I wanna skip gust bellows?
he's a nerd and an artist I am morally obliged to like him
There's always One (1) bomb maze...
it's more false imprisonment than cheating I feel like
how much do fairies sell for? :D
you ate the pasta already I guess
nice spawn camping tektite there lmao
didnt expect this til after the hotfix lol
also i deleted my banjo async last night, forgot about the async and thought it was an old sync seed. Luckily im in end game and just needed to rush bosses
last night was a trip, we did a sync seed and 5 of us did a banjo mumbo token item link. When 1 person finds one we all get one. Only 100 in the pool and goal was 80. It took like 5 hours lmao
we should get the guys together for a paper mario powerr star item link
you just add it to yaml
but yeah, every yaml has item link by default
same area you junk checks and start with hints
i hope minish AP will be good
im sure itll be easier to learn than MM
there is a pop tracker for auto tracking as well. I know there were some checks that wouldnt send I havent been keeping up with it tho
ive been swayed to more over to pop tracker, the auto tracking is just so valuable when your in a live group of 20 and checks are coming from everywhere
3 weeks ago minsih cap went beta. Looks like its time to try it now
i was basically just waiting on alpha to finish
Still in development! Fusions are locked to "Open" right now and there's no setting for dhc access, only either a Vaati/Pedestal finish
so all key items are required like how pape handles it?
there is a default yaml and expert yaml
No way chickens like that also work in real life
okay so you set number of elements. If Vaati is goal you need this many before DHC opens, otherwise collect elements and enter sanctuary
Phantom, my mum's made nachos again. I think she's plotting another attempt on my life.
@DreamcatcherSky the last time I ate said cooking, I got notably sick
I've got an odd cramp claw going on with my left hand
I'm not bothered by it, cramps are, by and large, fun for me
Basically the only section of muscle I can't tolerate cramping is along the back of my calfs. I can and have, out of boredom, induced cramps in other major muscle groups since I was wee.
@DreamcatcherSky "induced cramps in other major muscle groups since I was wee" HUH
The muscles get so very tightly constricted, like steel cords
I understood the "wee" part, the part about inflicting cramps upon oneself is what got me
NODDERS I'd go that way first
@buff00n Oh, yeah. I've been doing it for so long that most of the involved muscle groups have become resistant to manual induction of cramping unless they've been involved in extended strenous activity, such as running around at work for six+ hours.
So it's become more of a relaxation technique for sore muscles.
you can run minish cap AP from mGBA
i love not supporting bizhawk LUL
glad its only a HP, that means I can skip it no problem
@Axl_SR What, or who, is Bizhawk
Final thoughts on DK banaza now that 2 of my streaming pals just finished it 15/10 A master class mix of Metroid, Zelda, and Odyssey.
ive played bananza for less than an hour still lol
does it have SMO post game structure?
not really, just a yes or no
Real ones will say it's DK64 if it was good
What do you get when you cross a rabbit with a water hose? Hare spray.
also base yaml with no changes had 330 checks
if you add rupeesnaity, shuffle pots, shuffle digging, and shuffler underwater its 487
also underwater rupees are in the underwater grouping
what is this blasphemous "rando for fun"? WutFace
lol i know you've been back from gdq but wb
i peeked at minish AP, turns out it went beta 3 weeks ago
RE7 AP is playable which is CRAZY
Re2 Remake is pretty solid in AP
but tbf, RE2 Remake is a perfect game soooo
minish AP had a rough start, then once they got permission from LeonarchCG and Myth it started to pick up steam.
i need to pick on re7 on pc now i guess
yeah there's a lot, the typewriter warp helps a lot with RE2/3/7
yup! it keeps it from being too linear
you unlock it once you interact with it
just added re7 to my wish list gonna get it when it go on sale
oh for sure, it's a great idea, and they're all RE Engine so they can all utilize it
its always go on sale for super cheap
i forget non-RE games are on RE engine too lol. not a lot, but a few
monster hunter wilds is on re engine
devil may cry i think is too
street fighter 6 is on re engine too
i find it interesting that Fzero GX and super monkey ball used the dame engine, then you also have wario land 4 and metroid fusion too
i dont know if it was the same team but it was the same engine
i wonder what else the Deer Force did besides SM, i never saw their name
Oh both games were made by amusement vision so yeah
Deer Force was real kinda like Rare but got disbanded real quick
@RvPA coorperate the worst masterminds of em all. Will never forgive nintendo for stealing goemon 3 for oot zelda not getting banjo threeie not getting conker 2 and diddy Kong Racing 2.
sure id love to see a 3rd banjo game but I seen in interviews that a 3rd banjo game was never planed. As for that banjo footage on gamecube? just a tech demo
@Axl_SR which was later used on and FOR Mario Odyssey
even if rare stayed with banjo we may have not gotten anymore banjo games. However we def wouldve gotten Conker's Other Bad Fur Day.
it was microsoft or activition, which funny enough now they own activition
Booties my fave weapon in this game!
calling boots a weapon is a stretch
you get it at the shoemaker
wherre else would you get shoes phanto274Smile
today i started watching a speedrun documentary called running with speed. Have you seen it? Mitch got a huge spotlight in it.
my parents stream plutoTV and I saw it was free on there with ads
the doc i watched was he most recent gdq panel of the speedrunners mental and health
its a free app on my TV
Oh that's a cool Bomberman shirt
calls PB not good that bops Risch, are you calling risch not good at exe1? LUL
On my way to the dentist for the bi-annual tooth cleaning
I can actually be here because I’m not working lol
No reset?  But I thought we were going for max resets possible vampir7Itsfine
ive gotten into my weird mood of loving farming sims again so I got into this weird love/hate relationships with how bad some of the fishing minigames are
I literally hated it so much i downloaded a mod for stardew to skip that fricking minigame.  I didnt have time for that.
its a quicktime clicking minigame where you need to keep it within the bar and you dont know what fish is on the line until it starts moving.
and if it ever leaves the bar you are "punished" by missing the perfect catch bonus.
i've learned up almost through cits
yeah pillar is still really inconsistent
i'm def having more success with the setupless, yeah
i'll check those out at some point for sure
AD seems to be a favorite for a lot of folks in the community from what i've seen/heard
glad i'm learning a route that does pillar clip then I guess haha
eventually want to run AD too I think
does AD do gorge void stuff?
gotcha, I'm also just glad you don't have to epona slide over the damn pit there
because that for me has been the hardest
yeah, i'd heard morpheel is really bad
honestly between that and the epona slide i might just say fuck it and learn the more optimal route lol
i'll have to look a bit more but yeah, probably
it might be a thing where I keep the pillar clip route since it carries over to AD
i forgot how funny some of the minibosses are in this game
like, I forgot death sword existed

Wow, 20 months. That's almost old enough months to drink in the USA!

idk what it is with my kz but it takes me like 20+ seconds to export a save
it was funny for the first like 5 save states
yeah it's never taken that long
i tried a different sd card and it was the same thing
my childhood wii is just on the verge of exploding i guess
oh wow you land right here
the movement into the boss room looks sketch with the boots
i bought a bunch of new pc parts
like the any% method looks free in comparison
things gonna have a 12 core cpu and 64gb of ram
it's if you go too far back iirc
did you hear ozzy osbourne passed away today Sadge
So i'm over covid, but now I have an ear infection and a bacterial sinus infection lol
AINTNOWAY so avp sent u scathing message
Will u commentate this time or no?
not a fan of risch on coms?
one of the more knowledgable peeople
Oh its not that just saying if speech and knowledge need tuneups as well
yyou know it well enough to bop risch lol
Hotfix, it's Risch and I on comms
Look, morph is a BN enjoyer
is your run on the board yet?
Oh, right, I can maybe go and review it
Maybe not for BN1 tho, I forget LUL
An hour ago and it's not accepted???
risch should flag it so he doesnt get bopped LUL
its so someone is always available
Make me a mod too, I love not doing work
Also, looks like I am a BN1 mod, so I'll get around to that after work
Phantom send me these notes again
Dalus, Drako, fatkid, Terraj, Prism, myself, Kilios, lucky, existence, smog, and yukki
Prism is on that list!? THE PRISM!?!
I havent seen prism in like 11 years
He was at the teambn meetup a few years ago
That was my first interaction with them
yeah, i remember watching prism runs back in the day
welcome in raiders to raf run
Kinda debating between running BN2 or fully relearning this category LUL
WTF did you draw in your PB?
Well, his fireman time is also probably nuts by nature of manip
I didn’t answer yet because my phone needed plugged in but I’m doing okay. got a headache on one side of my head so I’m just laying down for a bit since I ate to see if that helps
make sure you PB so we can run back minish cap rando again LUL
That's the third time in the last few days
You could have technically bought a second one, twice as likely to draw :3
Honestly it is probably better to save for an extra chip, yeah
What's your estimate? 1:50 or 2:00?
Yeah, this run is kinda bad that way
I was about to say, that's probably the better way to go
Force at least a few so you're not doing some miserable strats
Well, at least BN2 has a backup for ZapRing2 B you can save before too in a worst case
At least they aren't physically required tho
Hmm, I've been thinking about it
I'd probably expand the manip so that even if I go early or late, I can chain into at least 4 dashes
And in a truly worst case, I can have a save that starts right after the GMD so that I can at least show off the rest of the route if I fail something
Yeah, the 1600z is needed for the early HPMem and sneakruns
The pax submissions aren't on the GDQ website, right? I keep looking and not seeing them, is it just through Twitter/blue sky?
Ahh, makes sense. I was wondering what was up LUL
I did find the link on blue sky, but was wondering why I couldn't find it on the website
Also, I went and looked it up. That tutorial frame you hit was 2 frames early
If you pb I'll shove an entire paper roll up my ass
Now have fun with not pb ing
Did you see the Pokemon news?
Mega Lopunny confirmed was the best part for me
I think it's fine, but also uninspired
felt like pokemon said here, damn 🙄
I would stay for longer, but gotta prepare myself for a hour zoom call for an client. So see ya around Phantom
Hello. My footage began rendering. And suddenly I was here.
Dude, I'm rendering my PB footage from last night? Over 20 seconds lost to the final boss just deciding not to become vulnerable
I don't know the LA bosses by name...
Ah, I did not beat LA
But sounds similar. You have to wait for it's eye to open on the top screen then do a stylus input
I also have to depart as we're going out for groceries in a sec here. I hope the rest of the stream is good <3
It's eye operates pretty independently of what the boss is doing so it has like one attack that prevents the eye from opening until it's done attacking
But it didn't even do that last night... he just walked at me menacingly... and didn't open it's eye
brb I need to charge my human (aka get food)
Just did that, the Swiss enchiladas was a mistake
The cheese got stuck in the plate
It's just cheese within the salsa
Oh it's not Swiss cheese, idk where Swiss comes from but it's gouda or cheddar usually
The original recipe is with gouda but with it having a strong flavor they opt for cheddar most times
Vegan wrap from a local place
Nah, just one of the many... okay, not many, but two at least?
I am close to finishing I think but need to go take care of Stuff ™️ so I'll look at it again after
Ye just fenangling with the fine lol
She said she hated the flames
IT'S THE SHADOW, I'M NOT SATISFIED LOL
With some it looked like ocean more than fire KEKW
Also did variety nag you for not running the game?
She does that for kicks sometimes
Even though you PBd like 2 days ago
THIS guy can't battle the network YOU
Nah fuck you too much spam
Told you sticking things up my ass as a promise curses runs
I'm a big fan of the fictional character Spamton G. Spamton
The turkey was close but nope
BN1 trying to not be convoluted challenge
Wait this was in the show right?
The one I don't remember is if zero is covered in the animé
But same tldr? Virus king kinda?
zero was in the beyondard arc so bn6 timeline
Where does that piece of shit take place time wise
Zero being there and then in 6
I just remember oh cool my fav character followed by malding
bass is post game in exe1 as well
Oh, do you know about the FireTowr F trade?
I remember bass in nt I think?
My goat was just vibing until BN3
I remember beating him and that's it
Some kid behind Mayls house gives it
It starts in like, Chapter 3?
Can I yell at you since Variety can't?
Idk if that's post NumberMan, or post StoneMan, or even post IceMan tho LUL
According to trez, Chapter 3 is StoneMan scenario, so
Yeah, I saw you get it and didn't seem as excited as I was, and I was like "does he know about this? Idk what notes includes it or not"
TimeLinks notes mention the trade, but like, near the end LUL
So I'm still not 100% sure when it opens
It might also be after sleeping after NumberMan, tbf
Well, I guess you don't sleep, huh. Not for a while anyway
is that how this game usually goes?
so some of the harder stuff is at the beginning
So there's an auto splitter for emu, since it looks at stuff in memory. I've considered picture based autosplitters, but it's a bit awkward because the time starts when the screen barely starts fading to black, so idk the best way to handle that
And do the math on what the timer offset should be
I might mess with that myself at some point
Oh, I sent you a picture of the draws around the window
I can add a tab to your translated spreadsheet if you want
I think you didn't skip the cutscene fast, cause I thought I saw stuff outside of battle between the fights
But I may have been hallucinating
idk what that's supposed to mean bot
12s for an extra turn sounds about right
Did you know that the number doors are technically not random?
They're just based on the frame counter since power on
It's not using the random function at all
I had a strat that tried to get the doors to be 00 every time LUL
I uh, lined it up by hard resetting prior to starting a run, and keeping an eye on the timer
Normally, Any% just used the standard number doors strat though, it doesn't try to manip them
Uhhhh, I think it's a time stop, and drops a snake on the enemy field
Idk how much damage it does, could be worthwhile?
I'm doing alright. Sinuses are bleh, but eh
what can you do with this weird fucking weahter?
oh good, that's good to hear! PrideUwu
Also I just sent The Goods ™️
i need to get some emotes focused on GBCQ or something
That'd be REALLY fucking funny if I sent edibles considering I have never been in contact with them
I'm g you kids have fun swifOld
I kid though. I don't do them a whole lot PrideLaugh
@OhHeyItJaye I'm glad there are people out there that responsibly enjoy them, I like doing things like walking back the fucked up people from a diff hotel anyways tippiNice
@Swiftalu LOL, that's usually been my job in the past PrideLaugh I don't generally like to get fucked up. It's extremely rare ohheyi30Hehe
Somehow able to spot me even tho I was never a webcam streamer (But I mean hey I look the same as I did when I was 14/15 lmfao)
I just like to help people out
i only met you cause ice was chatting with you lmao
Zeke is so easy to spot, I literally was watching a gdq video on bsky where it's the 2 people holding the sign with the dot, and Zeke was in that video
@Mirby_Studios Ice easy to find 👁️ 👄 👁️
it is pretty easy to find someone who is frozen ohheyi30Hehe
but in seriousness, they're easy to spot
and then i kept running into you after lol
Some people could not find me
phantom everyone is small compared to you :P
Swift almost hid me in her pocket
Dang, so someone actually taller than I am
Oh yea that animated fire turned out way better than I hoped
He like, came shortly after me in 2019, left within a year or 2, came back for another year, and then left a year later or something
Yeah, I don't think he was enjoying Amazon, then came back after being hired by Twitch, and still realized that wasn't for him
Second job out of college, and is still there, kinda miserable
OK, fair, mine has been there maybe 4 or 5 now
I keep seeing all my old coworkers on LinkedIn, there's maybe 1 or 2 still there
getting my MC yaml readdy for tonight, just need to run thru palace of winds before starrting
Don't ever pin me down btw hope this helps -> megaFlushed
so is this the month of battle network
make it a race, they love races
imagine if you raced fatkid on the stage lol
look man, i'm satisfied with how my tourney run went
i got dalus to do comms on my pb
go follow paperaces for daily pape content
so what im thinking is vaati:false, elements:4, swords:5, and dungeons:4
you can set elements to anywhere, meaning you can do less dungeons
I'm happy that a option but no i want them in dungeons
it lets you shuffle elements but still give value to clearing dungeons
I love the floating e background
i take it in your rando cloud and swamp kinstones are anywhere?
damn not the right one this time
you ever think about why a stove needs multiple network areas?
im trying to steal my neighbor's recipes if we had that irl tbh
thinking of other in-house dungeons, yai's makes sense because its the ac for the whole mansion
I was going to suggest that the only thing you can really do is stand near the front and pray he tries to punch you
But you were standing in the front and he was a jerk both times, so
Love praying for the 3/8 chance that an enemy comes to the front
oh you know, dozing off in my chair while "working"
Nice, I'm just taking a little lunch break since I finally got one nightmare ticket done with
if you try sometimes, you might just find you get what you need
me? come to a BN stream? I wouldnt be caught dead
too late axl, we have photos
I was gonna say, Lock On is a cool chip
will htere be a humor incentive?
I did see Gaia, yeah LUL
Honestly dont even know what Gaia does in this game
its up to risch to find a list of the jokes and tell em
Tbf, that humor incentive is pretty good. Just force commentary to read from a list of the humor jokes randomly per donation LUL
I did that for MAGFest a while back
It might have been, I can't remember
I just know that Terraj wasn't there that year and I had to do it all myself Sadge
Did something about the run change your mind? LUL
Oh yeah, I remember you mentioning that the other day
simply be bad enough to not use them
I think he just... moved on the right moment to dodge the ''impact'' of Gaia
It did , the screen kept shaking
I may need to expand the frames you can see, if you want the English version
Yeah, that was probably 1313 or 1315
there you go stop getting bad rng
Bop Smog and then never care again rischSmile
man that leaderboard is crazy, 5 minutes between 4th and 5th then 6 minutes between 1 and 3 phanto274S
Dex installed DOOM on himself! He's been singing One Beer for the past hour!
RNG only advances in battle when it's called, so it should only be buster shots, particles, and explosions
Or like, enemies that move randomly
Yeah, probably faster to just buster normally LUL
Imagine even the ability to reg a chip
Or you know, just run away without drawing a chip :)
gl on runs + hotfix that’s awesome!
what's a time you're willing to take on Fireman?
If you're confident you're late, you can always do fewer busters, or yeah not overlapping
Yeah, I think that was at least 8 frames late
There's a few different triple minibomb frames that are all late
You claimed the max amount Madge
It could be early or late, I think
What tf is this time variance hypnoWhat
So we've got rng served with the rng
finally making into an actual stream and not just the vod on youtube
happens to the best runners man, sorry you had that happen.
once you enter dark hyrule castle can you not leave?
we need to plan another sync ap been awhile
im gonna run MM for that
im trying to priortize new games
yeah, i run TP when I just want to turn my brain off
i would do a link to the past but snes controller Deadge
KEKW I think this was the 1st time in history i had the same streamer thrice on tabs
Welcome in raiders to battle network.
Doin fine just got done with ot and and having late snack now
well, im currently trying to max out everything in dragon quest treasures for switch. have 16 million left until rank 15 base
oh yeah that remind me dragon quest builders 2 is on sale
the prequel to dragon quest XI, the one about treasure hunting and dragon’s and fighting other monster gang’s
Like you don't use the password 1234 YOU
yeah it's not a very secure system...
"based on how long the world has existed"
that woulda been nice slightly earlier
If you pb I'll shove a crab up my ass
Luck is for losers, you have luck
damn there are 16 different yugioh sounds!?
Meanwhile the worlds one had only subs
oh yeah the new emotes phanto274Fine
It was Tuesday so as soon as swift finished them
ooh, too bad my memory is too bad to tell which ones are the new ones.
How about you draw this fuck instead swiftp11Nom
They sniff and hunt that phantom aura
i am here to make one message
youre welcome my engagements is off the charts
@stavros12c34anenoglou  glennj5WAVE  Stravos i am dying rn
@Glennjaamin Just got done with my own OT
heat exhaustion symptoms are brutal i am 4 bottles of water deep rn
ive been out in 3 weeks of heat wave and today it was probably only like 95 on turf Disappointed
i saw you got into RaF
I think that's what it is, anyway
I remember looking at it because I was like "but what if we use 2 steals on NumberMan and sword him in Any%"
i am the true phantom fan
LuL real ones show up without notice or warning
real ones show up specifically to bug phantom el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
im dead serious i have done NOTHING this summer but work
I still haven't heard back from GDQ about not receiving password reset emails
thats what i thought you thought Analyze
Debating if I should just dm someone on discord LUL
I know, it's some time this weekend
Lemme just message Richard and see what happens
DK Bananza is nuts the pros already getting 130
BN1 has some amazing encounter rates
Why can't they all be like Power Plant comp, which is the standard dungeon comp rate in later games I feel
Chip is so good on bosses
hopefully I’ll be able to make it. I work tomorrow
While we wait we just watch people die
late chore doing brings an extra lvl of tiring
Did you count RingZap as a random chip? Or did the number go up because of Mine2 later?
The real problem with doing resets of this category
It is still stellar to me Also my mixed veggie cooking is done.
is BN1 the most straightforward BN run ?
a coworker showed me that Hogan died and my immediate first thought was the JJJ "Thanks for the good news!"
that's ridiculous, they obviously should start with 4.5 :P
And the BN2 recommendation comes with the old Single Segment route, that was basically "get PAs and just wait until you draw them"
I love in the anime that if "Ms. Mari" had her hair put into a croissant, that meant Lan was in for a bad time
i mean ti's actually a possibility now!
Late game fights were just "dodge until you get Gater"
real talk the mobile games were actually really fun lmao
Then we started hyper optimizing that category, and now it looks scary
BN4 is also not bad if you do Set Seed, which is just starting from a specific save file that hits tourney manip already
Frame perfect trick with confirmation 20 minutes later :)
better than BN2 where you find out like an hour later :P
You mean like style change manip?
yeah that's what i'm referring to lol
It's also a 5 frame window with a pretty solid audio cue to confirm, at least to me
so, BN6 basically brought that chip back as AirRaid. Cool.
You do have 6 escapes :)
the best strim ever considering circumstances
does 4 years of this game mean this time you're live with pape rando for 4 years
oh so it's been 4 years, not you're planning 4 years
Risky meaning the end part for bowser?
i have 630h18m27s of TP AD specifically, apparently
roughly the same timespan, so i was curious
Might as well do risky you're already that close to just do it
If you pb can I punch mirby?
Fine can I bitch slap glub?
@theglubbers cmere cat girl time to make you meow
honestly i'm surprised both were accounts
Wasn't there a runner that was just jelly?
jelly has an actual picture so probably pichu lol
you stole the grape soda joke before i could say it in chat last night lmao
We love the grape soda jokes in BN
it's just not very good grape soda
it's taht one store brand that nobody likes
I hope the run is going well
I just got my letter from pax saying I didn't make the run up program for indies dev, but im still really excited to go.
But still really cool that I can just apply. I made an AFK game for Twitch streamers.
So this one, the twitch sends commands to control a duck in a race, kind of like of like mario kart.
but that would be really dope to see you in real life.
Do you have to pay for each one?
Make a speed run but in reverse? Start at Bowser and make it to the beginning.
Hit them with the Earthworm Jim 100%.
That's better than some men can say
Ofc I couldn't get math autism, I got obsessed over a fictional hedgehog autism
I'm definitely a "good at English, bad at math" girlie
And yet sometimes I talk so fast I stumble over my own words
I liked math and was good at it, and was good at writing but HATED it
I do have this one problem
I get like blindness when I see too many variables at once
Calc 2 is the highest math I've taken so idk
Like a bunch of different numbers put together
awww, did it make you dizzy?
I keep having dreams I'm back in college
(i'm honestly really curious, I don't know how you'd teach just fuzzy logic for a semester)
Like I keep taking new courses
I think fuzzy logic is actually kinda useful for modeling AI imo
Are there customization options for dreams
that's honestly really cool that it worked well for that
I wonder if Eldstar ever needs to shave
Like does his beard just stay like that
gl to you phantom, Ima be lurking 👀
Question, how did Goombas put on those Spike hats
.....that must've been one painful pregnancy
Isn't Jr. Troopa's spike canonically from a spiked Goomba?
@mariomantaw That's gruesome if they were both with it on them
Just ripping part of someone's body off of them and attaching it
That is the smallest train I've ever seen
It's like if a delivery truck didn't have the storage on the back
I wonder if anyone thought Parakarry had blue eyes
Parakarry, the rare blue eyed Paratroopa
Still waiting on the sleeves I ordered
Most likely will be here by Monday
DOOD is probably going to be a sneak peek I was wavering on going to but now that it has Rose Dragons and some stealth Dark Magician support
Yeah a new Link 2 that helps out Dark Magician a whole lot
By basically being the glue for the engine pile of Dark Magician
Miasma Necromancer is that new Link 2
If my pokemon deckbuilding knowledge wasn't 8 years out of date I'd maybe know better lmao. All I remember is Garbodor OP.
There used to be like tools that went on enemy pokemon
I assume those don't exist anymore tho.
Gholdengo is just a dumb mon in general
Yo 4 years of pape is crazy. GL Phantom lueygaGoodLuck
yeah that's the store's problem not the service's
the delivery service can't magically make the items exist lmao
i feel ya, happens to me and like yeah, if i'm not getting charged that's fine. ain't your fault
i can't believe mario is dead
now that i'm not saving points for a big thing anymore...
some people are REALLY particular about that though
i remember when i worked at lowe's someone came to the register with a discount plant. turns out it wasn't discounted. they didn't want the plant anymore
they did not want to pay that 60 cents lmao
how many more vods are there of that
i'm guessing there's a few of those left LUL
i decided to order the one thing i didn't get at SGDQ for lunch: culver's. cause there happens to be one near me lol
also yeah i agree it is strange but i'm not complaining lmao
mmm portillos. we have one of those here too
i got to have that pope sandwich they released
can't believe every midwesterner that was subbed just canceled their sub to you smh my head
the au jus needs to be nice a flavorful
and the sandwich needs to be resilient so it doesn't dissolve in the au jus
that's how you know i know about french dips i call it au jus :P
i've had better french dips from arby's than portillo's lmfao
can't believe shadow lacks flavor and is annoying to eat
hah, i meant soggy and falling apart
it spread for sure, cause i'm norcal born and my mom got me hooked on them lol
i think the french dip is also good cause you dip it yourself. the italian beef when dipped comes that way and is kinda sticky and not pleasant to hold
and it's a sandwich so you kinda should hold it lmao
we have beef against the italian beef :P
also phantom i'm trying to eat can you please get that trash off the screen :P
yeah the italian beef is like $9-10 depending
in n out is good for the price
but outside of that it's okay
i don't like them on burgers period
I don't mind them on some sandwiches
ok i wish you was playing rando for that voice line KEKW
phantom to the new line being played "ah so you finally came"
tails offering to help with his napalm
But i can't help but laugh
just remember that in shadow 05 the president is trans
the president is voiced by maddie blaustein who was trans. also the original meowth
she also voiced omega in sonic 06
i love the recent jehtt video that explains exactly why mephiles's plan was dumb
because as shadow said in that one, "the existence of the plan necessitates its failure"
he says all time is concurrent but if that were true there wouldn't be any discussing the plan because by erasing time and time was concurrent the discussions wouldn't happen as time would be erased. time still existing in any form means his plan failed. and would always fail lmfao
Matt is coming up stairs with lemon ice tea, enjoy :)
They got one of our drinks wrong and no one will drink it because they are bitches oranLUL
No Ace is which route again?
Why would you do this to yourself
Most I remember is PW hell
okay but have you considered what I think? The Viewer?
thanks! it was great. always wanted to play this game
nice to know I can follow minish cap rando now
yesterday I rolled a solo and did every single overworld check
HUH Pokémon pocket have twitch drops
got to have a random stream open for 45 mins i guess
i do not remember that lol
i only open packs and get off KEKW
komari starting exe6, I can give the play by play LUL
I played the game recently and man, that spin badge.i see the appeal speedrunning this game lol
it was my first experience and it was a blast
now I’m split which Paper RPG is better
I also fought that Blind koopa boss I forgot the boss name. I thought the boss would be easy and I forgot to save. I had to do the WHOLE island arc again 💀
I think he after the master is the hardest boss in this game
the first time around yeah, 2nd time I used Waltz. my downfall the first time was Mario getting lucky when he would attack Mario and the partner
Mario would dodge it 💀 and it would hit my partner
i forgot about this room lol
i just checked my first run of this
my prologue was a 22:20 and my log skip split was a 1:26:34
i think if i wasn't in call with mx4, i would have reset long before that 1:26 lmfao
I've only done log skip one time and was just like, nope never again LOL
I don't remember what I was doing it on tbh
i should come back and do time out for this run
wait, it's a JP only trick, isn't it?
I wonder. is it possible to get multiple of those spin badges?
maybe I did try it on Wii U then PrideLaugh
the big one for this run is mainly just item duping
damn I was just imagining how much faster you could go
i think that trick alone make or breaks routes cuz of how easy/reliable duping
that would be resting in the inn here in ch5 right
i only remember that part of the route cuz i think it's funny that resting at the inn is optimal
i was under the impression it was 2 but i guess only doing risky strats will do that to me
as much as this run sucks, i love how fast it is
while still playing at least a little bit of the game
oh i remember now, i thought it was 2 repels cuz i did a pape races run of this and grabbed an extra for safety
what would you say is the hardest boss in this game?
3 transform is jump x2, jump x1
oh not the master? that’s interesting take nodders
do you have 10 or 15 hp rn
does the 3 anti guys count as a boss fight?
i was gonna say, don't get 2% on duplighosts Kappa
true, get the damage boost and and the magic damage boost and you can shred him
I agree lol my first playthrough I was loaded with life shrooms and wappa bumps and those 3 boogers took all my items lol
it’s weird how that blind koopa was my only game over 😭😵 smh
do they sleep for differing amounts of turns or no
80%? We’ll I must be the most unlucky mother trucker
i know there's a 1 turn difference between time out and lullaby on hallway
Literally me. I brute forces it haha
used waltz and I had rng magic power ups
honestly losing a run to kent while having bow is so stupid
man. I sware to beat his butt my 2nd playthrough
bro living rent free in my head
omg you can farm powerups here
in the risky routes you level there for sure
okay so my pb has 67exp on that fight
iirc this route defeats the hammer bro that you usually lure
i would not have caught that tbh
i feel like i remember two bullets but maybe it's been too long
oh nope, it's written like that on this route i have from m4 as well
and it's also a bullet point lmao
pape brings around some funny chatters for sure
ya know the consistency of the goombas in both rpgs being broken is pretty impressive 💀
his only meaningful fight in all speedrun categories for this game and he's sitting on his ass charging
can't make this shit up fr
hey he charged better than anyone else could LOL
i wonder how many times you could dink time out and be faster than this
let me see a delayed shield
i forget the shield turns are different on hallway
the scrolling just contributes to the time loss tbh
at least when you charge, it's like 1 outcome
really 2 outcomes but it's so shit you dont consider it
i still can't believe someone worked out all of this
this run was so bad for so long cuz no one could figure out how to make this consistent lmao
you just let bowser decide if your time was wasted :)
oh god this fight took so long cuz Bowser kept healing 💀
this fight casually is so sick
casually this fight RIPS (in a positive way)
@FatPidgeyBirb literally unkillable, he has 189hp with his heals
And you have what, 50 HP ideally if you max everything out and don't use HP plus?
yeah 50 is the max before modifiers
It feels like you're fighting a Proper Monster
this fight is a bag of tricks the whole time tbh
no tossing him three times and calling it a day
okay i thought this fight was a perfect kill so that scared me lol
i was concerned when you missed the bomb damage
is this really your first any%? or it's just been so long or a different route that you needed new splits?
with how much you play Pape I woulda imagined it woulda happened at some point
man i love this category but it's so stupid
i think he got like a 1:5x but never submitted
he was chasing 1:49 and never got it :(
AT least i made it for finale
back when 1:4x was like top 15
Had a great party and awful cleanup.
idk what the fastest safe time is in this run
if it's not m4, it's probably my 1:45
that time is so slow now with seed dupe context
I think I can say GG now
a lot of pape tricks suck
that clip made me stop playing again in those few weeks
I think you should do this again because you got SUCH a good time!
idk what happened I was tuned out for most of this
I think you should do RAC :)
all cards routing hype, all cards as a run booooo
I'm a menace and saying it just to be a menace
but also RAC is unironically my fave cat
because it is utter hot dogshit trash
i think rac is really funny.
no ace, any%, glitchless, all cards, all bosses should be the main board
i agree that it should be a CE on principle
RAC is funny in the way that watching a gladiator fight to the death is entertainiing
but it's still really, really funny that it's possible
not even tas can do it?
I was gonna post the fake 7TV 100000 bit cheer emote with the message "Play RAC" but it seems it's gone
dude i was trying to learn wii u vc any% no ace a few years ago and I got through the entire route, got good enough for a likely sub 2 first run. gave up after losing several runs to power bounces on the fucking blooper. those are so impossible on wii u
but like unironically power bounces were the single worst part of the entire run, everything else was mega easy aside from like bhs i guess
Rubix lost the gless summer event race because of wii vc shit
were you still planning on monday archi?
oh yeah AP got the new version update too
I'm sad it never got finished
komari hasnt played bn1 since we did the april fools race in like 2021 lol
Gonna have dinner soon then I got my first Moogle Cup race in 2 hours so I'll miss most of this but gl with the rusn.
are you in a new house??
is it the old house you lived?
i pass there all the time and i go thats where pahntom used to live
Hey there! How is everything going?
My team just won the epic and grand 1545. What a gauntet
and yes glad the schedule worked out that way.
laserg8Smile monadoSmile phanto274Smile popesSmile waterp7SmileW u bet that will be the case
i have 2 mc doubles on the way
Yeah the only thing I like is their frosties
last time maddy and i tried ordering frosties they were trash
like the flavor was pooled all at the bottom, it wasn't even mixed, it was just the most low-effort shit
Sadly there are no DQs near where I live
Now the boba place down the street...weekly
Unsweetened coffee milk tea with extra boba
That strat is always funny to me
if you where a prime number, what would you be? and why?
aslo, i never played this geme, but is this not the one when link turns into a furry? or nha?
this will be my sleep stream
Nah.  This is the game where the final boss is just goats
I can't believe two worms just had sex on the RAF stream
witch zelda does link turn itno a femboy?
there is some shit going on in nintendo
Into a femboy?  If the internet has taught me anything link is a sword lesbian.
does link not dress in like girls clothing for a mission in one of the games?
link = femboy confirmed, brb drawing fanart
And then the internet got mad they removed it in the second one
link dresses as a gerudo voe to infiltrate geurdo city
they have literally no way of telling with gorons tho so gorons get free reign lol
it wasn't needed in totk cuz link had the gerudo pass
Not what i expected to hear
is it not faster to run the game in another language? to make the dialoge go faster, or am i thinking about another game?
oh wow, it looks like i know something
omg he is a good boy now!
speedrunners deserve more cred then they get tbh. good on you man, its impressive.
there's multiple almost drowning areas in this game that makes me wonder how the fuck they designed the game in such a way to even make this route possible
all lines up so perfectly lol
why is link not always a good boy, i dont know the lore
No I mean like even the pillar clip
if that pillar was just slightly further it wouldn't be possible
morpheels boss room is just the right size to not drown
I think you'd drown before you hit the cutscene otherwise
What else would I play LUL
we back to regular scoob he beat the scooblocke
Yeah I've been grinding down a category to submit to Collectathon
I want to submit to more events tbh
I would love to speedrun this game but that sounds like a lot of time to jsut learn the route LUL
The game is just very demanding and volatile
As a viewer I love watching it tho
I think I would do like IL's or shorter cat extensions if I were to learn the game
Wait this actually looks good I didn't know this category existed
Dude shorter cat and you play temple of time GIGACHAD
At least it isn't early snow peak in HD NiceSoftlock
Who up here grooming thy lycaon
i love that he just fucking bowls link over
lots of mistakes, but i pb'd
I'd like sub 2:50 but im not gonna hold myself to it for now
rn 52 or 51 is fine, if i feel liike continuing grinding i will keep going
yeah tp is like you can have a perfectly good run and then one small mistake ruins the pace
well maybe a lot of runs are like that idk, i dont run too many games
In here it's not don't worry it'll get better, it's don't worry it could've been a lot worse KEKW
i wasnt paying attention do you have to do ebf dangoro here?
oh wait prob not cause you bite after rang
i meant do you have ebf when you fight dangoro, so that the fight starts instanntly and you cant do the setup strat
wii ad has to do that
You got hit by Fyrus YOU
Might be the worst boss they ever designed tbh
Then again a lot of bosses in this game are ass imo
EASY TIME SAVE for next time
When will u jump to stallord skip?
At least i get to see my fave dungeon but yeah ultimately on u. Gonna have my dinner now
how is 9 dungeons different from all dungeons? do you not do Hyrule castle?
oh good I’m not too late
I gotcha. I was at work. got sent home early because I slid across the floor and fell on water. 😂
just a sore butt cheek and a bruise on my leg. no broken bones at least.
i am good on that thanks lmao
You should go fuck yourself on that
still cant believe hes a 3d runner now
there you go ice, your new hot run after chrono trigger
just remember, it's not a zelda run until a keese fucks you up
Yo. I'm back from my tournament match. I'm undefeated, neva laust... for now at least. LUL
it was an awful seed and I had some pretty bad luck on top of it but a win's a win ig LUL
wow speaking of awful luck :(
What an unfortunate way to end the run. Hope u a nice rest of day. Looking forward to the Showcases.
I took a nap today, I wonder why?
Surely because I wasn't up at 4 AM playing [REDACTED]
10 TP seed would take a month
switching between seeds in TP would be so much more annoying I feel like.
That's so funny considering like... how popular it is
I feel like people don't usually struggle to have people watch them when playing it so surprising to hear
it'd be interesting if someone did a swap between 1 seed of every single Zelda game. Altho given that many of them would have to be diff emulators idk if that would be possible to automate...
Link can't roll over 3 inch ledges ig LUL
Well SM64 it's just how ceilings and floors are done being stupid LUL
Gross, I feel that heat tho, I got the same around me
Yeah it was 97 where I'm at today, and a lot more than 4% humidity lmao.
That's the hardest trick in the entire game
What is the lore on Jake
my boss said I can work a mid tomorrow, so I'm definitely getting weed and a burrito after work tomorrow
Nintendo just made 3 lap races in Mario Kart World more common lol
Yeah they effectively rolled back intermission races being more common
a finger curls on the monkeys paw as i go into the vod...
lemme read zsr but yes its something stupid
i would argue that zsr is not totally clear
basically you need to pull it straight back from fyrus, you pulled it to his side
but zsr just says "away", which could be interpreted radially
howdy hey, hope the run is going well!
i don't think i do that at all, lemme check my vod and input viewer, i imagine i throw to the right and probably go neutral
i don't touch the control stick after the backflips until i'm climbing the ledge
at which point i ofc hold up
how rough is the second armos clip manip
it was one i didn't try originally
oh you got red sword didn't you
i can def do the first one, with the kinstone manip on top
the only hard part of the first manip imo is the slash turns into the lever pull
cuz you have to be fast enough to get the armos to not move at all to get the kinstone
the default ladder emoji is hype
and other statements that would confuse basically anyone out of context
idk what other people would call it even
but thats like calling DSS "superjump"
there's the wii spot already in lakebed
but KB2 skip is a step clip using eponas head
A huge congrats are in order!
U were awsm and love the commentary vibes.
When is AG not taking a dump
What is it with me and getting to the dungeon I hate the most
That conditional being the key word
spiderwatch is on high alert monkaS
Its sky Time the fight for the run starts now
the roll off of that is like, down left
pet the dagron? nah, I'MA KICK IT IN THE DICK
tried my hand at just using UT for minish cap tonight. Went most good but I peeked at it a few times
using universal with pop tracker gets confusing cause quite a few check names dont match up
ive had a good experience with banjo check names at least
for example for deepwood the tracker uses 1F, B1, B2... while AP uses F1, F2, and B2
i mean B1 at the end
"blue rupee chest" yea sure i know what that chest has in vanilla
im just eager to learn the checks and logic so i dont have to think abouut location names
so majoras mask has taken a backseat for me
when I get something like that I check my hints first to at least guide me
i mean other people hinting stuff yeah
im ready for tomorrow, i redeemed for someone to play book of mario LUL
i hate this phase so much
It's the Barry Sanders of horses.
what i hate too is sometimes he just get into a loop of chasing after you and you can't do anything about it really
i know the technical part of it, but i think the phase is just bad casually
dylanjWave tippiWave monadoWave phanto274Wave Excellent time.
I'm gonna rip a celebratory fart just for the run finishing
Ironic timing for the stream to die
i'm happy i got my new emotes in
Finally out of ad hell lol
phantom, i got it to work. I just went its doing this wrong, now its doing this other thing wrong, and now its stable LUL
i now have a proper angy emote
LINKS? but you got pape in not TP
im just glad I didnt have to ask you for help with it. Im sure you wouldnt mind but id have no idea what Im doing.
So what are the settings if this is not base 2/3?
Hmm, I wonder if we'd ever consider re-closing Prologue for races
Oh, also chat isn't on screen
The first one being spooky is on brand
i'm gonna hide an important item and we should play keep away from DANG
I think the big factors in opening Prologue were nerfing Super Hammer and deleting Goomba King
See now I'm just imaging starting with base 0 item inventory until you find pouches.  Make it even harder after removing jump/hammer
GK at least has less cutscenes in minimal, not sure how people feel about the extra fights or gearbalancing though
hey SS check out my new emotes mirbysAngy mirbysO7 mirbysHug mirbysSmug mirbysLUL
Vanilla?  In our rando?  Reroll time
the hardest part was deciding if mirbysO7 should be O7 or Salute as the code lol
So far this seed has been pretty tame
unfortunately i'll be missing out on Pax West this year, but i'm gonna try to go to TwitchCon/GDQx
What else did you submit besides pape?
i gotta think about what to submit this time
Ah.  I've been enjoying the 1 runs.
Even the upcoming changes aside, I dig the NPCs at the top of the tracker
Oh it's fully random monkaS did not realize
At least it's not something like 9 fp squirt of sushi
You predict dungeon shuffle for s5?
Hey kooper.  We have your shell.
See I was joking about the random fp costs since I didn't know it was actually enabled
I think that's where I was remembering the random over costed squirt vs lava pirhana
During fully random BP they're still capped at 6, since I found 1-8 without biasing to be obnoxious
Yeah, fully random eas never intended for competition, lol. It was an interesting choice for sure
I wouldn't be opposed to random fp but it has a chance to be +-1 of original.  So some randomness but it's workable
Great minds think alike then haha!
The fp costs have like locked this seed.  Gross.
Even after all this time I'm still unsure if the 10% for fully random during balanced random was a good idea
Since you almost always only notice it if something gets unreasonably expensive
I don't mind the 10%.  It's low enough it's not gonna screw over every ability on a single partner even if one is bad
Oh for a showcase it's really bad I agree
Dungeon entrance shuffle w/ LCL tends to sometimes just run long during generation. Something about placing dungeon entrances first can cause some rerolls
oh my god they got david hasslehoff back to spongebob for the trailer for the new game
I guess 2 with late hammer?
I'm hoping I finally made the perfect spreadsheet so I can put it to rest
Shows how much i know, lol
Sup Phantom, grats on getting into PAX tippiSway
Yo grats to you too AVP
Cheer5 I will spam this until you make an alert (I won't actually).
So its 8 min in and you have all your friends????
free five cents is what they called me coming out of college
That's more or less what I want for season 5. On the fence of another panel season vs merlow logic
Yeah vague hints might make it less of a mess as season 3 so im leaning towards that
nintendo: have a whale in a game that you can't go inside of challenge impossible
I kinda want to do a season4.5 or something with co-op/some other various weird thing
Bossess arent shuffled or anything right?
Co-op sounds fun. Surprised no one stepped up to do an off season thing like people wanted
Does pape have multiworld support yet?
yeah I think everyone just expected someone else to step up and do that
Uh, I watched a playthrough of TTYD one time. That's enough, right? avarie1Clueless
I both want to know the context and don't about why Mario's ass would be sore.
The only difference is it has better partners.  It doesn't have the burden
Is there an easy way to play this game?
I mean that is only a little over an hour drive away from me
Hmmmm I do have a WiiU
I speedrun BioShock Infinite, I was born in the input delay, buddy.
yeah it is 75$ for one day or 260 for the whole event
Yo, good luck at PAX. New PB at PAX? VoteYea
A lot of people have been begging for trick list to be changed since we've been using the same list since season 2
Adding new stuff really. They wanna do stuff like skilling pulse stone etc...
Ive been asked to allow lp skip lmaoooo
I also think that there should be a rule where if both racers agree to  something that it should be allowed/enabled  even if it normally isn't
That could solve a lot of headaches for people wanting different things.
Wouldnt allow unrestricted,  but could do race rules with gentleman aggreements to add stuff lime pulse stone skip and such
no tricks enabled mandatory mirror mode so people cant complain it isnt a fresh rule set SeemsGood
or we could try a draft for different settings or something
Even if badges suck at least you have all your friends
i only have 5.9 friends iceblueBigsad
@Swiftalu is laki really not your friend to
there's nothing wrong with the .9 friend he's just really short
i would just to be contrarian
"Fuck the cake mix I have cake"
i cant get the normal skip for that ultra block to work so i have to use clippy and crawl around its dumb how consitent ive gotten at it now lol
Uhhh, I don't think I've ever paid attention to that
Wait why does this chapter have a boss?  I thought you just got the star for free.
@crimsonkn what can't you get to work for the normal skip?
i dont have a good controller for angles i think is my issue but i can get clippy and jump around the top
which part are you messing up
i cant land it after the ledge no matter what i try im assuming its just a controller issue as i said
have the trick rules even changed since you came up with that google doc
I mean what if someone were to accidentally get on sushie at that exact postion  Kappa
Im also probably considering allowing jumping on koopa to get ultra boot block in sewers
also logic question if the clippy tricks are enabled does it include for the tree ledge and tree in prolog? since its super free
TIL Rigby is a pape runner Flushed
Yeah, I was a top 10 runnsr until SOMEONE beat me. I cant remember who
How would I when I didn't even know he ran the game
Nowadays I just run the rando league
yeah vanilla is kinda dead ngl
there NOW you have every partner
not a single one you're missing
Just finished ur GDQ vid. That was epic
Risch and ice should team up more often
clearly this trick shouldn't be allowed Kappa
Thinking about it, since we are dungeon  shuffle this season, I might allow pulse stone skip and raph skip too
Gee, if only there were a badge that made you immune to status effects!
Just thinking of allowing easier access to some dungeons just to see what they are
I did like the 0-star-required seeds I sentenced Adam to a while back.
Race with dojo does sound miserable
dojo in logic for blitz when?
Really good room tbf.  Not needed but nice.
but will they all cost 8 BP?
Can we get an option for the rando to include Book of Mario text? With required quizzes and letter delivery rewards?
GL and grats on getting into pax rischBless
I mean, I'll be alive in the Seattle area for sure LUL
I haven't been in a few years, the last time I went I just walked around for a bit, started to get a migraine, and left
I think it was like, the first one since the pandemic, so like 2021 or 2022?
Nice of the game to hand you 2 more damage on your feet
laki clips could maybe be allowed to seeing as they arent that hard
because there is also like warehouse key skip and kooper skip (with laki)
so Dungeon Shuffle with LCL only shuffles in logic dungeons?
make an any% category and a glitchless category LUL
Yeah thats what id be worried of, I would want to add stuff to allow access to dungeons early so you can see what was randomized but im not sure yet
I mean with just laki clips laki alone doesn't do too much
Potential ch 5 access is the big one
I mean laki clips don't help you really skip any c5 stuff
1 hr slammaroo and my chilli is done
I could see c7 sushie glitch being allowed to
To be fair though,  cake mix is often early enough in logic so 9 times out of 10 you'll have cake by the time you decide to come here
personally I dislike when a trick is banned just because it skips too much even when it isn't hard at all to do
When I did a poll last season, literally 0 people voted for random puzzle lmao
IMO I would be fine with mystery note being required but none of the other random puzzles
the rule set to me is a slippery slope
but i dont like pay to play or cash out for top 5 like OOT
I mean the way I think about it having glitches allowed enables more decision making which is better, the issue is just when not everyone knows all the glitches
Only tricks I learnt I did when I was actively running the game
Didn't learn anything for the rando
I mean there is also certain people that do actually learn glitches to and the issue is pleasing both crowds
like I mainly quit joining league because I wanted to do glitches in my seeds
I can probably count on 1 hand the amount of current rando runners who've also played vanilla speedruns
finding settings to appease everyone is next to impossible, I deal with it in KH2 rando as well
And 2 of those 3 are glitchless runners
I am sure that at least some of the people would be willing to learn more tricks if they were allowed
i mean active people is low, there is so many people in the kh2 rando discord
Yeah not a lot of people are as willing lol
I mean not too many but at least some
like, learning tricks would be nice but how often will they be allowed in league is the question, learning something to just not be allowed to use it feels bad for most
oh my god is that bowser?!?
yeah I feel like if a lot of glitches are allowed you would want to up it to at least 5 chapters
I hate it when microsoft windows slows down opening toybox :(
Yeah season 5 looking pretty similar to these settings
my new emotes came in ice :3
i'll mark your star rod phantom
If you wanna send it now
wow Amazon missing out on free money.
I was told if I ever get front page again, to turn on 20 minutes of ads
ad from the past huh iceblue69LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
yo how we still got mirrored webcams in the year of our lord 2025?
Just make a casual 500 dollars off ads lol
at that point it's basically a secret stream
if your'e subbed or have turbo you get to watch but if you don't and are idling on front page thanks for the free money!
just mirror your whole stream then Kappa
I did that for an april fools stream once
i have plans for the next april fool's, i am gonna play a GBC game that may not actually be beatable lol
only sushi i eat now is shrimp other latest was scallops
the only thing goombario has ever been good for is memeing on
Who left this Bow out to dry dock
but how else will you make mushroom risotto tonight
For sale one turtle in a cloud
What was the only Nintendo series to really fall flat? Paper Mario
@Mirby_Studios He probably has a Watt locked in his cellar too lmao.
Oh yeah my sleeves came in for my cards
Yeah the chronicles Sky Striker sleeves
I want to make a more modern Dark Magician Deck but need to wait for DOOD to come out with some support for that deck
Yeah the Link 2 Miasma Necromancer
It also helps that I want to build Rose Dragons too
IDK if Rigby told you but he posted a thought for next season which is mostly what you have but with panel shuffle and vague hints
1 more HP than you needed
Oh sweet, you finally regained the will to play Pape rando
Luigi invites Mario over to play some Nintendo Switch... ...as they get ready to fire up some Smash Bros. Mario notices Luigi has a new avatar.  Mario asks, "Say, Luigi, what kind picture is that?"  Luigi says... "It's a Mii, Mario."
Rando? I was Randoed once... In Mario, Paper mario, in a Paper mario rando, it made me randoed
doing rando at Pax is crazy
I might’ve gone to PAX West if I didn’t already go to East this year
the only two people i really know who got into pax for runs are both doing mario related runs lol
If I had pto, and flying to seattle wasn't 300 quadrillion dollars, i'd go
Flying to Boston was only $130 for me since I’m in PA, Seattle would be a couple dollars more than that probably
yeah shas got in with wario land 4 normal any% zipless
you left the dirt in goomba village
he's standing next to his sister
may i offer you a nice egg in this trying time
Just ban me now I'm so sorry :(
Question! When do you think you'd be ending stream? (don't rush for my sake) we just have a semi large package outside that is heavy and it's been out there since yesterday oranLUL
So I finally ordered my desk last weekend
and then yesterday they discounted it $40 :(
Gotcha!! That's what I figured lol, it's like.. 80 pounds x2 and large so neither Shen and I can do it unfortunately oranCry
Shen was like "I can lock in" and I go.. "no don't please LOL"
It's an L-shaped so I think it's two 48x24 segments
just give me like... 10 hours
Oh no it's 160 pounds and really large haha
yea 2 separate boxes each 80 pounds I think tapped together LOL
oh shit i didn't know you could skip that one too
So the frame already arrived, the desktops should arrive tomorrow so fingers crossed
Because I really would like to get my computer set back up
Although I had to wait on getting a new chair
Money getting tight and I'm not feeling great about where work is at ATM
But it's okay Phantom! They suggested using AI to cope with your unemployment
Which you can pay for as part of your Bing Subscription
So, I currently work in tech and ngl I kinda hate myself for it now LUL
(I laugh so I don't cry :( )
Did they replace you with AI?
You mean all the things that a company would love to know about you for completely altruistic purposes?
And certainly not all for manipulative tactics?
But yeah I'm trying to get out but it's been very difficult especially with everything going on
But hopefully labor day sales will make chair more affordable
For now I went with a standing desk stool which came today and was super cheap. It's alright, and it beats standing all the time, but no backrest or anything to relax
tbf I said that before you said Pax, my default state is to just doubt myself YEP
But yeah, hopefully labor day sales Prayge
You are crazy AND there's 2
8bp for both power plus and mega rush is just disrespectful
Yeah that should be illegal lol
also hey man how's the randomizer wolfyh2Wooper
my gf and i have been going through ttyd for the first time and we were both devastated to see quick change was 7bp
been lurking since.... since you were talking about how Rigby was the only person could touch you in rando league
it was her favorite because she likes tattling it hurts lmao
didn't know that was an attack
i have also never seen that attack
making tacos atm. Thinking about it, I make tacos a LOT
what is the benefit of getting power jump exactly
that's where i left my nuts
me when i'm considering an orchiectomy "i really don't want all these nuts"
This Ruins couldn't be deader lmao
will you have to go back to fight tutankoopa at some point?
right yeah one more key, i forgor wolfyh2Wooper
it's not cheating it's just ignoring the rules!
that's what you get for thinking of cheating
yeah that's why you gotta go back around
Who's up dreamin of cheating in they rando tonight 👀
it's right there in the text message
POLICE ARE ILLEGAL CALL IN THE DANCING LOBSTERS
Diamond stone is on digdogger in level 5
I ate it, sorry did you need it
I can get it back to you in 2-3 business days
I'm not about to shit at the speed of light over some ronk I ate
this sounds like a sponsor for Miralax
(From the side of the frame) I hate cherry!
ate your diamond stone? try Miralax! phanto274Smile
everything always is in cherry and I hate it
i would rather eat a tub of sand then have anything artificial grape flavored
orange can be pretty bad too
tho, I guess that's kind of how we got into this situation in the first place, except the sand is in collected, single ronk form
someone out there would do it too
i was JUST about to ask if you were hungry phanto274Lurk
I'm considering a bowl of cereal
the ronk didn't exactly whet my appetite
i have dinner being made, chicken drumsticks with some potatoes wolfyh2AYAYA
geez Lakilester looks like a ninja turtle. or sick
Tomorrow I get to test out the blackberry jam I made from the fresh berries out back
:( So rude of the passion fruit smh
I thought you were gonna say Passionfruit pantheon
I am very Normal (Celeste Pilled)
Passionfruit Pantheon is the name of the Grandmaster Lobby in Strawberry Jam, which is a Celeste mod
Yeah just drop your run from pax honestly
who up blooping their rando rn
that would be so tragic LUL
I might be able to think of one thing but it may count as backseating to say
I was gonna say when you left that it's totally gonna be on Pokeys LUL
altho idk if it'd work very well on the stone chomps
ugh. I should do witch shit but I dun wanna
oh gdi I got here right at the end. Stupid work AngyTwink
oh I did a rando the other day. I got some really good reads into where I needed to find items, but still got a 3:15 3:
I think I had to double dip some places
nerdCheck 1st still haven't been redeem
What do you need star peices for?
Oh star peices are in logic too?
Kinda. I dont want  situation where a seed has exact amount if star peices for something
Without doing something cringe for it
I can leave it on if it isnt that bad
Yeah I'll do the same when I play the settings, I wont do pulse stone skip or anything immediately
It doesnt even seem bad in practice either having panels and merlow logic
Merlow without panels become get superboots and you have your merlow item
I am like halfway through assembling
I am now tired and am taking a break until next year
This is a very open seed
Literally 5 places you can go
Yeah ch 5 dungeon seems really good atm since its on the way and logic is pointing towards ruins
Im definitely gonna forget 50 coin blocks
Desert unironically are the ones ill remember
Ill just be in S4 mode and ignore them
you got a baby rando lmao. everythings one tap
So just a bomb for go
I forget,  is that check ruins completion specifically or ch 2 in general?
Yeah I expect 1:4x to be the average
Toybox in general is nerfed a lot with block coins
Green station without parakarry gonna feel really bad now
The panels oddly matter more with merlow logic than being checks themselves
If my console turns on ill try
i put more spaces than that but twitch said no
Funny getting a partner from Goombario
@Rgamer0 "here's someone more useful than me"
Only half of the holes are where I need them
So like. The 4 on the edge of the frame are in the correct place. But the ones in the middle just don't exist
Like, there isn't even a hole in between the edges that would suggest I did something wrong :(
According to many reviews it seems this is not an uncommon issue
I think I just put in the edge ones, and then I'll try to get the other ones in somehow
You would think/hope that, but alas
crazy seed so far. Wild item placements
We like "not bad" seeds around here
seed is on the vase Nodders
it's s5 settings, progression always on vase
Ok, so I finally found a user assembly video and they were basically like "Yep these holes aren't pre drilled, just drill them in"
we gotta submit Pape Rando to next years Evo tbh
But at least I didn't do anything wronf
Yeah basically it sounds like they reuse the tops with multiple frames, so they just drill common holes and different mounting options but they don't always line up for all frames
Get what you pay for I guess
Ngl what was even more dumb was they say how it's all reversible except with their support brackets you can't fit the two wood pieces next to each other in all options
So like basically I have one laying down as the long side of the L, the short side can only stick out on one side
So like they have all these unused holes for all these options except the one I wanted and also not for the frame I specifically bought it with
But again. I guess I can't complain too much for what I paid compared to other option
Like basically. The way I originally wanted was for the long side to against my wall, with the small side next to my door, except the top wouldn't go together that way LUL
based streamer giving us more time to listen to this banger of a song
I'm planning on joining for S5, even if I get my butt whooped every time
The train in toybox was  comical because of that
I did that trying to skip ruins
I did the yellow berry stuff right after bsating 6
Since laki was in gulch, you should've had it when beating 6
Ok that made the big difference then
I had like 6 lifeshrooms so I had no problems burning them
So used 1 on jr and 1 on final
I saw you changed your name and then promptly forgor
I thought I heard a snippet of MM
is it in Chinese or Japanese
cause if it's in Japanese I can help
the bot has too much audacity
I too love the main menu cause it reminds me I am about to commit many sins and atrocities against god
marcoGL phanto274GL Let the best pape(r) win!
glhf as much as the game allows
The last 3 times Lopez completed Goombario, he got 11:03, 11:05 and 11:06 total time.
The last 3 times Lopez completed Prologue, he got 22:00, 22:03 and 22:03 total time.
he's a king he has to have modesty
blind races happen all the time so its not a farfetched challenge
And they all allude to their shadiness
back in time for the race
if I ever meet @blacktiger51 irl, we GOTTA hit each other with Yo
i got money on this race let's goooooo
oh jeez imagine a lakitu without a shell or the cloud
Spiny eggs hatch into spinies, which lakitus regurgitate. However, Yoshis vore creatures in order to make their eggs
i think they get partially stuck to build up momentum
@FatPidgeyBirb Are these eggs their young, or just ammunition?
you're their young if you survive being used as ammunition
this is like when me and Tiff have a giggle fit and can't stop laughing
Yo phantom, been loving that nightmare shuffle
how do i convince my almost 3 year old to have a pape themed birthday party over minnie mouse since she shares a birthday with pape
its been a good run lol
i THINK 5-7 years, before they added Neon to Valorant
if anybody knows when taht was
i appealed, but we'll see. "Cum" is latin for with so...
I’m home and I had to finish my game before I went to work. lol
BJs too crowded every time i go :(
nooo don't stop i will cry
why are we trying to erase paper mario even more
that's a cursed thought and i hate you for that
WHY WOULD YOU CURSE ME WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE
I NOW HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE NOW
it's literally all i want in life is for my friends to play glitchless forever
and to convert new people to glitchless
i will run glitchless this year i swear i just have like 5 sidequests and the main quest right now
you PB'd the other day right?!
12 hour celeste session the next day
and then 24 hour pape stream
and then spontaneous combustion at the end (fireworks show)
okay well 24 hour pape stream????
@GTM__ gl btw, I believe random239Bless
yeah im tryna integrate myself with toher communities more
leave the sm64 bubble and embark on a new quest of friends
yesss!! we love new friends here
bring all your friends (as long as they chill lol)
hey don't lump me in with your cynicism
i've truly never made fun of anyone ever in my life
youve never been evil for fun?
@GTM__ hehe of course not :3
wow I also resent that statement
arie you just lost friendship/romance points
do you prefer vanilla or randomizer phantom?
golden deer is that even a question
if you join that churchy bitch I am judging you
dw im here to provide entertainment
to make it feel like running glitchless is worth it
plus i'm just catching lobsters on runescape
I better get to bed. I have to work at 10am. hopefully I can catch your next stream phantom. have good night everyone. phanto274Sleep
Dude you fucking risked it all
GLHF Phantom megaFlushed yo blopez gl
I saw you were playing last night
When you playing next? Ill hop on next session
After another jamboree wr, I need something to do
Took me 3 finished runs to get all minigames wr
BEAT THE CRAP OUTTA BL- I mean yo gl
why did it send that emote
I don't randomly get those Ads I research them smilers
I'm an expert on coq, does that count?
Just play Mario Kart as bowser and win both
I think this race is healing my soul a little bit
It feels so nostalgic all my homies hanging out over pape serend17Sad
I miss when phantom ... 😳
i can't believe phantom is alive
this game can't just let people have a GOOD NIGHT for ONCE
one of these days I need to do a random glitchless run, just to see if I beat my old time KEKW
Damn I should be in Las Vegas right now
My brothers are drunk and huddled around a tv watching High School Musical
I did enjoy watching it after having not seen it in years
I just heard my brother shout about Italian racism in the film
this guy bopped me on an average run
ty stream, both of you random239Love
ty for the euphoria of watching glitchless
I was in the bathroom and busy doing stuff. Can you do Ch. 8 again? :)
just do the whole game again
oh no i can't watch it from the UK
Nice solid race. Sad about u not winning but fun nonetheless. Hope u have a great rest of day.
Do all of the dungeons, but fast
So apparently I need to warranty the desk, so this has been a fantastic weekend 4Head
They don't even know they're not required
Ayo, a DVD? We're gonna watch a movie?
This movie is called The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess: All dungeons (quickly): A speedrun tale
i hope its not a tamer
not a fan of that genre
oh so no grinding... seems doable
play the game in 3:59 or less or i'm reenacting the movie "national treasure" tonight
shuffler has been alot of fun, and its the best way to experience BN4... 3 minutes at a time LUL
phantom did i show you the somewhat secret idea i have for my pax run
@axl_sr see...now I kinda want to do a randomizer where it's all 6 games shuffled up
check dms when you get a sec
not to be confused with the public idea, which is whatever jersey thing we're doing in the discord
@Penguin_Cuddles if only we knew someone that did something like that with a rando like... oh, i dont know... maybe paper mario?
Mr. The of Glubbers, I need to warranty my desk :(
i'm gonna do it as long as gobb signs off on it as my commentator
One of the legs is broken
i don't imagine he will, he's one of the seattle natives i go out with, with momo/variety/req
so i know him somewhat and it seems like he'd be down
We are gonna eat that goat.  Who's ready for kabobs?
Like it's pretty much completely defective
Based on the last few bo's.  It's gonna be a 12 slap upset
basically the only thing i want him to sign off on is not giving away the joke early
Every stream is a mid stream HypeFire /teasing
I gtg now, but good luck with the run(s) today
i never noticed that wolf link's shadow shows midna here as well, neat
i pressed enter on accident as you could tell
i regret not going this year
idk hoping that i might live closer next year if things go well
i mean the question still stands
well you could just do this category, slowly
we arent going for the fastest time, we;'re going for the longest timne
Nah clearly it's a 60k redeem.  Long speedrun or bust :p
started a new job, so lost an infinite amount of free time
i just notice no bed in background with miscelanous plushies and or cat on them
im gonna be cleaning out asbestos the next 6-8 weeks
yeah i have my abatement lisence, it is gonna suck major ass, but itll be very good money
how do you feel about season 5 settings?
ill prob join races but I dont wanna be confined to the league
working at heights, skidskeet, mini excavator, propane, acetalyne cutting, forklift, asbestos, first aid, fire watch, book seven (setting up road closure zones) and flagging and uh...  cant remember what else
season 4 I had to do 16 races... that was so dumb
i am very very overqualified for the flagging job ive been doing yes lmao
see, if you continue runs with 8 IB times, you end up 40s behind. never worth it
i never said there was causation
i really enjot that one of the game redeems for gamews to learn is fuckin... Petz Dogs 2
yeah that was a position i personally take every time
tghe best solution, just git good
pikaSmoke no this is better actually
my gold's 5:04 if you're asking what a "good" one is, likely sub 5
im gonna go do bow -> ocarina like 3 times then go finish re-learning the route, hopefully i can do a run tonight
yeah i could pretty reasonably do it today if i weren't just busy as shit
oh no I killed the run by coming in
I'm sendin some pics of stuff I got from the patio garden 'v'
I'm hoping now that they're not being choked by the mint, the rosemary and lavender starts coming in stronger
gl next run 👏 may it not die to bad and unfair tricks
i've been applying to jobs recently and i'm lowkey nervous af about interview bc of obvious reasobs
I need to start looking for a job soon again and I am not amused at the thought
everything around here is retail or warehouse and I *refuse* to go back to retail
i think I'll fine just interesting what kind of reaction the person interviewing me will have when they actually see me
outside world is overrated, stay indoors kids
wish I was a teense closer to Mass, people are normally chill there
Unfortunately the outside world is a necessary requirement to deal with life 😒
I'm considering getting a day pass, yeah
but it isn't that bad, it has bodies of water for swimming at least
Ahh, I'm in queen Anne, pretty close to the Fremont bridge
I've been in SLU briefly during an Amazon internship, then Capitol Hill the first year after college, then been in Queen Anne since
LUL yeah, I was in SLU in 2018, I think they were working on that Google building at the time
this is true there's no reason to go to SLU for me unless im for some reason getting food in SLU
I think you should do a run that goes all the way to stabbing Ganondorf YEP
I can tell you EXACTLY what he did wrong
He is guilty of two things
link engages in the hylian tradition of carrying the heusafel stone
isn't that the exact reason why he is in the twilight realm in this game?
1) He messed with Link's village. Not a major problem, except Ordon produces cheese. You don't disrupt my cheese supply chain. That's crime #1
2) He made us have to fight Zant and look at him and just generally be aware of his existance. That's crime #2
The Boulder would argue that its name is not Dwayne
THE BOULDER has no conflict with correcting his name
i've never seen a TP run before so i've never seen that wrong warp to the menu before
Listen up Gate! You may be big, but you ain't bad... THE BOULDER's gonna win this.. in a landslide
i'd say that's an average sized key
Medium keys are a terrible value
It's almost always better to upgrade to a Big Key
Or just get a Small Key and save money
my favorite part was distracting ganon with the rod
That's so funny that they just disappear fivever
I got trnarw1 A first try lmao
oh boy this stupid part that was even more tedious in skyward sword
@FatPidgeyBirb Drunk after dinner with lots of overtime on the shift this week.
hell yeah, the paycheck is gonna be lit
what was that guy that jumped off of called
midna is probably like "not quite the sword i was talking about but i guess it's fine"
What’s an Enderman’s favourite band?   Click for answer Imagine Dragons.
My cousin said he wanted “Wolfenstein” for his birthday, so I got him a stone shaped like a wolf…
Did you hear about the guy who met a Mirelurk at the bar? He’s got crabs now.
"link finish him off now with your move you have" link-"my what?"
ganondorf just laying there on the ground waiting for you put him out
Most tricks in tp look hard to be consistent at
Yo a game i actually played before
Let's see how hard the bot drops the ball
3rd times the charm syaing still exists
just make a new account EZ Kappa
@blacktiger51 I already have a main and alt
@SwiftPichu_ i have a level 60 main account
If you say miyabi I swear to fuck
I like yi xuan but that hasn't stopped me from being an Evelyn main lol
@SwiftPichu_ you got her best team tho?
damn lighter make that team nasty
Right now it's Astra yixuan and Evelyn while I get koleda running
That loses less time than what I expected
Everyone makes it out to be like losing 5 mins
damn i could get the world record for the new account speed run on star rail that doesn't sounds bad
yeah but it does have a skip story button now
my cat is so cute when she sleeps
GoldPLZ dylanjGold rubenl12RubnSkadushGold is a start
i put one of her sleeping in your server
she got a plastic bag stuck around her neck earlier today
i saw you three were on
What was the real separator in the race ?
oh so it wasnt a bad ice king or fire petey
you must have gotten really unlucky while lopez didn't
shoutout to butter and i being 2s apart
yo veil ty for the gl
yo morp ty for the gl
lopez is just too good at shaving frames in every room in the run
it adds up to so much time save
he'd probably be crazy good at all bosses
no ace is a bit more manageable only cuz it isn't as long
my pb should have been 1:3x smh
i know blockless clip is better now, it makes me want to try it again one day
i've found the game i'm good at
but i know if i play no ace, i plan to kill it as much as i can
outside of kooper skip/sun tower skip
just look at my playtime on mario kart
but the runs would be either prologue simulator or "im on the run of my life rn"
the timing for that 2nd jump attack is so weird
BIGBUGGIES my Derek all Day Long.
i love playing well and then i encounter the lilypad bugs
it's actually one of the dumbest parts of this game OMEGALUL
The Bot knows my dirty I am probably going to have romantic inclinations toward Pauline, Peach, Daisy, and Donkey Kong Classics... okay forget Donkey Kong Bananza and I have some kinda crazy with the sword
my brain is too brain rotted for MM, running this game was a lot of fun though
MM just itches my brain in a way that idk if another game can or will
but phantom air tricking is slow it delays your trick boost when you nd
there are really bonkers fast strats though on like every actual track
wait you grab stuff with the ball loool
the longer i stay away from this game the more i miss it
the mm equivalent of what just happened was snowball on snowhead.
I know this run is a pain, but we are still rooting for you to break a PB.
I return with homemade CHIKI NUGGIE (and homefrie)
makes less sense because there are usually less graphemes for basic english text they could have wrote this game in ascii
man it gets claimed like 25 times over
I'm BACK IN THE FUCKING SEWERS
Link is hiding his kink side apparently
is this another run since the one i was at earlier
the whiplash when i first encountered this cutscene lmao
Nintendo told RTA in Japan they need licenses to feature Nintendo games in their marathons
How the hell do people find these HypeLol
wait, if its been 9 years I should have more cchannel points
ill be doing more shuffler later LUL
bro, my streamerrs start at noon, I need a consistent 9-noon
I was rewatching my delete quickman submission. its still WR. It was just a regular run but had a sub 30 quickman which was crazy for me back then.
guess who is now a masterballer in pokemon PogChamp
so you could improve it phanto274ColonD
that must mean im the worlds best pokemon player
then you had people grind that category only for over a year
"i yearn for life outside the gate"
a truck almost tboned me the only thing he thankfully did was break the fender some and scratched up the car some
I just don’t like to drive because I’m not the problem other people are lol
now I’m going to listen to stream and take a nap.
Midna looks like she has a very uncomfortable saddle
then it's a very bad airbag
Proposal: We need a standard email line that slaps the other person when they're being an idiot
Well then maybe people should stop being idiots NODDERS
ooo I can make emotes. I’ll have to come up with something unique
maybe my son can come up with something I’m not very creative but he is.
right I’ll do that after my nap
I need to stop playing scooby
I need to speedrun other games
True every game I play must have a dog in it
go back to dog island then
I'm stoopid I don't remeber that
you are just too goated to practice damn
I wish that were me Sadge
Can't make up my mind about something so help me out here
Oh shit that's this month?? Awesome
i took a vacation there once and just let myself get lost
Apparently its Owl Awareness Day. "A hoot-tastic day...."
I gotta head out but I'll catch you later evo17Hiyo
shower though i just had: doesnt ai very explicitly direspect gpl licenses? zfgThink
remember when it got delayed like 5 times because of major security issues
or how it absolutely MURDER ssd
yea but that was just insane lol
first beta of recall did so much read write it reduced the lifespan by like 10x or something crazy
their answer would be "reinstall windows"
Gonna unlurk to say def in some mood for some pape but Battlenetwork wasnt an option
theres so much random bugs they just don't care anymore
is there something youd rather :)
pape any% how long is it not familliar with modern any%
ok wasnt sure if it was like ace credit warp lol
figured thats what it was but wanted to make sure
Madge time to redo the poll Kappa
havent watched pape any% in years
it did volcano glitch over and over
Bitch you know it wouldn't have
What if I gave a fuck
am I just speaking up? I've been lurking since I was dm'ing you
do you think if they ever remake this game theyll make goomba king a secret superboss?
I love your streams of Paper Mario
would you want to race again Saturday
finally achieved sub 3 in smrpg breezy
and probably acquiring a switch 2 this month
im looking forward to a lag free Boomer
the amount of Shockers I have dropped on Boomer...
anyways i need to stretch the leggies after that so brb
no resetting until blooper, my pizza will be done then
can i have the tunder bolt then?
Im trying to get discussion going for the league. We have 2 weeks to finalize and you know how much input like to weigh in with LUL
remember when M4 submitted settings and no one said anything so that became the ruleset then people complained?
yea this didn't exist in the route i watched
yea ok i don't even know what route i watched then KEKW
reminds me of lets go mount skip, can only be done with specific controllers
@Axl_SR nyacinthsNerdge it can be done with any but good luck
much like many tricks in 3d zeldas were considered TAS only for a while before someone crazy enough made it rta viable
MM Lullaby skip with ONLY Goron rolling without pause buffering is one such (lets be real its still not rta viable)
i can't insist on how cursed that trick is btw because wind cycles are rng
now im really eager for archipelago 0.6.3 to drop
yea looked it up WR doesn't have glitchless lullaby skip still KEKW and its been years since it was made "rta viable"
a PR got merged recently to adds in game hints to the hint client. My days of writing down banjo hints are over!
it was allowed, then banned, then allowed, then banned, then allowed
maybe it was banned again monadoShrug
MultiServer: CreateHints command (Allows clients to hint own items in other worlds) > Pull request successfully merged and closed
Hey Phantom, if you could keep Sushi as a pet, would you?
Well hey at least you could have someone to talk to if your ever gaming alone! :)
I can't believe this isn't ACE
wow, no ACE? well what if I am Ace? phanto274Leave
how are yoshis still alive this volcano is crazy active
Goombario the real hero in this game
bowser forgot how to breath fire
The problem is that Bowser is not that bright.
i love boss fight speedrun notes that are 5 pages long
sounds like they could stand to make it a little more concise
you should see my notes for the final boss of Stella Glow, turn 1 it branches off into like 5 different path lmao
yea, a lot of wildly different things
he's fr whipping out the star rod with these lightnings
this was an outrageous pattern from what i came into
one big peach warps split is the wave
My pitch for BN7, HBD is real, but what if Yuuichiro exaggerated Hub’s condition to justify digitizing him? Maybe Hub wasn’t going to die right away—and Yuuichiro made the call anyway. Lan knew, kept the secret, and Patch only learns the truth decades later after finding HBD.LOG in some old files.
I found some old fan theories about yuuichiro and expanded on it. Patch doing it is my original idea
imagine BN as a visual novel KEKW
i never bought the DVDs but I do still have the manga
like bass fuses with flazar for example
i dont remember that much from the manga but I do know Sean was used a lot more
when lan visits yuuichiro in the hospital
they've had it too good for too long
it was only used as a way to teach Lan to aton for his crimes of setting Scilab on fire.
In BCC he is freezeman's net op
Hii Phantom str9ngLove str9ngLove how are you?
I'm doing pretty good, just about to move next week so been working on getting ready for that. Miss your streams str9ngSadge
Luckily only an hour away from where i am now, so not too bad
Rivals 2 pushed out an update with a bug where certain characters can freeze their foes forever just by using a throw
After being at EVO of all things
Yup! So looking forward to it! Hope i can make it to your streams more often retrop32Free1
Buddy saw the emote someone else had today and said "yo me too" swifSmug
Oh lmfao I'm thinking of the spinner emote
I can't wait to squish them like a pancake
But you should still consider the legs :)
God I hate the ad timer cause it never works
I should probably do that but my last time tangoing with CSS was back when I was on dA swifOld
The first time I played pokepark 2 I had just gotten my braces on, ah memories
I can't believe colo is losing now in that one poll
Nah you should do all snags so I finally make the sheet for it
now this is a good stream title
Which would be poetic, because that's what I got partnered off of
It's losing by 1 point anyways
why are there so many one framers in this game
i dont think about them until i miss all of them in a split and im like, why did i lose more than i thought
Yo fuck that guy in particular
I actually really hate this bridge segment too
Horse back riding is so jak
I have in fact done it and it is no where near that jank 😩
btw I was wondering what is the most beginner friendly TP category? I was suggested All Mirror Shards
good resources, do a few runs over a month and get to show it off for a race
yeah thank you, thinking of running an event and want to have some options for people who want to participate
its weirdly well received as one
yeah, AMS is also not my favorite because it's a... mid game? category?
you neither start at the start or end at the end
AFS is also notably harder than AMS
@TheGlubbers yeah the problem is just that its going to be over 3 hours, we are looking for 30min to 2hour runs
category extensions are fine, they just need to have decent resources for learning
Pirate ArrTA I also heard is good
other games categories we have as ideas are ALTTP NMG, OoT GSR, SSHD Harp
Looking for something for WWHD that is easier than Any% No MSS
was alright, got a ~50s PB in No IBG, tried another then some any%
@Myth197 AMS is a solid one then, it can be done largely* glitchlessly
*all the glitches required are trivial
it seems like for long categories, the best way to practice everything is to just do runs lol
i used to stream practice but not so much anymore
unless you know where to look
bsky is better because thats where all the cool trans people are
i don't have a bluesky never use socials anyway beside twitch and youtube
link is pretty cool, he kills bugs and doesn’t afraid of anything
isnt there that big thing that adds an extra analog
yeah without CPP idk what else there would be
Thought you said "nice dick" KEKW
only 3ds game i care about is dragon quest 8
only 3ds game i care about is all of them
i really liked spirit tracks, i haven't played it in ages though
only zelda i haven't beat is zelda 2
Who doesn't love running across a field on all fours and completely nude?
@blacktiger51 Zelda II is scuffed,but enjoyable
youtube already has my ID anyway though
if that id thing come to Canada vpn time
i heard that only if you have a shit vpn
i rather pay then give youtube my id
Pretty sure I gave youtube my ID to get a student discount on premium
I forgot to follow you last time
I need to go now see you Phantom
WOOO! Time to stick your sword in GANON'S ASS TIME
Gee, I wonder what GANON'S up to anyways
hold up, lemme unfollow and follow again then
Twitch be glitching like usual.  Was wondering why it hadn't started yet and realized after the ads it paused the stream.  Pass goats and everything already haha.
On mobile today so it always comes with weird even more glitches
Are any goats eligible for eating today?
Haha that's good.  I make the joke since there is always the one goat that goes off to wonderland and beyond so I make the joke "guess we're eating that one"
Or the last time where the 6 shadow birds almost killed you blocking the way to zelda
Hey we didn't get cockblocked by them this time!
Oh them I see them do Sonic ones all the time
They got a $500 Morrigan statue
hey Phantom can you read the following backwards? "was it a car or a cat I saw" Cheer100
if you take out the spaces it matches
battle network shuffler wil def bring the viewers in... just have to change your name to risch KEKW
i dont watch bingo, do people find that appealing?
Time to learn every zelda game over for a gba shuffler
I have seen a lttp and minish shuffled before.  Was neat.
I think a mario advance shuffler could be interesting. Advance 1-4
Crossworlds for alltp is pretty well solved right?
Well...have like 6 windows up.  Have a timer up to spin a wheel to swap to the next one?  It's a low tech solution I've seen before.
Ah true...the paper mario one was pretty well
how did you remove the seed once you finished one?
At that point with a game that is less known having it limited to 2 might be better.  So you just swap to the other window
I mean...I didn't watch it on YouTube since I watched it live 😅🤣
At that point splice it and make a supercut
I've heard more and more people are just leaving YouTube.  At the mercy of an algorithm with zero transparency has killed multiple channels over the years
Yeah...a couple I watch started on YouTube and transitioned to twitch doing the games live with viewers watching then just uploading the vods because YouTube one day just went "nope"
Huh neat.  I'll have to check if I've watch that one.  I found you from the mario randos from watching another creator.
So. I finally heard they're sending me a replacement and it should arrive Monday night
ooh skies of arcadia legends RA set is out
... they sent *an entire new frame*
And they said I don't need to send the old one back
So like. I'm still a little PJSalt y at how long it took and the fact I've been without a working desk for an extra week
(I'm also on call next week so that'll be extra fun)
Like. I called Sunday and they said they would need to replacement. It took until last night for it to ship because of the one-email-a-day and asking for silly things like the video and then the address they already had and then a whole extra day just to tell the warehouse to ship it. Etc
But like... I basically got an extra 2 legged desk out of the ordeal
RIP that sucked for no reason
That was worse than the desk company
So basically i could just order a butcher block or something, and have a normal 2 legged sit stand desk, or use the broken leg and just have a non-adjustable L desk
I guess this is all assuming the new legs actually work LUL
Yeah the horse back fights in this game always have me a bit monkaS on spur management and dealing with extra enemies
Would you like me to sue the game?
I wouldn't trust a wario amiibo either
Could you just PB without someone subscribing?
I appreciate you at least make it valuable then
I don't have any submarine sandwiches :(
And I would probably eat one if I did
Ok that was an awkward time for an ad
I had no idea what happened with the trick LUL
Like you were going down into the lake and then ad
If Twitch was trying to convince someone to subscribe that might have worked
Unfortunately I am broke. I just spent the rest of my future income on Nier Automata because it was on sale
Look $13 and apparently the best sale they've ever had
Ehh. If I don't play it for 2 whole hours I can refund it
I tried that peak game but it kept crashing and glitching so I refunded that :(
It looked interesting. But the hour I tried it was just frustrating and I didn't feel like spending $7 on a game that I'd only enjoy with friends knowing the chances they played it again were between negative and zero
Especially when it basically didn't work for more than 10 minutes at a time
Yeah. Like I think I bought R.E.P.O but that one is much easier to find a group for and also didn't crash any time I played it
You might still be able to tbh
Like the official policy is 2 weeks
But I've heard of like a month or two
Unfortunately that same situation is me with Baulders Gate 3
Paid like $60, friends played by themselves, haven't played it and since it's gone on sale for like $40
I could be convinced to play
I don't like a lot of multiplayer games for that too
Like one I've had is Dungeon Defenders. It's one those you don't need multiple people but solo gets more and more difficult
Over the Hedge. VoteNay  Over the Ledge VoteYea
But yeah we'll see how I feel about Nier
I got reminded of it from Clair Obscur. I don't usually care for those gameplay styles but the story seems really good
game giving you trouble since i left?
And for $13 I figured I could give it a shot and see if I could get into it
Game has stabbed him the back, twisted the knife, stabbed him in the front, and then asked "why you mad bro" while poking his eye
you are not having a good time...started out kickin but you're too far in i'm guessing?
nobody questions why the rock floats and disintegrates along with a human turning into a wolf and doing the same
you are capable...you're awesome ass hell
That run needed to be put down
i gotta say...as much as i love lake hylia...those shadow beasts fucking suck
if you end up having to start again...take a quick breather
i gotta close my eyes for a bit so im gonna change to my phone and lurk
Time for those goats and that bo
Okay I gotta do what I said i was gonna do lol
You know what the world needs more of?
Zelda games with dungeons that have dungeon items and maybe not strictly linear but semi-linear progression YEP
They're gonna switch 2 using dungeons again
Take a break... clear the mind
I said A rando lolz not tp
Can also just do vanilla plays
And if you're not even streaming, why are you odd?
Did you guys hear about the fire in Canada being started by a flying fish?
I would have watched Clair Obscure: Expedition 34
I get ya... but maybe some days we should just take time out of the stats and just stream something you enjoy playing
The only way that would actually make sense is if he set up a second channel
I have a headache and just got out the shower a bit ago
I don't understand the vods thing...idk how to stop them from expiring
I'm good just got back from the beach
You have to download them or export them to another platform
Only 7 days for me :/
It's 7 standard, 14 for affiliates, 60 for partners, or Twitch Turbo/Prime users
I was recommended from someone idr to upload them on YouTube
Thank you Sam lolz I like the play on your name
Haha yeah me too I thought that one up a while ago and I've been using it ever since
I just like the name Ann
Makes sense tbh...I get a lot of like...art people showing up
I was gonna ask about MM lolz
I haven't gotten a chance to understand how to do it...I wanna do like the OoT MM randomizers
I watched someone do like...tp ww rando and was just like WOW
It just seemed unreal...like a "you can do that?"
But also have fun evo17Hiyo evo17Heart
You don't want me to go?
I will say for me. It's usually less of the game/category and more just trying to gauge how sus chat is being that day LUL
Like I don't really care for PM
"Boy you sure are thick"....midna why
Judging my the chain freaking out...probably
I can stay for a bit longer
Boy, you sure are thick lol
I am infact doing well. making dinner
That's just funny that Midna says that
@samshine12 I'm not sure if shes talking about the fact that youre trying to skip it lol
I'm too poor for sub atm lolz
Sam I'm always gonna be there lol
But uh...yeah so much stuff is being handled in the house that my money is just getting drained
No...I'm on SSI. Epileptic so I cant work or drive...and i miss working :(
I wish i was at least a different category rather than the tonic clonic one. But I just got approved this year so its been a few months
Awwww that must be so hard to deal with
I have the one where I lose consciousness and convulse
I had a traumatic brain injury at a young age
I mean it doesnt help i broke my leg at the start of 2025 either xD
That sounds awful I'm so sorry
@samshine12 What happened? evo17Wut if youre okay with me asking
Only 1 month left...then "here i go again on my oooown"
My dad hurt me real badly
Omg i wish I could hug you evo17Wut
I'm still doing physical therapy 20 years later
DK64R has their first season 4 qualifiers right now... the race time as 44 people and every single one is streaming
@samshine12 I didn't know they do pt for brain injuries...but at least youre getting help
I thought they stopped the charity stream?
I think it was on purpose
its hard enough just to get 6 people for pape
@samshine12 He's a bully if on purpose...but if an accident then I hope he apologized lots
I don't think I can do pape rando...the music is too relaxing
plus all the top racers dropped it like jcog, M4, paperario, ect.
He went to jail but he did apologize
@samshine12 Well...bad but at least he apologized
I'm gonna be honest...I really miss my dad. And regret being mad for so long
Even though I haven't seen him for 20 years
Overtime shift is now done and today was supposed to be my day off
i get asked why I dont race anymore, its cause people dont know how to make good race settings anymore
have you ever played majoras mask
Thank you for sharing about your epilepsy Anni
did minish races ever take off?
Thank you for telling me about your injury Sammy
Majoras Mask is a great game
Dude MM and TP are top tier
is 15k points enough to ask you to do like hug% in majora or should i keep saving points. i don't even care if its a rando or whatever i just thought it would be really funny for someone to do hug%
Anni would you like to be friends?
hug% requires 2 dungeon clears if vanilla
That would be nice sam! Sure
I have never beaten skyward sword bc black avocado is always in my nightmares from the uncensored commercials on tv.
yeah i don't like time mechanics either
I think it would be nice too
i love the idea of it like in shenmue
playing on 3DS makes it easier LUL
only if you patch the 3ds version
because they ruined ice arrows and the deku bounce momentum
and the boss fight for the worms
every time the worm goes in the ground the hp resets. but the 3ds does have that time book and the guide rocks
there are still some things that are ambiguous on 3ds that you can get stuck on
I'm looking for advice atm Phan and community
i went back to wind waker the other day and i was freaking lost
I haven't been able to stream because appointments. I'm free Tuesday but also not. Is it a good idea to stream on a grieving day?
Tuesday is the day my dad passed
I'm just unsure is the most part
It's been a year but its like 2 days before my grandma's birthday
tomorrow marks 8 years since my grandmother passed
if you're asking if its "correct" i don't think ur dad would want you to mope for his sake but if you're too emotional to stream it makes sense not to
@Axl_SR I'm sorry...even though its been so long
@TomaThePolliwog I guess I'll start and then see how I end up...doing
my nana has been gone since 2015 and i don't really think about her death day. but i do think about her on her birthday or on holidays so
Makes sense yeah...I wish i could visit his grave but that's an 8 hr drive
yeah thats a tough place to be.
Yeah..tried to make things better but it was too late
you might wish you had more empathy even though you were put through hell
It's harder to deal with death when youre older :/
:( have a nice night/day heh
i had to go through the like. realization that my parents are just people and trying not to blame them too hard for things ive been through
We all make mistake even parents do
I don't think I'll ever forgive my grandpa for..."harassing" me though
its hard for me to relate to my family. my nana was the only one who really ever inquired about what i was interested in. but now I'm like. is my role to ask instead of expecting to be asked? but sometimes you talk and its just like. they have no interest in forming a frame of reference
I never thought of life like that...let alone family
i think my nana's outwardness came from a deep pain of being ignored
I should talk to my grandma more...shes the one I'm always afraid of losing
yeah, if you can. what i would do is talk and record her but just don't tell her. ask her about stories
you might be the only one who ever has their voice
I don't think I can record her from another state lolz
i've had this message in my chatbox for like 4h lol
If something for october...play a spooky scary game
i love twitch not sending messages
what if you shuffle a spooky hat
or could do an archipelago shuffler if i ever get around to making that work
or would have to use process based shuffler
could play through games you've never played on shuffler Kappa
wind waker but the shuffle is the boat gets teleported to a random spot
the devs knew what they were doing in this game
process based def open up a bit more options but is also prob more annoying to use
@TomaThePolliwog Exactly they barrier locked the barriers.
can't imagine obs playing nice with that either
i meant spending so long on midna's facial animations but ok
it struggles with a few things like dolphin having a different window for games
@TomaThePolliwog even though there are golden wall skips hardly anyone ever does zach skip on castle climb.
you could always have some kind of obs program to swap filters, start all the games and then when the process swaps just swap the crop in obs idk
i'm also thinking on an AP perspective tbh
EponaHonse the 12 year old of this world.
yeah ive recently run into a scenario where i needed sql notify but its easier to just write a wrapper
Remember to pay that skeleton for tuition
yea it would def require some setup work that's for sure
just gonna support more that way
i think the wrapper would be sufficient
so long the wrapper has access to what it needs
i've done my part of very dubious hack im sure that would be reasonable
i've overriden win32 method pointers once KEKW
it was to handle third party code starting thread that would just... die randomly with the entire process
so i did a hack to inject an exception capture for threads
work makes you do stupid stuff sometimes KEKW
never thought id ever say this but BopBop just has replaced Burgy and McDZombieHamburglar as my fave emote.
sometimes its just that kinda day
Yes so u r doing it after all would have been better if u replied though. GL on this today
The dark souls run with the DDR pad is one of the best possible runs ever.
Which goat are we gonna eat today
Oh we don't get to eat any today darn
Ooh we got it first try LuvSign
2nd try Hugo was not a referee tis day
Sub 3?  But you still have 17 goats to go then
Ngl that sounds like a semi balanced breakfast
It's collective eating.  So it doesn't have to be but it usually is.
I’m so upsetti spaghetti I missed the race invite
forest bit took me a while to figure out tbh
i do the whole full set up tho, the lanbtern lioght, the flip the turn, and i STILL fuck up the timing of getting the sword horizontal
I’m so hype you’re finally doing any%
Yo phanto274GL on the race i been here lurking
i walk in on "good luck to only me"
before i go ahead and pass out
i uh...went to the salon with my MIL...i got convinced into doing my nails
but hey my ankle stopped being stiff so...W. like you're gonna get a W here
good luck I’m going to go stream for a bit before work
No way my name is also Phantom5800
safe to say i did not wake up for this
i finished an all masks run at 4:30am KEKW
no because i missed TCS at the end of the run :(
I'm trying to find a speedgame to run
The thing is, I was a Undertale/deltarune speedrunnner until I was cyberbullied & banned for accidently calling people by the wrong pronouns a few times
Which i still think is messed up
wreaked a bit of havoc in botwsr
Oh wait i recognize that name too lol
Ok but did you atleast floor it?
So hopefully the boost is all charged up then
oh yeah babey we're so Paper Mario rn
So does that mean checks you need will never be in 1, 2 etc etc?
Ohh neat, I gotta try these settings then
its 23:43 here. gonna be a while
Yoooo how goes the Rando? majora66Love
Paper Mario 64 is an all time classic for me.
i lurked for the TP race how did it go??
they should add the option to remove all saves
yeah i think the wr is a 2:40 ish or smth?
for a first run thats great
youre quicker then 6 billion ppl
that was a little worth it
Howdy Phantom hope you’re having a good one! how did the race go? missed the end
Alright, I haven’t done a  s5 seed yet, how are they feeling so far?
I’m excited to try the dungeon shuffle, I haven’t got around to trying it yet
Jr try harder, you’re just getting walked over phanto274Fine
can’t go wrong with more Pape
also I saw your footage was used in that GaMetal video, Mirby, congrats that’s hype!
i have done footage for so so many gametal videos lol
literally a moment of "do you have any idea how little that narrows it down" mirbysLUL
what's next, a rock on mt rugged?
lmfao I think it was the newer Gangplank galleon one
ah yeah lol. yeah i did the DKC GBC footage there
I went down a rabbit hole after seeing the composer for Pokemon Colosseum and XD play with someone who did a medley and then boom it was VGM remixes and saw you mentioned
that’s pretty cool to be credited there
I would have forgot it the first time I did it so I’m betting I still will
I haven’t done coin block shuffle and I’m not looking forward to relearning my desert routing
Honestly nothin like a good ol paper mario stream to calm the nerves
I'm doing meh, something really bad happened before the race
It's fine, it's just one of those temporary bad moments that will pass and then everything will be fine
Question, in a paper mario randomizer, absolutely everything is randomized? Like even the load zones are randomized for example
oh right I forgot standalone are off, that makes 4 not completely loaded now
"Mario HATES Star Pieces." Absolutely loathes those things."
yeah that’s right it was so front loaded you pretty much should go there immediately if you could
was lurking since you trashed the cloud machine
Oh woah, i didn't even notice you were playing as waluigi
I’m just glad your map tracker has the visual, I can learn the coin blocks on the fly at least
Okay I return now. How did everything go?
are we going to be lucky and have a s5 preset? monadoCope
I still can't believe the item spawning behind Mario was always a thing..
Are there randomizers for the mario and luigi rpg games?
Cause that would be fun to see
The Superstar Saga one is okay but it’s mostly AP only
I didn't even knew paper mario could get such high numbers
@Amishman19 i've played SS in AP before, quite enjoy it
honestly i just wish it was a harder game in rando PrideLaugh
Oh look, a mush badge, destroy every fight
i'm actually playing an archi tonight doing some smz3 TPFufun
Speaking of console, you're playing this in a real n64 right?
i'm good at sm and terrible at lttp lol
Yeah isn't this game like hard to emulate 100% or something?
I know LttP tricks, but I'm not familiar with the glitches. Outside of early Dark World.
Nintendo can’t even emulate it correctly
LttP was my introduction to Zelda, so I've got a huge soft spot for it
i tried to run lttp once
Minish cap is the one with toon link right?
so i gave up when I wasn't immediately a wr runner
Then it's the best game ever made
tf were they smoking with that dude
I'unno why but smiting enemies with lightning is always fun to me
I’ve tried to play MM so many times and could never get into it
MM has few dungeons but they're all well designed
the mm dungeons are good beside stt
ww dungeons aren't very good yeah
side note, last night our neighbor gave us pizza with mushrooms, pineapple and pepperoni. That shit was ASS.
@buff00n the mushrooms ruin it smh
i always get lost in stt always miss a chest or something
earth temple is fine but fuck wind temple
I'd like MM dungeons more if I wasn't hunting for stray fairies
The game is fun until the triforce piece hunt imo
@buff00n i mean that's not REQUIRED but like... yeah why wouldn't you
i refuse to do a ww rando cuz of wind temple
just junk all of wind temple KEKW
What would be the BLJ equivalent of mario 64 in paper mario?
hell i don't even want to do totg
If I knew WW well enough I think I'd like rando but its been a few years since I played
@RobinWings_ there's a very nice map tracker you can use if you wanna get back into it
I REALLY wanna do a Skyward Sword rando but setting that up is beyond me
I'unno who decided that the MM spin attack upgrade applies to the 360 shortcut, but I hope that people got a raise
Like, a trick that allows you to move really fast or even glitch through the collision or something like that
@wolfyhii Oooo something to look into for sure
didn't play TotK cuz I figured I wouldn't care for it since I was ehh on BotW
sub 1:30 go mode is incredible to me
@buff00n it's basically just slightly better botw with a way better story imo
I'd have liked BotW more if weapons didn't break so easily, but I'm told the game wouldn't make sure w/o breakable weapons.
@wolfyhii saw Phantom play it, and knew it wasn't gonna grab me
legit, everything I disliked about BotW, a friend told me he LOVED all those things
@buff00n that was one of the things that made me struggle to get into it
the Thunder Temple is not well designed imo, very confusing
I did all of the Divine Beasts, then just never booted up the game ever again
yeahh that dungeon was bad, even the lead up to it kinda sucked
I honestly thought that one was the best
the stamina being so limited early feels so bad with the world being so big too
But that's not saying much lol
also, cannot fathom that the DLC to make power up the Master Sword, doesn't fix it from breaking. Wot's the bloody point.
They're all just designed the same way as the divine beasts
The Goron dungeon was pretty sick from what I remember, it being in the depths and whatnot
doesn't help that Link goes NOWHERE when running. It doesn't feel much faster than his jog, imo
I get the intention of Fuse
I'm less into games that expect me to make my own fun / experiences. I want that shit already made for me to enjoy.
It was mainly to address people's complaints with the weapon durability
I still havent updated my game since they patched duping LUL
Hey i'm not saying i was the biggest fan either LUL
I heard they were super hard pressed to patch every glitch that was discovered
also, MAYBE if the weapons from the dead champions didn't break, those would be worth something. But no. "If you gather the material, I can make you another" NO THANKS
so, it's better to run BotW on Switch 1?
That’s crazy, every other game gets faster and this slows down
oh we're getting into dogshit territory if close call is needed
is that generally how this plays out with s5 settings
yeah all the blitz ones it’s not just a walk
all 7 chapters just guaranteed danger and the end game was trivial
@Amishman19 the bit i played in the early builds, i def agree
watt really feels like a masterpiece of a partner in so many ways
it's for sure more interesting like this, can probably just suck in a race setting sometimes lol
There is the odd race it’s bad but I don’t find it happens too too often
how much defense does bowser get from shielding himself?
it’s 4/5 on English/JP hallway right?
GG fam. just got here lol
I think you’re the best blitz player on the world so you’re probably pretty safe lmao
nah at my desk setting up now
gonna root against Phantom in their own chat? smdh
listen Lopez always gets gl from me
how fast y'all setup cannon jumps now is mindboggling
am I right this is GIGAFRIENDS music or is this end credits
wait this is Minish then isn’t it
No it can’t be which is it
phanto274Lurk lurky struggling to stay awake hospital getting worse   i give u power to win
Darn missed the whole thing it seems the card show and work job went well.
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO WIN BIG, CHAT
KEKW as soon as i wanted to gamba for first time ever it closed up.
ty I don’t need them but I can’t resist a free win KEKW
I mean you got this Phantom! phanto274S
We are all the coughing baby to Lopez’s hydrogen bomb
oh so u sub 4ed awsm!
Forgot to say here GLHF dont die or crash
I can hear the Mario Kart being setup now
Hello, Paper Mario. This is Goomba King, and I write this letter painstakingly to inform you that I will be pressing charges against you for your misdemeanors. I will need to be paid damages for the destruction of my house, the hospital bills for my flavored goombas (Eldstar bless their souls), the hours that went into scraping me off of the background, and the nut you dislodged from my tree. Don't think you'll be spinning your way out of this one, I'll see you in court.
omg I don’t think I’ve seen that bot announcement before lmao
i feel like paper mario is the kind of game that is like doom. but it doesn't have the cult following to get ported to everything
just send parakarry out for delivery to trade the mushroom
Dang went to taste test my Tortellini dinner and boom burned out tonguies
Solid start from both prologue went well
finally we can trade that mushroom. carry this letter across the internet parakarry thanks
Nobody accidentally talked to Buzzar, race is dead
fair point, the later the funnier too
Lopez was out here playing rando the whole time
Don't worry someone is going to paste a link soon
i died here twice during a rando i played cause the chain chomps were lethal
1 hr party and no forfeits niceys
damn those support beams aren't connected smh Sadge
legend says the boo mansion now has two more boo butlers... toadsworth and diddy kong
Man am I sweating on this pred now
that 0.5 seconds makes all the difference in bake time
how is it, without fail, every pape64 stream i see from anyone i catch chapter 5
2 hr slamboree and strong ToetoToe
this has consistently happened since jcog was running RAC
...as i don't run this game i didn't realize that
it's time for FUCK! THIS! GAMESHOW!
Livesplit didn't automatically fuck you over 👏
Hi, quick question (so it's fast). Are you using the NOS in this race?
phantom is super far behind huh
Probably because he hasn't used the NOS
back on your Kart bullshit M4? 😏
Oh goodness and boy both my stream stutters and stall lags missed my fave huff n puff
bad times all around were had 😔
castle library one scripted for the final fights already, I assume?
me fighting my mint bush tomorrow like
3 hrs of no quit greatness
Bow to our King of chilly greatness. Lets all Ice out.
you can forget everything else. forget boo feet for the love of everything unholy
Pape dailies can be forgotten alongside boo feet
be gay do crime as they say
everyone gets a chance to support their local library, how wholesome fatpidCOMNFY
suggestion: jump on him until he dies
it's only the 5th entry for some reason
bad choices were made all around today
@buff00n It's fun for a small multiplayer game
Good news, ad break skipped peach fight
still eating, will be a minute
i didnt know wha half the setting were soooo
surely you can just beat it without cheating NODDERS
very interested in watching this glitch logic
omg is this like...rando but without the perks?
this is very very evil i love it
have i made a softlocked  seed?
just checking cause i have spoiler   is the spheres the "logic"
glitch logic is everything on right
always assuming everything is done simultaneously within a single sphere
this is looking like a very cursed seed
imagine if ive made a impossible seed
i gave u spinner cause i like spinner
do scents count as an item?
am i allowed to give hint too
what if you talk to the spirit in faron? doesn't it count as a cutscene?
does this have fast spinner enabled
@TheMasterZelda I think i missed that
can't wait for the nuts duping to epona clip into forest temple
i gave spinner cause me like spinner
Phantom of phantom. I think those Twilight Beasts want to attack tou
the things didn't appear when you were on the spinner
I may have done that backwards
Been a while since I've watched that season
how are we all doing today? :)
for refrence jewel i know nothing and  pressed buttons  and read tiny descriptions
makes it all more fun when you don't know what's going on lol
that explosion is what happening inside phantoms head doing this seed :P
was on the phone with my sister lol
Okay but ngl if I saw a dog posting on Discord I'd back away slowly hoping it didn't notice me
I don't want to be replaced by a dog
so this gonna be like a 8 hour rando
that is cutest fucking dog EVER
so uh i was dm'd and uh gl
well this is really gonna cut into your time...
i'm pretty sure spinner from start is what makes this so weird
autosaving... man wouldn't that be wonderful...?
yea at least it wasn't lanayru twilight
yeah if that had happened like 2 hours in that would have sucked...
not that it doesn't suck now but it would have really sucked...
and who knows what'll be behind rang
OK urrm I have made another seed JUST incase u wana swap and i think ive chosen better
i am extremely tired lol but gotta stay up
That's like an Okami level fight trigger skip LUL
don't go into malo mart and just head straight for death mountain lol
I'm good about to have dinner
whatcha makin for the din din?
Why do you have to stay up Anni?
i had 2 red bulls and coffee and it's not time to sleep yet
technically 2 because i had one at like 1 am
Greek Salad and Steak is dinner tonight
For some reason it couldn't let me chat and said that i needed to verify my phone number
i gotta refill my meds hold on
Ok now I've definitely broke twitch, it's letting me see a stream of someone that banned me from their streams, it even let's me type and spend points, wth twitch fix your platform
<3 u can do it phantommm sorry the seed is jank :P
i've seen some early version crash
Honestly, i dig the purple hearts, they look cooler than the overrated red hearts
Ngl that scared me a bit
probably from not doing king bulb and also not going deeper into uh...DM
cause it been almost a hour can i give u sphere 0 hint
post goron mine is for the owl mask
post king bulb because he mentions wanting to be a hero too without fighting
tbh i can't figure out the sphere 0 hint lmao
def some glitched logic shenanigan going on
Me when i touch the rupee of instant freezing
Thanks for making me feel welcome
you're always welcome here my friend!
you can just cuccoo jump no?
phantom cause malo was crashing do u want me to check if malo is required
malon has it you have to go to lon lon ranch to get the dom rod
can you run over shadow beasts with epona?
wait what's the requirement for warping
is there a way out of Eldin as wolf?
this might be a sign to pack it up and roll a new seed lmao
no we just gotta keep pushing lol
im kinda surprised it softlock you even in rando
wait what about the other bug location?
@Phantom5800 i sent u a glitchless one if u wnat
rain said epona looks like a zombie
wait 50 rupees head to bomb dude?
eeee made u not glitched one
apple dm this seed to me lolz i wanna try
and i think you're softlocked of doing it now?
i can hint to what you are required to do for sphere 0
all of sphere 0 checks are locked behind the same thing
i genuinely don't even know how to do said thing
maybe try faron with epona since you cleared eldin?
you may not be locked out of it but idk if it needs map glitch or something else
can you get to lake hylia from the bridge?
wait does the Ordon loading zone still exist?
when do we call it quit ;-;
shuffled entrance: "Castle Town North Inside Barrier -> Forest Temple Entrance",
are you able to even jump that gate?
r u sure u dont wana just swap and save ur sanity?
atleast the other seed is glitchless
hopefully the other seed is beatble
@AppleQueenUwU I CANNOT SWEEP, I CANNOT DWEAM TONIIIIIGHT
if it was at least listed....
@AppleQueenUwU I Miss You - Blink 183
also fyi the dominion rod wasn't ever required
i think i turne twilight off on 2nd
but it ruins the game :/
whats the things about wolf being able to do it without midna charge
my only thought was can u get the bugs without wolf
is it only with wolf bite attack that it works?
@TheMasterZelda you mean during MDH or the fact it was only 1?
<3 thank u again btw phantom
i'm hungry now so imma brb
just throwing the only thing i know lol
hehhee put a bounty out for the seed? or ask devs
it may also just be a glitched seed because of some specific settings combination
phantomm i dont understand anything on th paper mario one
hello i'm playing Superstar Saga in an archi and im already locked out of checks phanto274Smile
i could but i'd rather someone else do it megara11Durp
its way too hot here i can't
maybe tp rando is just bad Kappa
i always just use dolphin so idk
so what did i miss so far?
U HAVE FAST SPINNER THIS TIME
i think the random starting is funny
WE CAN PLAY THE GAME THIS TEIMEE
can it be like in oot and the BK specifically is what is locked behind dungeons?
I see things are going swimmingly
hehehe better than last seed still
that is some interesting epona coloring
it's why i never say "h!" lol
is a damage multiplier on or something
image if you only had zora armor...
I thought you were at full which is why I was like ?! I know ice does normally what, a heart, half a heard in other games
the multiplier is TEN for zora armor???
this seed just got a lot more cursed
ur reaction shows tha not good?
there is a museum dedicated to the 90s. one of main attraction is the N64
Link looks weird with lighter blonde hair here
the 2 chests on top of the pillars must be my most hated checks in the game
wondering how its not getting more snow
gonna make a watermelon mint mocktail and churro cookies
we have a massive mint plant we've done nothing with so far
also i did an oopsy, meant less
or any snow at all really
man this heat is killing my brain
but sometimes the chicken just walk off
just placed an order for a buncha chicken bones for an art project and I am wiggling excitedly
each time u freeze me giggle
Unfortunately they need to be properly degreased
and that takes 2 months worth of cleaning or more (natural cleaning) otherwise
I've processed bones I've found before, it takes a lot of soaking and gently cleaning them with dawn and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide
If you *do* wanna store up a buncha bones for later tho after they've gotten a simple wash, I will take a care package if you're just gonna toss em
Wishbones especially go for a lot in bone trader circles
The only chicken I really eat is breastmeat and my mom's vegan so I cannot justify getting a whole one for just the bones and breast meat
you can kill the old man now
2 minutes for that beautiful disaster
it's nice there's hints, is that recent?
I don't remember them from before
apparently I just never get here early enough to see them then
gotta support the church funded terrorism fund
Outta all the castle towns, this is definitely my fave
i prefer minish cap castle town
it feels the most flavorful like yeah there'd totally be a minigame to collect light
@FatPidgeyBirb this one feels like a proper castle town, then oot's
Minish Cap is pretty good, but this has the sauce
lamp oil, rope? bombs? you want it? it's YOURS, my friend, as long as you have enough rupees
I'd say this is my least favorite grotto, but like half of em are my least favorite LUL
there are a lot that randomly suck
may as well have been vanilla
like that's imitation vanilla it's not even french
thank goodness for that big wallet to hold that orange rupee
not required, but often is helpful
i kind of wanna attempt a "dungeon rewards anywhere" type of seed...but i wanna know how annoying is it
it becomes mostly a treasure hunt
personally not a big fan of these
i like having a set goal
but sometimes I like fishing up a buncha treasure casually on the Great Sea, I can see the appeal
i love how this seed is like 2 items from go mode but also we need all sky characters lol
now I'm curious about what you were gonna try lmao.
i shall one day create a dungeon reward anywhere seed for test. hopefully i can not be as agitated lol
yea i know there's cuckoo in the cave but genuinely didn't know it actually unlocked them outside too
oh my ad had orange chicken at the end...
i just know it said now you can go to faron woods or something like that
think apple fell asleep...which is what i do too lol
i always just cross the alcove out along with springwater rush because they piss me off so much
the seller of the beginner violin I was peeking at just sent me an offer for $30 off, and I'm just glaring at it with desire
if you're not on a budget then go for it
but my hands crave a new hobby
I could open up some cheap commissions for it I guess
but I'd need to do it soon, I got 4 days
It's a pretty nice starter instrument, they go for like $500 new
Yeah it was. Wonder if that's a bug with that rupee specifically.
watc the bommerrang be springwater rush
I made a nametag at work that'll probably get me fired
bombs? ?? ? not useful??? ZELDA BLASPHEMY
you got iron boots quto um qoute
its just you need zero rupiees to use it
i vaguely remember it not working to activate anything weight related, including goron stuff
i COULD be wrong however, this is second hand knowledge
all you're missing is master sword right?
wait don't we know where boomerang is
N O D U N G E O N R E Q U I R E D
wait, doesn't that mean its likely to be the boomerang?
final sky characters check is in eldin no?
or unless when you get the final one it just give the "true" reward
also this fire looks mega hot monkaGIGA
how nice of that ice trap to put out the fire on you
I'm in upper intermediate french now
they had english to ask the questions before!!! MY METAPHORICAL CRUTCHES
that's like asking if a songbird is an instrument
malo mart is perfectly functional YEP
not at all a nuke YEP
I did a wizzrobe msu seed after
A bunch of different siivagunner tracks LUL
Wizzrobe makes these every few months and finds the best bangers
R E Q U I R E D
oh yea you do need bow for that... unless the boss is randomized
Yes woot ur still on just had a major meltdown fight with my mom and all steamed out.
The fact that you have double claw and no sword
got it like 30m in max lol
the fact that "no dungeon required" but rolled "sky characters (required)" is so funny
oh boy double the amount of checks required
you can get your bow (unrequired)
swipelefted on the Bow LUL KEKW
wait you have bow now, lakebed goes much further
i wonder why this one specifically Kappa
all fun and game until AP ichimaiaAwk
there's like hundred of digging spots KEKW
but hey you have a sky character
over 2 hrs in and no sword
@morpheus080 How do u go about tp randos dungeons first or spear zeroes?
does the game hate you or is this normal
there's... 4? sword in the pool
@stavros12c34anenoglou i have no idea stavros, i barely play MM rando as it is
never sure if butter sword is
@morpheus080 the game must the earlier seed he was transform and sword locked NotLikeThis
this game keeps on getting weirder ichimaiaAwk
this room is such a meme
temple of time behind mirror ichimaiaAwk
N O D U N G E O N R E Q U I R E D
uh i though you needed bombs for these
idk all speedruns use bombs for them so i just though it didn't work
well you used to kill the other ones
there's uh... the boss key ichimaiaAwk
fast spinner is silly i love it
no dungeon required slowly turning into all dungeons required
i love the lack of damage feedback
swift fight i must say good going
D: You just killed those twilight beasts
we know lakebed entrance is foolish
time to check eldin for gale boomerang? shiruClown
if you had a sword shiruHAH
one was hinted in a dungeon
you could use the icetrap to drain money faster
youtube AI has kicked off, they cant even pin comments
ChatGpt the death of us all
man I love the magic armor. too bad we never see it
I know how you can lose all your money
ill take your bits if you dont want them
Couldn't you donate them to malo mart?
Hey Phantom, you in the market for any kinda vtuber stuff Kappa
Streamer those enemies are attacking you
this is a good pee break
I wish I could get 10 dollars each time I attacked someone
As long as you attack the right target and attack them successfully
link just nervously looking at the rats with his hand on the sword is kinda funny
Yeah but that involves giving money to the church
I urge you not to do that
Giving 500 to a church sounds terrible
Just because it's a tax deductible expense doesn't mean it's not a waste of 500
ill take ur 500 but u can't write it off
I could do for a solid 500 rn
If I had 500, I'd definitely order some pizza
no but i have 25 bits themas213Grelda
I would but car name change and number incoming
giant emotes are funny i agree
this seed hints as gaslighting us
may have been that specific bow was not required then
I know WWR likes to only put one bottle in logic
but you need bow to beat temple of time
i love pick a path YEP
Sorry but that's a kind of perfect number
Not sure I can change that
1700 just doesn't have the same ring
the fact this seed is still less cursed than the other one
trick only ever possibly relevant in rando with random spawn location
the reminds me of castle vania 64 dracula fight LuL
drop 10 enemy on the player
doesn't these chests require light sword in logic to avoid softlocks?
you're brave doing these checks with zora armor on still 😏
its looking more and more that its a sword upgrade ngl
since one of the dungeon is locked behind boomerang
but we have like 4 dungeon entrances left
and we know hyrule castle can't be gm or forest right?
true could be worth a try
fun fact mini freezers destroy bombs
Yo, caught a randomizer. Just dropping in to say hello. phanto274Wave
I'm doing well. How about yourself?
i will never understand damage values in this game
if its city this is over
So you fall into a void to beat up King Bulblin
Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind
The airbenders foretold how to defeat KB a long time ago
I just now realized you only had the wooden sword
i love how you beat up KB just to get into hyrule castle to beat up KB again
I was like I do NOT remember these enemies being this difficult
But maybe I've watched too many speedruns where they only do quick spins and stuff
nah wooden sword truly is just that bad
Then why did you slice back?
this isn't in logic anyway right?
wait maybe the sky character reward is the key
legit no sword is more fun than wooden sword
crazy your still on usually with work I miss you
Sounds like a rando redemption well spent!
o/. gl on 3d paper luigi
i wasn't watching when you passed here earlier
turns out eldin sky character isn't specific enough
good luck with the rest YEP
oh it is kinda late for you huh
I remember the hint for it, at least
its def awkward for the more casual audience
for it to be required, where would be the last sword upgrade
unless palace of shadow has the key
oh that would explain one of the required thing
last sword upgrade could be behind temple of time entrance
pls not temple of time ichimaiaAwk
a goron, they live here didn'tcha know
wait... i think its guaranteed to be temple of time
temple of time has to be vanilla or here
temple of time can't be on sky cannon
i always thought the very first room of temple of time looked like a crying clown
i tend to see weird things in zelda maps for some reason
like the Desert Colossus in oot looks like a deflating balloon
fun fact as a kid i though this poe was missable KEKW
i never saw the small statue
i though you HAD to smash the gate
i think i thought the same thing tbh
dom rod never loses power if you go back to ToT
on my tiny ass CRT you literally couldn't see them
i also never knew how to get this chest in here until i was like 19
i did figure out this one
the one thing i didn't figure out was the south hyrule fountain chest
that chest HAUNTED ME as a kid
i could just never find the hookshot target
tbf that target is so awkward
like why is it so finicky
smh Agatha doesn't want a cute puppy girl
that's what she says if you talk to her as a wolf
yeah she says "hi puppy, i don't speak puppy"
the one npc not scared of you KEKW
hey lil puppy, hey lil puppy. I wish you were a bug so i could put you in my bug museum
and its the fancy lil girl KEKW
she ain't a dog person but she may be a dog person you know what i'm sayin
@TheMasterZelda hey mr bird nest head also says "I'm not afraid of you, my sister is way scarier"
coro killed the first seed ichimaiaAwk
coro had both sphere 0 checks ichimaiaAwk
oh you do have the spinner
for some reason i thought ad runners use the spinner to kill all those spiders
i don't think any category kill those spiders
maybe ad runners realllly need the health
ok no its just garbage in that chest
never know because i always just get every chests casually ichimaiaAwk
bruh he had like no health wtf
you know something tells me all dungeons have nothing in them
considering we've literally found nothing useful in any of them ichimaiaAwk
hey at least temple of time isn't behind mirror ichimaiaAwk
be back in a min ✌️
AAAAA i blacked out  gm isthis till me seed?
giant enemy spider, doo doooo, dododododododododododooooo
@AppleQueenUwU did you make this seed
you know i don't like spiders but armagohma never really bothered me
@a_variety_pack i'm the same actually it just looks a little TOO fake i guess??
how many fused shadow u got
im pretty sure i put 3 onn  one ofsettings
So the swords are all overworld
hey now we can get the sky symbol ichimaiaAwk
maybe both swords are locked behind ichimaiaAwk
remember when we saw "no dungeons required" and we though it was a baby seed?
evil and fucked up and unfair settings
so these settings are  Me randomly pressing butttonscause idk what the settings do
i saw a seed where master sword was in treasure room.
so if we ever roll a seed for you, should we save you the trouble and turn hints off going forward 😏
I take back what I said about hints by the by in this game
my bet's on a sword being there
**VERY UNSAFE MATERIAL FOR A DILDO**
oh I meant having to do all the stuff to get to cats
this seed is *quality* in that it is so bad
no i watch beest i get it
**COUNTRY GIRLS DO NOT HAVE TO MAKE DO**
i have seen spoiler log, i am not allowed to say anything anymore etchyLMFAO
i only sent it u tmz just incase i passout again u didnt have to looook
normally how many sphere does a tp rando have
i think there's a bug if you do the howling stone it prevents doing it?
oh good I got back just in time for CATS
and the sky characters are MEGA cringe
its spread in like 3 dungeon
Dang nab it a red rupee
this is like the highest honor of a seed maker one could get
don't you like it it when your gf gets her memory back after being taken to the netherworld and in return she gives you 20 dollars
I aspire to make a seed this trollworthy
because of all these + Ilia quest there's 13 sphere ichimaiaAwk
+ city keys to reach the bulblin camp key
for comparison, how many spheres is a standard seed you do?
its like a chain of 8 checks lol
Maybe a Hero of Time has a pointy thing
that would have been really funny
I am thoroughly entertained and so are many others
I doubt Phantom wouldn't be here if the seed was THAT bad
a real glutton for punishment fatpidSip
you got 11 hearts, you're fiiiiiiiine
ik i passed out cause was like 3am and stuff but THANK u so much again making hospital not a bad and making me happy
just don't get hit by two or more
the only funny ass i wanna see is squidna's
i can see squidna i just i don't know either
who up in they twitch chat imagining squidna's ass tonight
i lost my second run to door jump
first run i was over 5m behind after manips and ended up getting a small pb
that was like 10 less bomb arrows than big moblin
because literally everyone who's taught me door jump has just said "its a rhythm i can't describe"
i was told to not mash it
i was literally 2m ahead again in DHC and stopped streaming because i was 3m behind and still there
i come back 2hrs later and all you have is a wood sword
some shit you just can't make up
i will say, one of the swords you will probably never find because you prob don't even know its a check
i didn't know it was one ichimaiaAwk
hey there's 2 other sword ichimaiaAwk
I'm tempted to think that a sword is going to be on Argorok
it's a good thing dungeons aren't required 😏
i'd hint you if it was actually required to get that one specifically because its messed up KEKW
can't say anything about that ichimaiaAwk
like in hidden village or whatever it's called
a cold wind blows is incredibly funny to say you're fucked
sky characters being required for a single key is so funny
I have one billion years of delay because mobile okay
when you get fed up with the seed
look lizalfos struggle in this game
2 times in a row is just incompetence
its been just swords for almost 2h KEKW
can I ask for the log so I can peek through it? Promise no spoilers, I just wanna see the sword locations so I can estimate how many more snacks I'll need tonight
corners in this game are fucked up
i bonk on so many of them
I take my snacking very srsly
Probably best to make yourself a meal then
I can't make a meal till Phantom beats the game
How about a basic Egg and potatoes
hot midna won't be around until then
the hit sounds for the wood sword so good NiceSoftlock
@morpheus080 its so funny with helm split NiceSoftlock
link just JUMP above the enemy and
i tried tilt n tumble on switch 2 and now my arm hurts
phantom can you show helm split to the wooden sword fans
not really no, controls felt way overtuned and i'm gonna start fresh tomorrow with the d-pad hack lol
like i'd barely tilt the control and the game would go 500 mph to that direction
kirby just wanted to fall off all the time
were you doing pape before or am i tripping
cake has been in a call with me for like 5 minutes
i will now never fail door jumping again
before this seed was a WORSEE seed
its okay the run was bad
Glubbers what were you doing wrong
and drop another fucking fake sword LOL
@BasilOuija i will rant in your dm's
i wish a cold wind was blowing it's over 100 degrees
I could go for a chilly breeze
the ice cream helped a bit
could be worse! could be argarok! oh wait. 😏
I just walked out of the bathroom, see my little brother and the first thing he says to me is: "I'm so drunk right now"
look it's the same music it's close enough
Come to think of it both of my brothers were out and about tonight while I was at home filling out surveys
i was in call with cake for 8 minutes
i think i spent longer *doing* the jump beforehand than that
the question here is is the eye really the bosses only weakness or is link just a dick
PLEASE be a trap I'm BEGGING
i can't believe pidgey is banned
Did you finally make progress yet btw?
the YT edit is going to be *fantastic*
yeah it's called the B&C swings 90 times in his face and stunlocks him
is it too late for a melatonin
gotta give king bulblin some props
do you need to be awake before 10am hex
I bet this seed wants you to do that for a sword
i mean he can withstand 93 ball and chain swings to the face
if you don't gotta be awake, go for it
i thought i was then i got in bed LMAO
oh god i know that feeling
i don't think i could survive one let alone 93
yeah but then i couldn't have raided you
yeah if you finished a while ago i would've raided bdamja again or something
it's slumber party vibes up in here rn
that was right before i left to stream lol
also you know the face link makes in skyward sword when he gets a rupoor
surely there won't be a 4th time
that's phantom at every check right now
94 Balls in the face incoming PAUSERS
94 balls to the face in the fight, 94 balls to the face! Swing it round, hips abound, 93 balls to the face in the fight
yeah idr exactly what it was
this is so dumb i absolutely love it
i just remember taking a hand off the controller and laughing while i ate
its okay mister orge i too am stun locked when im hit in face by balls
10/10 memorable seeds of all time
lmfaooooo whatever I just watched I love it
im okay with slightly psychopathic tendencies. better to be open and honest with it
he enjoyed getting smacked in the face with balls, look at him
And then he gives you the cold shoulder afterwards
wait that didn't sound as funny as earlier but still good
im very curious what brand of bullshit it requires you to do
I wanna know the secret third sword
the melly has been popped o7
also that is a lovely heart color
well if you're live when i wake up for work in 5.5 hours i'll ask you where the 2nd sword was
i’m still chillin but i’ll prob be taken out soon
i mean at this rate glubbers
but you also know that one of the sword you'll probably never find
why is shadow fusing is that a new power from black doom
GOT TAHT ONE RIGHT NEAR A KEY
i've been trying to time that for so long lmao
oh yeah, i was told to set my sights on "sub hour enter ToD" for now
basil may also just not be aware i don't sleep much period
like 5h is pretty normal for me, i'm winding down atm
you're almost getting into my bedtime timing
imagine living on the west coast
beest just pinged me in the TP discord OMEGALUL
gonna go get some water burgyLeave
anyways so yeah sub hour enter ToD right
they said that during the run that pb'd today, and i checked retroactively
my enter ToD was 1:17:42 OMEGALUL
what if at 3 AM it reset the clock back two hours so we all could get like two hours of extra sleep
so at like 2:59 it would go to 1.5:00
and at 2.5:59 it would just go to 3 like bro am
yeah but two hour extra sleep
smash squidna?? instructions unclear knuckles. is my meme approved
hex my ass read "1.5:00" as "1 and a half o clock"
or free time if you’re a night owl
do you feel like you're missing out
@TheGlubbers LMAO that’s the thoguht i had bc i was like “well what if you don’t know if it’s 1 o clock (1) or 1 o clock (2)
Glubbers I'm getting Hershey's ads again
what would you like me to do about it
same amount of time as normal if you use B&C
john universe should consider my idea
can you go to the store and buy me a Hershey bar
@hexspeedruns you should sub with Twitch Prime
ur random is the 5 hour
there's what, 8 treasure chests there?
fax machines are a crazy concept
i think it's 8 of each?
@theglubbers can you fax me some blue cheese?
yeah it'll be un-moldy via fax tho
that would make it just cheese then
please walk towards me slowly, Jojo style
please know that your suffering is bringing me much joy
i love how the two arrows just went through bro
basil thank you for being a shining light in the TP community
idk if phantom will be glad or mad shiruThink
@TheMasterZelda porque no los dos? PrideShrug
i was basically obligated to add that
i need to know the context
im here for treasure room then i go sleep
good news is hyrule castle will be ready to finish the game
I think I can guess the context for that one
TMZ trolling with vague statements is everything I wish to accomplish when I get handed spoiler logs tbh
hey i have that sword on my wall
I'm too nice to troll outside of constantly sipping a drink coyly
omg just in time for treasure room
that's some shitty armor if a wooden sword can break it
stream was good got a pb in totk ad
this seed is the stuff of nightmares and dreams
the only thing worse would be finding just one (1) sword
you can go kill argorok now
hey at least you found ONE
i think it's in the sky probably
its gonna take either 20m or 5h
this seed is an atrocity and i love it
this seed is a warcrime. Hilarious hilarious warcrimes
when i talked about the sword in treasure room earlier i still didn't see spoiler log KEKW
how many more checks are available? Does tracker tell you?
wha happen first  sword or phantom ask
how does link hold the third clawshot
tmz has been laughing for 5 hours straight i'm sure
jokes on you i'm laughing either ways
I know I've been laughin myself
hey tbh i remember without the spoiler log
trying to think what else we haven't seen
tmz only has spoiler log  incase i get  rushed around in hospital or pass out
one (1) check left in here ichimaiaAwk
if this is on the mountain does that make this grossly-colored snow
why the snow a funny color
basil give me back the brain cell
average new england experience: brown snow
Let me guess, PoT has a Sword
no I need it to live
remember when we were here 3 hours ago ichimaiaAwk
Best death kill in zelda history.
really taking out your frustrations on that boss aren't you
it was a good idea. that's why it was the wrong one
think of a bad idea that's where the master sword will be
tbh when i checked spoiler log and searched for "sword" it went to this chest and i was like "NOWAY"
I'm so curious about the third one
and you had 2.5k at some point too
no malo mart required sword in here
fave character hybrid the water goron
even worse than an ice trap
"like a normal person" what's that icysylvieHuh
idk how it got pass QA
idk either but it is bad and unfair
6 hr slammer on logic zachar4Shook tippiShock surprised my shots didnt kick in it
Can it heal with a sword
I'll probably make some spicy ramen for a snack
I still have that thing of pickle ramen
I swear these ad breaks get longer every time
maybe the true master sword are the friends we made along the way
holy fuck you're still at it
i have a secret for ads
I saw it at the grocery store and went 'oh that's cursed. I have to try it'
Yeah I bought Korean ramen because I was super upset yesterday with how someone annoyed me
no she just doesn't speak puppy
i'm concerned that the church wants you to bomb things
hey lil mantis hey lil mantis. i wanna see you stickbug dance all day long.
whats behind door number dynastid beetle
6 hour seed with "no dungeons required"
phantom if u ever wana bully someone just send them this seed?
all the AGGIES was blanked in ice
did you have a bad idea
phantom just a random question like that do you do MM randos? Clueless
i made probably the single worst mm plando
it requires some of the dumbest tricks to exist
i don't do any randos except i tried paper mario once
@TheMasterZelda lemme guess. all 5 fairies required, both skulltula houses, Goron Racing, beavers and Anju/Kafei
HAVE A BAD IDEA AND THATS WHERE IT IS
all u needed was my good rng
bo wasn't satisfied with ruining your runs
he stole your fucking sword too
swords were eziest check and hardest check what bonkers
master sword was sphere 2 KEKW
well, you're never forgetting these checks again
ok so idk where this is but
genuinely have no idea that existed KEKW
BoBoss stole the light from all of us.
IT WAS JUST THERE THE ENTIRE TIME
the sword just sitting there omfg
the most nonchalant grab of the mastersword ever
The fact it trolled us by being the shape of the sword being blinded to us
just like the castle town bridge...
a game where it took until 2019 to find out about one specific invisible rupee
there are so many fucking invisible rupees in MM
the randomiser bit jank tho  first seed  then this seed :P
if you shoot the middle of the clock on clock tower it drops 3 rupees
that was discovered in like 2019 KEKW
if you shoot some symbols in Pirate's Fortress they also drop rupees
i wonder how many rupees are normally there
oh, and the random crack on the wall outside west Clocktown, the shell on the top of that gate, and the guay you can find by looking at the swamp that slowly flies around
we need a new stream background now I survived the great tp rando. with a chicken Bo and a treasure chest for the room in each corner.
this seed is legendary. for all the wrong reasons
speaking of things in zelda games that are lesser known
sakurai did a great job making tp ganon into smash
oh. The fucking snowballs that shrink after you bring spring to Snowhead change, at the beginning of the road to the Mountain Village, and the pots outside of the Witches Hut post Woodfall too
did you know that in lttp if you use magic powder on the cucco under the pot in the house west of bottle merchant it turns into a woman
literal old man who cant do shit
another super unknown MM fact: if you play song of healing in Poe hut it gives you a discount for the minigame
it is yeah that's how i found out
heading to bed, thanks for stream and playing this it was painful
she's like "oh you must be who's been teasing my friends. i'm amazed i can talk."
and then she goes "i hate being human i want to be a chicken again"
@TheMasterZelda and if you do... what is it, day 3 honey and darlings? if you pay as Deku it's also cheaper
since we never had to use squidna can we deploy her during the final battle
speedrunning community didn't know about that one until a random chatter told a streamer to do it in the middle of a bingo
Magic Armor in this game gives u iron boot properties as a call back to OOT with Goron Tunic actually being more useful in water temple bc of spike immunity.
@stavros12c34anenoglou *some of iron boots properties*
you put them there very specifically
THATS FOR MOVING MY POTS OLD MAN
WUNSCHIES I desire an end to this seed.
sprawled out on the ground, that's gonna be phantom after this seed
clown ganon would be really funny
It'd be neat to do custom Zelda colors based on other Zeldas and other characters
to hell with this seed! 🎉
i mean plenty of ideas from her hyrule warriors costumes, pidgey
Is this seed gonna be interesting to rewatch? LUL
and now benedict cumberbatch will pronounce ganon dead
bye YT, seed was trash, like and subscribe for more terrible seeds like this one
the sword ice trap troll was funny
agitha having 6 ice traps was incredible too
I might have to watch the vod then
but to access city you needed goron mine
I got flashbacks to the SMRPG Rando where you constantly got screwed
you let those legendary pokemon escape
hidden rupee is a thing that exist
phantom's gonna turn off that grotto check permanently
I like having a 3rd klawshot existing.
ye ive said multiple times  i pressed random stuffs
OMG, it’s her, the Twilight Princess
I am no longer obligated to stay awake I'm going to bed gn
hey so that's a war crime
isn't any worse than oot chained dungeons lol
I would love to make a seed like that for you :^)
what's another war crime after the dozens this committed, pidgey
hyrule castle doesn't count because the door themselves aren't the loading zone
im like 95% sure of that
what would be the equivalent of the Geneva Convention in Hyrule you think
thank you for punishing phantom with it @AppleQueenUwU
10/10 ggs again 👏 this was a fun evening
this was a 11/10 seed nyacinthsLMAO
"i need to delete twitter" fixed your statement :)
thank you for suffering for our entertainment
Also, I think the answer is Hugo Juice
screw barrier skip, we need to get to the bottom of this super important question Kappa
depends on the method, but I'm perfectly satisfied with TP Any% rn
@SwiftPichu_ this is the best answer
Unless you want me to stream boobs you getting nothing
@blacktiger51 Dead is what I'm gonna do to you after saying it
ah the old "i'll just close my eyes a sec" four hours trick
just me having a minor meltdown
i was not anticipating anything like that at all
nah i'll send it to you
it's just not public for the next few days
tho i was sent that and now i'm distracted from work
Congrats on finding a poor bastard who did learn tmc BTW
Because no I was never gonna be one of them
open for a couple more days, last year there was a shitshow with them not letting anyone know for a long while
yeah it was like 3 weeks
Could pop an egg on the street and see if it cooks
i did this as a kid, harsh sun + 105F works with both asphalt and (slower) tin foil
When I went to college (it was like 98-107 around that) I'm sure when I had my black car an egg would be cooked in the hood
myth sent me the 1:56 comsob comparison
I had to use my hoodie sometimes to open the door for it being so hot, I burned my hand once
DHC is nearly 10 min itself
vaati + darknuts is about half of it
tmc glitchless, dog island, idr what else
i submitted basically the same stuff as pax
cuz either it's stuff i'm comfy on or it's tww, which i have to derust anyways
Will we get the phantoms in 5800 seconds? Kappa
no its the opinion i have therefore its correct
You said that like it's a first name basis thing lmao
the reality of no consequence in practice be like that fr
especially cuz it kinda is a yolo trick
Everyone here if you did not hear this today you are enough and deserve love and the very best out of life instan66Heart instan66Heart instan66Heart instan66Heart instan66Heart
@applequeenuwu yeah I have been watching been for a while now
Yeah, typically looking at the screen helps with gaming
In ads so can't hear you but not going anywhere
HUH its been 3 years already
SO ive been hospitalised for a year 180 days + 5 cause 5 days before i was hospitalised
"Game over yeah" as soon as the ads were over KEKW
How is everyone doing today I hope fantastic cuz you deserve it
It scary AND I NEED TO SAY BIG THANKY TO U PHANTOM FOR BEING HERE THROUGH IT ALL   IK  not directly but still THANKY U
yeah i mostly just make the "grab a bag of dicks" joke
i've only had them a few times
Wait is "dicks" the actual name of a food item?
We're thinking the same thing then
so you go there and eat a bag of dicks
It's been a long time though
yeah ketchup and mustard are gross so never trying that
you cant pick ketchup and mustard off burgers
where i went to college there was a separate place called dicks
I was in east coast when i had them
i know there aren't on the south side
Then we're probably talking about different establishments then
cap hill, north gate, maybe beacon hill?
My replacement desk frame has arrived and the broken leg has been swapped
they were probably (going to) dicks
ok so it might have had a different name LUL
idk why i thought sporting goods
nearest one to my office is cap hill
pink gorilla is also better on beacon hill
no there's ID and beacon hill
sp what are you planning for subtember?
still dont understand the whole faling into a hole and going to the start screen
how do these strats even get found
wow losing time on picking the heartcontainer
Is the title a topic for discussion or do you have an answer to the question
to be fair all ice dungeons suck ass in any zelda
Someone please catch me up to speed
or has any discussion taken place yet
went fine. then mistakes were made
@stalkor does droplet from minish count then YES
oot ice dungeon and the warm ice dungeon suiuuck
i think droplet is worst dungeon ever made
Is Hugo limited to what is available in his surrounding area or can he head to a store of some kind
if you know a dungeon and cheese half of it its great
Are we talking the Ordon village store or like a 7 Eleven
does it have to be real juice?
i was doing ILs and got a really good pb, then i went to any% and it went ok
Hugo prolly enjoys a fruit cocktail sort of thing
i have no bad habits, i'm infallible
Espeon seems more like a cat to me
hugos favourite juice is apple juice because it looks like piss. The reason why he drinks it is because he is stupid
leafy better be on that list
Damn, didn't know Hugo was a man of taste like that
erm the bot is posting crypto scam
i thought about it while taking my shower and found the answer
Hugo favorite juice is definitively pickle juice
i will take no other answer
why you ask? no reason. hugo just likes pickle juice
but also i dont drink lol
why do all alcohol mix sounds bad lol
it is in your stomach :)
"you two let him pass" proceed to not move
not doing risky iron boots strat Kappa
this trick is so cool and skip the worst room in the game
GLHF on the rest of the runnies
the funny strat will never die
sorry didnt hear got a lot of noise
i think ive seen it? close to a year tho
switched back to tp 1 week
i am still amazed to this day that we barely make it to the bottom of the room in time
Clueless not that ive seen someone do it
the only hard thing us recognizing the pattern is owning you
TP quickspin kinda own me because i go too fast all the time
i disagree but respect your opinion
I just don't like the sailing
you can tell thats when they started to rush lol
Should still get around to beating it some day tho... have no more excuses with it being on nso and all
i like wind temple and earth temple but i can see the argument
the escort aspect is definitively not great
in HD its not as bad at least
they just made everything reasonably faster
hd is the only way to play wind waker tbh and not go insane
songs don't play another time everytime
what are your thoughts on it lol
i like wind waker rando but there's some stuff that should be documented that is not
maybe thats why they allow glitches lol
tbh there's a reason they added super quick sail lol
wait i messed up the joke
what are your thoughts on skyward sword
You know what they say, 15th time's the charm
controls really depend on the setup
if you have a scuffed setup yea its bad
yeah its a little weird lmao
i vibe with SS motion controls
it just comes naturally to me
switch 2 joycons are much better for SS
they don't desync constantly nearly as much
i will say, SS second half has my favorites dungeons in the franchise overall
second dungeon is.... yea it exist
third dungeon is cool but overshadowed hard by the 5th dungeon
hes only the boss in 2 dungeons right
well you do see him again in the second dungeon but don't fight him
i wish he wasn't the dungeon boss is my only nitpick
also his first fight is def the worst one imo
only thing i can suggest is jotwad
I LOVE THE SONG REFERENCE <3
waterp7GG dylanjGG avarie1GG zachar4GG nice push forward on the finish out.
i wish there was a morpheel skip ichimaiaAwk
on a happoer note i got a grade 9 mamoswine holo from power keepers
what is a normal downleft notch
oh yea just angle matter duh
diagonals are usually the bad ones
but its legal for oot Kappa
are they made by more than one single person now?
i think that's what made MM community decide to now allow it in the end
even on n64 its hard to do
yea mm doesn't have as many
i was there when it was voted and i remember one of the big point was that availability of them isn't great
ok but google kinda bad anyway
the other day i was looking for a song, with the exact name, and it just wouldn't give me anything related whatsoever
I think this song is the exact same in Gale but it's been a little while.
It changes ever so slightly I believe
I always thought the rose town is fitting if you put a clown there
what game is this song from?
last night i had my worst AP ever, i literally sat there for 2 hours with nothing to do and 3 others werre in the same boat
yeah it's a nice song. For a sec I was like is this some NIER song I've forgotten and then the guitar kicked in and I was like nvm lmao.
normally i finish a banjo seed in 4 hours... i reached my 3rd world at 4 and a half hours
im okay, went on new meds this week so that takes some adjusting
change lunch schedules, sleep schedule, side effects, ect.
I wish I could sleep more than 7 hours
I burned down my all timer schedule no issues moment in college
im pretty good about going to sleep. I lay down, turn off the light, and turn on ceiling fan. Im normally out in 5-10 minutes if im relaxed enough
oh no it's spelled with an i
and then when I struggle I pokemon fire red on my DS lite. That makes me sleepy for some reason
They're allowed to be unhinged and there's no issue, I make one anal joke, swifFine
i found it a few years ago on google docs and i really liked it rish33
but this gl was for realsies
Unless it's the throat goat in which case
Everyone I watched has retired but you, glub and beest
No no, I give her shit and dip
Tgd was just learning when I was already watching lol
I honestly thought the shufflizer vods would never end
i'm answering the title question lol
that's crazy, that was amazing content
i use it for my stream stuff lol
I guess it does hate series true
which I find funny after I feel like LP's built the gaming platform
So which is it YouTube, make up your goddamn minds
what the hell do you tag it too now that's crazy
@Axl_SR YouTube has “categories” for specific games
good thing you have a retrotink 4k
When does the ESS adapter come in ooc?
YouTube keeps doing stupid stuff but we can’t help but use it.
ah so probably a couple weeks
Yo Axl, hope you've been doing good!
I was only off by a power of 10 phanto274Flushed
good day today, new cover of butter-fly dropped
posted it in your server for you to check out when you can
I gotta ask since Monado said you had one but how do you like your MemCard PRO GC?
I'm assuming it plays well with the homebrew stuff for wii and gc too?
I guess it would make it easier for GC since it has an sd card Hmmm
Ah, so it really is just like a giant capacity oem card
That does still sound good, it's going on the future list
i had a PS1 memory card like that back in the day. it randomly wiped a page and that's how i lost my FF9 endgame save lol
You posted the clip I made :D
Test dummy reporting for duty o7
fix the error then maybe link will clip thru the gate LUL
It's true this is all PhantomGamesBot's fault that bastard
its called a speedRUN. Not a speedSTAND
i have a minish cap question
randomly ill do a roll into spin attack, how does that work?
did you know the original horse was called Pona?
but because its digital its now E-Pona
Well done, I love a good groaner
on the way home from lunch with maddy's parents today we passed a new place called RNG Smoke Shop
just count what frame you're on and it won't be RNG :P
"yeah gimme the good stuff" "i'll try but you gotta be lucky. but hey use this stamp card, on your tenth stamp you get a pity draw"
what did jr do this time?
yeah that's why i know some communities stopped doing joke bans like that
i dont even remember what i said to get banned
does it show up on every message? lmao.
joke timeouts are just as effective
@TheMasterZelda I don't either beyond JR saying it was his birthday
I'm quite fond of Fira Code phanto274Lurk gl TP
oh yea it was because of the vomit emoji thing
the flag should be remove when they get un ban but i doubt that be easy to do
so they just get shadow banned? LUL
oh god I had wiped the vomit thing out of my brain phanto274Fine
is there a way to do it without going to the mod view
pls no ban im innocent icysylviePray
i always had to do it from the mod view and wait for them to type again for some reason
for a while everytime i chatted in butter chat i was restricted lol
Yeah if you get banned in any of those ones you don't want them
i know butter and cats at least were connected. Cant I was meme banned and it carried over to cats lol
it had been a while since my last permaban tbh Mhm
Wasn’t sure how far the Monado Cinematic Universe went
inspired by chat today for that title, eh?
avarie1Hmm are you okay with bro, it is worth being explicit
i'm still wondering how many rupees his invisible ones are
fuck you Bo for keeping the sword the other day
okay, i use them that way too but not everyone agrees LOL
@Amishman19 Actually, it was me. I don’t know why I said it
@potato_girl___ lmao what a plot twist
bro and dude are def gender neutral to me and im east coast lol
I’m not even American and I use dude neutrally
homeslice sounds like a hidden skill or something
i also use man gender neutrally but that's more universal i feel
he slices bo's home in half for KEEPING THE DAMN SWORD
kills ilia? sign me TF up
i just popped in and thats the first thing heard lmao
im almost done routing my stupid pkmn romhack btw nyacinthsShook
6pm has been the nend of my dayt the last two weeks owth this new work schedule
but yeha been having to wake up at 4am every day mon-fri
get home at like 5-530, go to bed for 8pm
four more weeks to go :')
oh sorry 7 am start nvm
Hey she can't be much farther north than me it's nor frozen yet Sadge
no, the late night paving is what makes me have to leave for work TWO HOURS EARLY
It is getting dark at 9:30 and I don't like it though
Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1  for the boy who didnt get his alert
I keep thinking of Around the World by Daft Punk for some reason
Well that was a diplomatic way of saying it
sounds like a child writing their first fanficiton, she stared into her large blue orbs
that bar IS on the ground tho
i won't say the c word
we need a heck emote that replaces it with HELL
@Amishman19 i didn't know you were a sanitation worker
@Amishman19 or a hecc emote that replaces shit
for most common usage of heck I think of "what the heck"
what is that game over sound from lmao
@potato_girl___ I would take that too
you've told me and I forget
I know I knew at one point
some racing game iirc that's my hint.
a game i prob wont ever play
broo if 2/3 of my message is replaced with emotes you might have gone too far
does it automatically play when you reset or do you trigger it manually
is that alleged hardest zelda to glitch zelda twilight princess??
It’s from the Sega Rally series  when you get a game over. The Sega Rally 2 variation is the most popular and the version used in Phantom’s reset

is she a weed person or does she just find it funny
Oh man I was way too slow
to be fair these are hilarious
ngl i heard WEEB not WEED
oh yeah phantom that reminds me
The funny thing is that I hear the SR2 game over jingle so often I almost forget that’s its origin
(that joke is for any ESPN fans out there...)
there's an island in antarctica called EGG ISLAND and on wplace there's a bunch of eggs... including egg
If I ever get into speedrunning I want to use the Total Distortion Game Over song for my reset sound effect LUL
reminds me of the command i made in TGH's chat years ago for blaino
I dipped for a bit sorry
yeah if you type out !blaino you get "Fuck you you punch-dodging fucker get out of the fucking ring already!!"
but it's still funny for LA
there had to be one that doesn't listen AINTNOWAY
always one motherfucker trying to get fresh
can we do this at pax
Get into a fight at a BJs?
get into a fight OVER a pj?? sounds like waffle house
@PeachedPocky At least WF late at night
what's that about adding a quote
i even corrected it for ya
Oh shit I had no idea I could evne quote as VIP
i got yelled at for making a dark joke at work today. one of the white hats awas talking about how their dad left them when they were young blah blah blah
they said they "left for cigarettes and never came back" to which i replied, "well yeah have you SEEN the price of cigarettes??"
they did not find that nearly as funny as i did
@PeachedPocky well I'm on your side altho my dad never left me for a pack of cigarettes so maybe I just don't understand hardship. He left me for a pack of Coors.
i make dark jokes about my dad. what's he gonna do, he's a pile of ashes
Flo trying to explain what a vacation is when she hasn't been on one either
i have a viewer whose entire chat identity is making jokes about how their dad left them, its wonderful and maybe has rubbed off on  me
also my dark sense of humor is in part from that side of the family so they'd enjoy it
Wait that Dog game? I knew I was thinking of the right one
they literally told my cousin to name her dog the portuguese word for penis. and the dog got out. so she was shouting on the street that her [name] ran away, her big hairy [name] ran away
but i think it started when me and my friend would make jokes about how their dad was hot (he killed himself in a house fire)
The only dog game I've played is Jerry Rice and Nitus' Dog Football.
my dad and uncle were on the sidewalk dead with laughter
Well and Okami and this but those are wolf games.
@Mirby_Studios I'm trying to figure out if this is an extension of the dark joke
finally made it past hugo, wild
this will be an interesting pb vod
@Amishman19 no the joke was that she was screaming her hairy penis ran away
@PeachedPocky Listen it started with dead dad jokes...
yeah and that's the level of joke my dad's side of the family loves, so they'd be fine with dead dad jokes
i love dark humor, my family doesnt
it sounds like you have a license to kill
my family still thinks making racist jokes is edgy so we dont share the same level of humor
dark humor is what fuel me through life
I like dark humour but I also don’t make those kinda jokes
I feel like i need one lol
is EMS the one people find most issue with learning?
@AnniLyn2 Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just be swimming, swimming, swimming
which one is pillar clip again?
oh is that the underwater one with ironboots or am I thinking of a different trick
anything with breath limit sounds bad
did you say fuck too many times?
only 3 and a half hours oh boy
listen you've got 14/273 runs finished surely this one makes it
i love mm and its speedrun but holy fuck why is right after first cycle the biggest reset point always
It would be cool if it showed you how many runs have gotten to where you're at currently.
livesplit core should do this natively.... whenever its completed
i took a look at livesplit code once
You heard it, you're getting punished for considering dark humour
phantom i think i need whatever code you're using to display ad timer cause the code i was using broke? i didn't change it but i guess twitch changed something?
its sooooo tied to win32 its kinda insane
I gotta say I would love the TP LinkFALL noise as a sound bite
Oh yeah if someone DMs me and I read it and don't respond immediately I will forget it exists LUL
cool thing I just came vack to
But the bombs are so tasty and delicious
back to square one I guess
you got to play the game a bit at least
brb may hugo get that juice
Are you going to play this season or was it mostly just to help Rigby test
it do be time consuming that’s fair
as someone that knows very little about the settings or the rando in general besides watching you dungeon rando being part of the default race settings seems a bit odd.
depending on your group and it ended up 14 for each one
I still have to try the settings but I know the blocks are going to fuck me up since I never played with the settings
I didn’t play that season and those settings sounded rough
I feel like 8-10 is the sweet spot
that's how I feel about rocks too
As someone who has been doing FF6 Rando recently they are also very lax which is nice.
yeah if you can’t upload it it’s tough to keep doing it
I even see it like when MegaPaul does DKR versus PMR
yup everything off and no mic
I love the Pape ones so much more for that as nice as having a race restream is
yup, i will be learning it ssonicAYAYA
Once Okami rando is a thing I'm gonna be playing that every day till I master it LUL
i'll be exploring the other categories too
NG+ you just buy a ton of exorcism slips and murder everything in 2 seconds iirc.
which I mean that's NG too but only really the 2nd half cause you don't have the money.
i'm pretty stoked to learning the game soon
all games need a category where you get time bonuses for hitting totally unnecessary flashy 1 frame things LUL
my first favorite google font ever was Nunito
the first of like 20 most annoying tricks in the run LUL
its a roundedish sans serif font
do they call him Hugo cause he makes everyone Les Miserables?
wow thanks for the compliment midna
is it the quote i made on- yeah fighting over a bj
i need to rewrite my bot and i only recently wrote it
something about reconnect requests killing the oauth
Quote 9999: Game Over Yeeaaaaah! - Sega Rally 2 [Every Game] [Every Stream]
Oh boy, favorite font time? Gosh, Probably Libertinus Serif. A nice classic Roman type, and under a permissive license. It's the official font of my software project!
Oh, and I hope you're well and all that.
After seeing TAS goats, any human effort looks sloppier'n a raw egg on the floor.
How has all ur days been?
Why would you wanna do that
no matter when i go to Bedge i wake up 11 am to 12 pm no matter what
when i took anxiety meds i got up earlier for a week but too many side effects. when i stopped i slowly reverted back to how i was
Oh so the beest morph switch will happen here as well.
I see his pb finished runs but wont unlurk for a GG like he broke the barrier today but I am not white lying when i cant make his streams anymore
I have no PTO, so i ain't goin
how's prices for flights to AGDQ
Shit, prices for me are 367
Even my flights have layovers lol
i did the cave of shadows recently and it made me remember how ass the targeting is
Pittsburgh always snows on the most important days. Ill never forgive nature from stoppping me from seeing pope marco dope and morph in person. Like I get it the Philly Car show was fantastic on the company appearance's and show outs but my plane refused to go there.
Well just know, you're always welcome in my room
My boss told me "I still have your email unchecked for when I make PTO schedule for 2026"
So i assume I'm getting it off
to watch you through frosted glass
did you get 3 bad swings?
Thanks it was good, played through Kirby Adventure on the NES
i got a good run that died to rupee roll cause i yolo'd the aim abit too hard
then i learned FT 100% IL which was really fun
For me it's between that and the new 3D Kirby on the Switch
Kirby Crystal Shards needs a remake sequel badly.
That's one of the things I like about Kirby Adventure, they hadn't completely removed the difficulty yet
Why cant they give kirby 2 power ups in any of the newer games is beyond me
yeah it was alright did all kilton medals
your last run? I can go check
papyrus isnt on google fonts this is bullshit
i don't think finkheavy is on google fonts either
either do I im on a p5 watch drought and with bingsf gone from botw im blanked on botw knowledge
found it, and it is strange, I am really not sure
how many channel points will it cost to get you to play a randomizer you've never played before? LUL
Epona is the 12 year old in this game while in Echoes its Link thats the 12 year old. Why cant they just give us fair Ai partners but no the dev team hates us.
damn all that wasted time D:
so 30 hops would be 1 in 268 million that'd be fun.
Link can't hop and mind control the boomerang at the same time. He's not a good multitasker.
this will go much better definitely
all i heard was "fuck you" and then my browser crashed the video and now wont reload it lmao
thanks twitch finally laoded the video
literally all i heard was "fuck you" then it just crashed
yeah it was def on twitch's end
it was saying there was an error with the player for me at least
yeah same, saying it was a network error or whatever, but the othher people im lurking had no issuer
love very precise tricks that cost a minute if you fuck them up nearly an hour into a 4 hour run :(
And to all a goodbye bbvtPeaceOut
At least it's not vine clips
i mean, even by a second a pb is a pb
Well it's also on the theoretical you keep composure
That's why I don't trust bpt
I meant you lmao, I know morph was in smash
that's when you pick the hot one instead
whatever option doesn't get me put into prison
@TheGlubbers Shut your bitch ass up fuckwad
rosalina if we're going mario princesses
"we made her tall for mario kart" --nintendo
i was surprised there wasn't more rosa costumes
but the aurora dress is top tier
yeah that's paul, he clips through the floor sometimes
he can target you and try to follow you from above as you go back to the kitchen area and clip through where the floor meets the wall
he then falls down to your level but also keeps clipping and falls out of bounds
and if this happens, it happens in front of you as you pass by so you watch the whole thing
Now you see him, now you don't
You got a blue rupee (5)!
Does AD route the spr yellows?
no the SPR yellows, there's yellows in random boxes on 2f NE wing
Yes those random ass boxes and definitely not the knight armor
what do you think they did in medieval times about long nails
Motherfucker you don't want needles as nails
Or maybe you do in those times
the answer is that trimming nails with something reminiscent of a clipper apparently dates back to 800 bc
The fuck did they use, a wolf?
and before that there's descriptions that imply knives were used
or late but it's pretty easy to know which
it's a 6f window to get a sidehop, frames 1/2 = fall, frames 3-5 = good, frame 6 = fall
Back from pizza dinner and nice epic timing stuff now
pope likes staring at her tits
i was expecting it to be a question about the FT thing which i answered in the discord
idk guess you have a cage match with variety
wasn't that when we were talking about getting into a fight at BJs I thought it was related to that but maybe I'm wrong.
lucky you, you actually know the person you have to cage match
i'm supposed to match a person named kara and i have no clue who the fuck she is
I finally found Blaze the Cat merch
general idea is that you stand in a specific spot (lenient enough to not stop moving and do it while walking), and attack at a roughly specific angle so the spawn bounces to where it happened to this time
It's her, Jet, Espio, and fuckin NEO METAL SONIC
.....cuz I ship Sonic/Blaze and I wanted a Blaze to match my Sonic figures
I have Silver/Amy and Knuckles/Rouge merch, but Blaze took till now
Tho I only have an Amy figure keychain
Also I got it for $3
I like comic sans (TGD quote)
can i have mod for a quick second
@theglubbers no I don’t want to get banned again
I keep getting bit by mf mosquitos
As I've grown, I've started to hate mosquitoes more and fear spiders less
i didnt think you actually wanted to know about google fonts i thought th at was just a bit, but mine is prob Delius
brb got to change that Kappa
Yo this Beetlejuice figure I got is fuckin sick
you were fine to warp there but no the cutscene didn't activate
Twitch says you're 38 min in to stream :P
just do a chrono trigger run
Yes please I looooove Twilight Princess
I wonder if Twilight Princess was anyone's furry awakening
This is my favorite game but yeah that's fine lol
I grew up with Twilight Princess
my favorite thing was someone asking for help on UMD and teabag saying "don't do what glubbers does"
the setup is just "do the trick what's so hard about it?"
tbf the trigger is pretty easy to see
if the runs bad i dash at the cutscene trigger YEP
I grew up with TP at home aka Okami.
I want nothing to do with sonic music right now man
Altho the Sonic 06 version of All Hail Shadow is so much better.
.....I'm wearing a Shadow shirt and hat rn
The released like 7 remixes from the game and they are
you're not doing everythingsanity at pax? smh
And they murdered windmill isle right in front of me
the late 90s and early-mid 2000s sonic games had such incredible songs. Particularly Sonic R, Sonic 06, and Secret Rings.
Current sonic music just makes me sad
@splashv_ I dunno, I like it a lot
Like some of it is really good but with crossworlds I'm at my wits end
I can't judge cuz there isn't a clean version of it online
Well they just released clean verisons yesterday
my favorite font is times new roman
oh gosh one of the top fonts rn has text that actually goes out of the usual bounds
Y'know what streamer prime what's your favorite font
Uhh Jost looks interesting I guess. It feels like 'generic website text' font
So apparently the desk is on sale even lower now FailFish
But like, if you could find out after EMS that Hugo would have 1 cycled
Oohhh wait "Sankofa Display" looks absolutely insane and I'm here for it
It looks like if an alien learned what English letters were and wrote them
well there's 2 boots to a pair so they're as likely as one another
But the good news is I finally got my desk partially set up last night. Computer and a couple monitors. Still need to get everything properly mounted and such
And hopefully I can get the chair ordered soon. I'm debating if I wait for Labor day for a potential sale or just get it next week to ease the pain
No reason at all you say? Am i actually going to have real competition in s5?!?!?(jk im probably skipping s5)
Oh and I probably need to get a new GPU soon so that's extra fun YEP
So yeah new GPU extra fun YEP
me personally i just prefer having overworld coins when compared to panels and i just don't like dungeon shuffle but that's mostly a me thing
it's still kinda Toybox for go mode tbh
it's still the second most check dense
(but actually my GF just works overnights so i don't have access to my PC before 6:30pm PT)
i am at the level with games of either i have no competition, or the competition i do have is so far above me its actually beyond my ability to be a threat to them
Phantom handicap: You have to clear 5 chapters
Weird flex cus i won season 3 Kappa
oh wait there was 5 in your pool duh
petition to remove kooper from the game
it's very bright in that room idk why that would confuse anyone lol
don't forget to check your checks like the animal crossing developers
they wrote an if condition, then inside the block wrote a bool for the same condition and then checked the bool
i remember that one super heavy glitch ruleset that one season lol
never thought I would hear that
Phantom are you going to buy the Bubsy collection
I was one of the few souls who actually had Bubsy on SNES growing up
Everytime I saw a gaming youtuber talk about Bubsy I was just like "Oh, it's Bubsy"
bombette behind 120 power stars hidden inside bowser castle prison cell
The Bubsy hate train was real
The collection also includes the only episode of the Bubsy TV show
thats how i feel about midna tbh
It never got past the pilot lol
Most of the episode is Bubsy possessing a dangerous item and literally saying into the camera "What could possibly go wrong?"
Oh yeah the lead Sonic Mania guy revealed they worked on a scrapped prototype for what was most likely Sonic Mania 2
i feel like pennys big breakaway was the sonic mania team trying to give ristar a mainline 3d game but they had to retheme it when sega had no interest
@TomaThePolliwog Oh I've never thought of the Ristar comparison to that game
cause pennys yoyo is just like ristars arms
Makes Sonic Superstar all the more confusing
Wonder why Evening Star and or SEGA didn't go through with Mania 2
probably cheaper to just do mania dlc
who needs watt upgrades when you can have 3 heal final bowser bradha1TubbaCry
Because the reason why Sonic Superstar turned out the way it did was because everyone involved with Sonic Mania were busy with other projects
Get Arzest out the KITCHEN. The "best" they've done is Superstars, and that's mid AF
I need to watch better players to understand how
Why compete when you already know you're the GOAT
I can do neither fast bradha1Laugh
i was about to say i used to love watching the titans play lol
you, m4 and jcog were so fun to watch play against each other
On the one hand, I get that
on the other hand, it makes it really disheartening for newcomers like me to to hear “but it’s no good now”
i've had way more fun figuring out how to get better at the broken parts of the game than racing
basic movement optimization matter a lot more than people think
that's applicable to almost every games
good routing does matter a lot still
but i can see it not mattering as much in this as in like oot or mm
Something awsm happened. bc ur run ended it the way it did. I went to a festival and not only went 1 lap around but 4 times. had a decent chatoffs to boot. Some spots my dad used to sit around and eat. GL on rando.
oot has some mega out of the way checks everywhere
fitting them in movement across areas is a huge part of rando routing
always wondered why exactly are those a thing
no lie pape randos should and could be harder. prologue skip is a MUST and NEED.
what's the hp threshold to prevent heal?
so it depend on your max hp
my ass is NOT playing video games to do math
all i remember id if you at 1 hp he doesn't heal NODDERS
yea but the spreadsheet wouldn't tell me how it work
if it wasn't for lightning, you'd have sub 2'd. Probably.
Veggies?  Well not a fan of how most peas are texturally and dislike the big head bean sprouts
Otherwise I'm fine with most veggies
What did I learn about vegetables recently? idk the fact that Veggietales exists but that's not recent
fun fact: that show was produced in my hometown
another fun fact: I just doxed myself by saying that
The reason it caught on as much as it did because unlike literally every other religious show for kids Veggietales actually knows how to entertain an audience
i was always told it was a vegetable but i know it was a  fruit
One thing I still don't understand to this day is that Chuck E Cheese restaurants for some reason played Silly Songs with Larry in their locations
Yeah it was like a musical intermission they have in every episode
i was home school most of my life
hospital today been bad lots of pain  but once again u help by streamy
Very recently I streamed my self playing the Veggietales GBA game in a voice call
The GBA game is literally a Mario VS Donkey Kong clone
I think it's pretty fun mostly because you can do movement tech to skip parts of the levels
Also the final boss is pong
The PS2 game is a 3D platformer with an impressive budget for a Veggietales game
I learned apparently you can start to grow peppers indoors and then transplant them outdoors once the weather is appropriate
I have learned nothing about vegetables. phanto274Lurk Hope the runs go well.
ok recent discovery. 7month old daughter loves eating veggies
probably until she finds out other stuff is better
ah yes. also she satys in her room and has no access to the outside world forever
hugo no pickle juice for you today Madge
How you're doing today & happy blessed Saturday I love this game
That's great glad to hear 😀
at least you can skip the intro cutscene :)
What exactly are you trying to do here 🤔
Yes this game I've played it 25 minutes ago. Took much needed break
You should have gotten a heart container for beating that in less 2 minutes
I just got a Sonic propeller toy from the Boom era
Found it at a thrift store for $1
quacks at phantom cause me dumb
I've been boiling potatoes w/ mixed veggies of late, if that counts
honestly? it's better than I expected
Hell yeah clip into the pillar LETSGO
just like you said, you clip into a pillar
I learned that roasting garden-fresh carrots and potatoes really brings out the sweetness of them.
yeah, roasting is definitely the way to go with a bunch of store bought stuff
I was hoping my carrots would be sweet from the garden but alas, they needed help
also, someone landed a triple protect at Pokemon worlds to secure a game to get into top 4
I don't know anything about TCG. I do play Pocket though
I'm flubbing the question because I've been thinking and can't think of anything but the fact I learned I'm not allergic to dates recently
that cost 1 energy to use too what the fuck
Gholdengo is already good enough in the VG peepoSad
and its not damage from detaching energy, ITS DISCARDING FROM YOUR HAND KEKW
yeah Pokémon need a ban list
this may be the most broken card i've ever seen
you're talking about the Genesect that allows you to tutor 2 steel pokemon?
it literally doesn't need any support wtf
oh my god that genesect card is busted with it
the power creep is ridiculous KEKW
200+6 damage counter for 2 energy, alright
does that do 200 plus the 6 damage counters anywhere?
im so glad i dropped pokemon tcg LOL
oh yea but that one has a trade off
oh so it can just kill anything retreated pretty much
stage 2 just means you have to have breeder
charizard ex with the +100 damage if it has damage counters?
this is the tera dark cahrizard?
just like how it is in VG: the middle evolutions tend to get ignored
"here's a Prize, I KO your active"
I think the most TCG I played was the Pokemon play it game as a kid but even I can see how stupid these are lol
when I played TCG, energy removal had no drawback
you just put your opponent behind a turn and that was it
60 damage swing from an ability seems pretty nuts
how long i need to stay up for rest of run
Did you get another run going yesterday? I had to head out around 5 your time I think and I didn't get to see unfort
been watching for like an hour peepoCozy
I don't think I saw snowpeak, think I saw until right after the crazy diababa
angry i like this one it's a hedgehog
whenever it was added was more than 7 months ago lmao
so Phantom today i was grinding in a Pokemon Randomizer and found a shiny Skiploom
i have never felt so calm encountering a shiny before
i thought about killing it but eh it's a shiny
if its in a rando i just don't care usually
or if its a mon i really like
i would transfer it but i'm also doing random moves evos and abilities so it wouldn't really be legal i guess
Shinies are just worse in gen 2 as well iirc
okay I must be remembering the odd egg ones having ass DV's
I do remember that cause it was like 0-7 female and 8-15 male
right depending on the gender ratio of the species
definitely a weird way of determining it
the skiploom has cloud nine as it's ability and it knows bubble judgement extremespeed and fire fang lol
ahhhh right that makes some sense cause of the time capsule
not dead just dead to you catSmile
ohhhh so you can't get lost
wicked all my homies hate fishing rods anyway
yeah i was gonna say this reenabled them
idk how people discover this stuff but that's cool
yeah that one i've definitely seen
i used to watch a lot of tp speedruns but i guess i just always spaced out during the warp interrupt
im done icysylvieLetsGo finished making the route
that would explain it then yeah
darkhammer kinda sounds like King Hippo from Punch Out wii
it's a stupidly fun game actually
i always thought it was very weird fur
I always felt like some kind of sweater
damn never seen that strat either
i don't think i've ever sat through an entire 100% run
so if that's not her fur then like what even is she
You know maybe it is died fur
or a weird pattern that grows that way
I'm finally making saves for my any percent route and I must say the clamp is so nice for doing other things during prologue
not a vegetable at all but a coworker told me they made deviled eggs with pickled eggs and i think thats a war crime tbh
that's a mix that does not need to exist
@Amishman19 thankyou! for agreeing with me! other people did not!!
i wanna learn a tp speedrun
not for any kind of record or anything, but just because i should (itll have to be throigh emulator)
whats the most "beginner friendly" run to learn for tp?
in my brief time trying to learn this game i just did master sword rta
You're my background noise while I cook alfredo sauce
that is a good question tho, so maybe what would be the best run to learn in regards to learning usefull tricks?
i find that to be a big defining factor with me vs other racers, is alot of y'all know and practice sr strats that i just dont know lmao
@PeachedPocky I like pickled eggs fine but I don't think you should devil them OhNoWhatHappenedToJoel
thats the one that starts with the map glitch at zoras domain right? i think ive seen you do that one a few times
that would propbably be the most useful one to learn, mostly bcuz i need more tricks for arbiters (poe one skip infuriates me)
i learned the chest room lja in snowpeak from you, and i can do ladder skip, thats all i know for snowpeak
yeah theres the extra wait time since no fast climb, i learned that one when i was doing the vanilla playthrough lmao
i wanna learn kitty climb in gm, that seems so helpful lmao
i learned the big key skip for this for bingo purposes, but i wouldnt say im 100% confident in it
uhhh top of stairs facing you as you walk in entrance, you lja to the bottom of the stairs via chanelier targeting
yeah thats how nozz taught me
i have only ever chased him down lmao
i always thought this boss phase was impossible to get injnured by, didn;t realize they had an attack
i must be off but gl with the run wolfyh2Pat
imagine a run dying bcuz you got hit with a rock
im not even monitized, but i throw the counter claims anyways bcuz no soundcloud rapper this song isnt yours go yell at nintendo lawyers about it
how do they think they'll win that
i always just link to nintendo's fair use article or whatever and say something along the lines of "either this was a mistake from the claim system or you're committing fraud"
No no Now if you claim a video you can opt to just remove monetization instead of it being held in escrow
So it just makes no money for either party until the claim is resolved
So even if you win, all that time and views just poof no revenue
i forgot you had the mastersword and was very confused for a second there when you became a man
He must be swift as a coursing river
i just forget this is part of the run to have it early lmao
With all the force of a great typhoon
See the rain? That's the typhoon NODDERS
with all the rage of a blazing fire
rage of a raging fire? that doesnt sound right
It's all the strength of a raging fire
Don't worry the Disney lawyers will be here to take of you soon
you know, i give link alot of shit, but climbing a straight up and down ladder is a pain in the ass, actually
Huh... I just got a Nier advertisement... I don't think they had anything new lately
I picked up a copy during the sale last week
Probably a silly idea but meh
i still hjavent played any of those games
I was tempted and it was cheaper than Clair Obscur
I don't usually care for the game play style of either one, but the stories to both were outstanding from what I've heard so I figured why not
Nier was $13 and that's in the range of "If I play this for 3 hours and never again still not the worst amount I've paid"
and if it's clear from the first hour that I will never enjoy playing it
if it the 1st nier you might of wasted 13 bucks
I didn't know there were multiple
oh i just looked it up, repplicant?
well the og version of  Replicant
There was one I saw for the Switch
thats the only version i can see on steam
i had it on xbox 360
and i did actually beat it
So I bought Automata, but I see Replicant, but Replicant is the prequel, so which are you calling the 'first'
@Zeliversal Automata is the good 1
Ah okay I only saw the steam release dates
Yeah that's the one I got for $13 then
i struggle with this so much
I didn't even know Replicant existed
It came out later on steam so that's obviously the intended gameplay order Kappa
But yeah if Clair Obscur ends up on a hecking fall/winter sale I might try it
The game play doesn't at all seem my style but they cooked with the story
Clair Obscur is worth the full price tag imo
thats another one i gott aplay, i hagve it on gamepass but yeha
Yeah but I'm not gonna spend $60 on something I'll never play again
YEP worth the full 64.99 can
only if my money was worth more KEKW
i (canadian) had to switch my steam account to american to join my friends family library, so i get access to all their games, however i do need to buy american steam cards on g2a to buy games
But hopefully I'll have some money come in next week so I can afford to buy chair
its worth it being in the family library with 4 other people all with unique extensive libraries
only person i watch regularly play this is you tbh
but i was trying to get my game to launch and missed whatever yoy were referring to
@PeachedPocky You clip through the wall and then behind the gate
very "if it can bleed it can die" type skip
It requires using the hookshot on a skeleton at a extremely precise location, and then you have to use a LJA and get pushed out to the outside of the gate
A good SS is faster than the boss, a bad one is slower
And depending on how it goes it requires voiding and setting up the whole thing again
I believe once you clip into the wall, it's easier to wait for the right setup
But if you don't clip into the wall or clip back out without getting outside the gate, it requires redoing it
lurking, gl on the rest of the run
But to Phantom's point, redoing the trick feels a lot less painful that dealing with all the shenanigans of Stallord
I wish I had gotten more crests before Pixelsmithy closed up shop for them
ACTION flails arm vaguely in a direction
I need to start considering how I'm gonna put this loom together fatpidTHONK I'm finally armed with a jig saw and HUBRIS
I do not think duct tape will hold wood together under considerable tension
you know, I had to double take like 3 times to make sure what app I was on. I've been scrolling through youtube shorts and randomly you started popping up on mine and I was like, ... did I open twitch stories or something???
how nice, you can open those without Elegy in TP /silly
@gothiczelda it works best with penne pasta with a lil garlic celery and onions
oh! fact about tomato plants: you can make a new one off of the sucklings you prune off of the big plant. Thus if you ever want multiple tomato plants for a season, grow one a little early and then transplant some of the first sucklings you get
goodness i love the epicness of this fight
My ears were not working cause I heard "Dong Rod" and thought isn't that redundant?
I know TOT is bad but it's such a cool casual dungeon
I'm now working on growing a suckling off of one of our giant tomato plants that is like, 6 feet tall
it has no right being that big
Lets take our runnies to the skies.
Just harness the power of GIGAFRIENDS and you won't have to pee
Tonight will be no veggies but instead rice, eggs and thinly sliced beef
curse me and my desire and likes for things its just mindblowing to me that my fave fight gets skipped
in mm its Dracula but unfortunately u can get lights in not 1 location but 4
so boss key is moot and pointless
Phantom I keep bricking in every duel I'm in
I'm trying to destiny draw and it's not working PepeHands
If I was stronger my deck would respond to me
Like how it feels is when I'm already winning, I'll basically just instantly draw Exodia, but when I just need one card to at least pretend to put up a fight, I draw winged kuriboh except I can't summon it
Like I don't even wanna win. I just want it to not be a literal pass and lose
wait are you actually playing Yugioh Zeli? I thought you were playing Nier but I had no idea about the game at all
... Who said I was playing Nier? LUL
You know this is my own fault getting up to have a snack and coming back without reading what happened in between
So, in casuals I play Utopia/Zexal or more recently Salamangreats. Right now I'm doing the Synchro Cup challenge which means the extra deck only has Synchros, and that I'm played the Clear Wing/Speedroid loaner but I'm trying the Red Dragon Archfiend deck
meanwhile i play slifer the sky dragon, in attack mode
Actually I would die to that Glubbers
of course you would, it's slifer, the sky dragon
(i never cared about yugioh after GX my statements are all dated)
Ok my opponent might just be stupid
He literally could have negated my entire turn and he's just letting me cook
oh zeli you're playing nier now?
Are you trolling me or Amish? LUL
i don't think many things i say should be taken at face value
do you not have a cue there?
let me pull up TP so i don't just miss something off memory
Ok, I can *maybe* come back from this
but iirc: hold L + Up, as you see the arena border spawn, start stabbing. that'll hit the first one. then, when zant teleports away, turn away and start slashing, then the 4th hit you target before the slash, so link turns and hits him, then the third one, you just immediately start a quick charge spin
Ok I just noticed 2 improvements I need to make to this deck
It needs to win more and lose less
Winning more and losing less would be very helpful for this deck tho
Kinda fixes all the problems I have with it
That they can go bad Sadge
Good luck on the end NODDERS
phantom, should i start playing ptcg
It's very expensive with a lot of scalpers around too
yeah it seems like its a constant thing
sometimes less, given they're doing specialty sets
yeah i'm just trying to find more irl things to go and do
prereleases are a lot of fun tho
the drafts are a good time
i could go back to rock climbing but i would want something else too
@TheGlubbers May I interest u in our lord and savior climbing Mount Celeste /notsrs
@FatPidgeyBirb i played celeste years ago
I say go to a prerelease and build a deck/play with it there
drafts are so fun, I've won some drafts back in DPPT era
having a hell of a poker face helps
Show me one and I'll show you
@Amishman19 Shive it up your asshole
@SwiftPichu_ But that's not you showing SadgeBusiness
@Amishman19 It's a step by step tutorial
finally, we are free to wear clothes again
great 😌 job on the sub 5!
Seeing you get this time after what happened with Stalord KEKW
let me go like it on Bluesky WICKED
do i have to vote? Hmm
I'm picking ww to save the trouble
And I can assume the other 3
OK and I also know who's doing Z1
run it back new poll :^)
i know who 1 of the tp is
OK nvm thought it was ice
was playing X4. This shit's okay, at best
You're gonna raid Glubbers aren't you
It's almost like we knew it was that slut
gn folks! GG again and ty for the stream Phantom!
who could have seen this coming
there’s no more 1st in stock lol
I'll go 2, 4, 6, 7
how did that happen, you spain your ankle?
Hmm, maybe 1, 3, 5, 7
Maybe the settings aren't ass and you're ass
the panel hints throw me off so much
i'm nice and early hello cozii
I'm ammending my picks to 2, 3, 5, 7
i watched the ridiculous tp rando you uploaded, was very entertaining pyraSip
i can't believe my advice of "think of a bad idea" paid off lmao
cause any other seed going to that cliff would be a terrible idea lmao
you'll prolly be like 1 item away in by 30 min then spend the next hour looking for the last item.
almost done with async then I can finally update to 0.6.3
paper mario just need tubba keys and a fortress key, minish needs 2 small keys and a big key, and emerald just needs flash and stone badge for regi hunt
oh no sushie was left in the desert
See Sushi has been more yellow
Without needing to burn time on timing block hits
i swear that the hardest move to block
there was an ad you must have survived the dark koopas
I just don’t care about goombario but I like watching people hate him
Answer was do Chapter 7 scaled Junior
we really do just steal our kingdoms mailman and have him follow us
When being right is so wrong
this is the only point when kooper matters battle wise
Geez Chapter 7 didn't have to go so hard
Both flying turtles in a shell
Clear Chapter 7 Chapter 7 scaled as your first chapter
Chapter 7 scaled first chapter is normal though WAT
Wait...gimme a second, trying to find that HUH cat
we still have two more it’s fine
At least you got variety's name correct
Yeah I think a percentage based COL adjustment is very fair NODDERS
punkin thinks I’m just convenient :(
am I more than just convenient :(
i don't think you're *just* convenient
You're convenient *in a variety of ways*
Were you going to say "There's a variety of reasons" @Phantom5800 ?
I have heard every variety joke on the planet
such a wide variety of puns
i love variety, they are the spice of life
@a_variety_pack fine, how many PACK jokes have you heard hm?
oh i guess im here now phanto274GL potentially mean rando
haven’t heard a lot of a joke’s tho
i'd think of one but i'm not funny
RARRRRR  Lurks under the box watchin phanto274Lurk
wonder how many times THAT person has heard THAT joke
I know you answered this before but now I’m talking notes: what is go mode again?
your commentary sounds fine bro do you even need me
Just don't be in go mode
I don’t play randomizers so I’ve never really understood the  appeal of actually beating the game after go mode is achieved
@a_variety_pack the same reason you don't end timer after beating the final bioshock infinite fight in runs
its the same as finishing a speedrun
well I didn’t say why it’s not required
Funny how this shop sells a usable hammer with the dusty one
"go mode" can also vary from game to game and doesn't mean beating the game plays out the same each time
It did but it was quiet
robbing your commentator, bold play i like it
have I really not been here the same time as Glubbers
yeah, as per usual, off a joke
no variety i've known phantom for a bit over a year
you had a title about "your favorite google font" and his answer wasn't a google font
oh that is a bad answer
same as in real life tbh
Oh so Phantom. I found an interesting project I wish I could work on. It's a $1700 portable solar hand truck
I was stung by a wasp in 10th grade. Wouldn't recommend
i was stung in the face when i was i think 2
It stores up to 5.12 kWh and can output up to 5000W
Sure @a_variety_pack but only if you say please
I was just gonna say I need to go back to doing streams where Im punished if I swear because I’ve gotten too comfortable
why do you have to phrase it that way
monkaS In what way are you being punished
i don't think that counts as SocialSkills
hello i didnt say it was??
nimbus, I just consider everything where someone discusses their stream in someone else’s stream like socialskills derivative
Like are we talking swear jar or mob hit death squad @a_variety_pack
Ok that's probably a better idea
AI has replaced most mobster jobs anyway
OI, Colorado was right there, you could have delivered that NotLikeThis
dirt? I didn’t know I was in the game
plenty of packed dirt to go around
why do the pizzicato parts in the overworld track sound like mystery dungeon
it's not bad routing it's just creative
thanks i practiced for a long time Prayge
But this solar handtruck does seem like a reasonable DIY set up
Yeah I found a DIY solar hand truck that's $1700. It has a 5.12 kWh battery, and a 5000W output inverter
And then you can add panels as appropriate
yo I got like 400 of my deposit back?
maybe I will fly snail out to commentate for me
hp was the brand of my first laptop too
were you doing 99*2 because that’s not 189
it's 99 + 30 * 3
your tone of voice sometimes changes when you commentate, it is very interesting
is it narcissistic to say I kinda like mine
when i think about or hear my own voice i want to shove nails into my ears because it would sound more pleasant
i wouldn't call that narcissistic no
watermarking a glorp emote is crazy
just equip a spike shield duh
I enjoy the capslock "NO", very aggressive
I never use shift I always use capslock for capital letters. IDK if this makes me a psycho or not...
altho tbh I like the Gale version better. But that might just be cause I've played that game like 50 times at this point LUL
yeah I like miror b's XD theme more catJAMMER
yeah i fat finger and didn't care KEKW
cause you hear them all the goddamn time?
The battle music in this game is so good
The Renoir 1 fight theme is the best IMO
or well actual 1 not the auto-fight idk what that theme is.
superboss is very fun... to 1 shot smilers
it's also the theme that's used in the trailer if you've seen that.
Well the video that plays when you open up the Steam page LUL so I assume that's the trailer
i seen a little gameplay and said meh looks alright and then all my gacha streamer started playing it
the song is Une Vie a t'amier
it is 11 min tho LUL
I bet some random lurker voted NO at the last second. Just a guess though.
Astro Bot 2 songs i lstened to for the 1 hr challenge Boy and Crash Site Landing.
longest video game song in my playlist is 11:03
longest song is either Monster Hunter or Final Fantasy
Longest non-video game song I have is 14:42
hmm i wonder where this from Kappa
shortest non-video game song I have is 2 seconds LUL
only 1 more month until the trails in the sky remake come out widehypeE
it's technically 7 seconds on Spotify but there's like 5 seconds of dead air at the end LUL
@Darkness3827 This is War Or Beyonces Videos that are also songs.
shortest song this decade i wish was longer was david guetta take on Night at the Broxbury
Should I join so you lose points Kappa?
Baby Dont Hurt me is what its called
You lost to Luey in his first race ever Kappa
avarie1GL urooglLucky phanto274GL on the race!
Oh okay. I went to shower
You DNF'd cus you forgot to buy an item in a shop lol
@stavros12c34anenoglou This reminds me of uh...the cheerleaders in warioware
Every partner in toad town already damn
Thank God I'm not the only one who does that
Hey GL on the race buddy. Imma lurk in the background terragStalZone evo17Hiyo
It's just two newbies and Levias right?
Stream lagged, any progression on Merlow?
I feel like there rarely is
no way its gonna be 123
I skip it pretty much 100% of the time and have yet to be punished for it
Bruh I get surprised every time
Nice of Bombette to remember that her shoes actually belong to you
Wait why is the victory jingle different lol
Run is invalid if you don't grab it tho
You're almost go mode for chapter 2 tho
that should count as a chapter completion imo
In last week's race I found go mode for every chapter except 5, which needed one hammer upgrade
Rigby actually found it cus he dipped chapter 1 and it was there lol
I'm gonna start skipping this boo ring
Phantom on their way to donate points to Levias Kappa
how was it not? i thought i saw boots sticking thru the enemy
I go entirely off vibes tbh
knowing it’s an audio cue is very nice actually I never knew where it was
I have a VTuber friend who plays the blitz seeds casually and she has 100% blocks on dark koopas I assume because she is a witch
i think...i don't want to meet Pink's social group
Do you really want to go up the mountain tho?
It's really only portrait you'd want to find right?
2 HP ice piranhas are cursed
Or just find your bucket here
ask and you shall receive ig LUL
Why is 1 scale monstar the only one with vanilla HP?
I don't even remember the last time I fought him lol
Also if you don't have portrait you can't actually complete the chapter
Hey Phantom!  Hope your day, and the stream are going well!
I'm taking psychic damage from this
I was typing marigold and then twitch sent it without my permission. Rude
Are you doing all 7 chapters?
Cool!  Always awesome to watch a pro!  :D
Bugs is my favorite paper Mario setting
I mean All Dungeon Entrances ARE shuffled LUL
i must be off gl phantom, bye chat <3
Still 0 fused shadows tho :(
damn now we gotta discuss if LJA’s should be allowed this season monadoYesHoney
Prologue skipped but phantom still went there smhing my head
I mean prologue is kinda skipped cause you don't have to fight Goomba King.
20 coins in Bowser castle shop tho
Nice!  I need to figure out the setting to get by the puzzle games LUL
Maybe I never knew LUL.  But, I always played the puzzle games in world 7 (with Bombette and the ones with Kooper).  Chances are I never knew, though
He spends every turn healing actually
Crystal King has all the best recolors tbh
I always get the ugly colors... especially when I play vs. the Goomba King LUL
Not beating chapter 2? Smh my head
Can you do the no watt strat?
It would be better if you didn't still have to beat 3 chapters one of which is up crystal mountain lol
Putting double dip and triple dip on should give you quadruple dip
8 scale, added just last week you missed it
Can't believe you just straight up stole Goombaria's doll
I mean she is related to Goombario so she had it coming
He doesn't need that he can just parakarry clip in if he needs anything in there
the rare fabled Harry Karry skip Kappa
standard 4 spirits then for race seed?
You did play it kinda slowly tbh, did moles, did pit
But I feel like the other 3 are also the types to do those fights and much slower
If luey ever played league races the way he does casual blitz seeds he'd be unbeatable
you were not i don't think we did comms together
and 90% of the time it works out for no reason
he set that PB 2 days after setting his previous PB of 1:18 lol
alright so what's people's beef with the settings this time
like casual Luey is legitimately unbeatable
my beef is that Store Room Skip isn't legal Kappa
okay let's just make it overworld coins
I don't want to do chapter 4 all the time
As long as we yeet panels, I'm okay
oh wait there's hints on them right
Drownin is asyncing this race but he started like 30 minutes ago, i wonder why he didn't just join
Muppets moment: Moving, right alooooong ♪
why is this randomized im so confused NotLikeThis
is there an optimal path through desert with multicoin blocks added? I seem to recall something being in the rando discord but can't find it now of course
how much time do you think dungeon shuffle adds on average?
leveling on hallway is based and fair
Extra bike outing do be done
and just in time for the finale stav
Just don't get an ad EZ
very true 😔 ads more like bads
Luey would have left on Damage Dodge and somehow still gotten Peril
imagine hating relying on luck when you play this game fatpidSip
I would if i knew how
Levias is on the way to beat 6 in 7
honestly Drownin is the closest to your pace rn
"I'm not surprised when I win" -Phantom
When do we get the new emo tracker package pushed ooc?
red key was behind dark koopas
palace key was in flower fields i think
the thing about vanilla crystal palace is it's rare to have to go in without go mode, with dungeon shuffle it will be much more common
also could have just been on like, 8th Cheato item
oh no, Drownin never went into winding path, he doesn't have water
how do i always get the best timing yugioh sounds KEKW
i did 1:36 on last weeks race but my 2 practice seeds before that were both 1:50s
sometimes the logic be like that
do you remember your seed where you had the quad dip into tubbas?
This is a Paper Mario randomizer?
I've only done 3 seeds and all 3 had chapter 7 in logic
petition to remove chapter 7(but also guarantee ultra boots)
The End? DansGame I just got here
chapter 3 with dungeon shuffle slows you down a bit imo
3 and 7 have always been the slowest chapters tho
brb going to youtube to comment "Nah i'd win"
I've heard like 200 hours of this
if drownin hadn't missed Mystic Water i think he actually could have gotten extremely close to your time tbh
you were wondering where the hammer upgrades were
I went up the shiver peaks thinking I didnt have star stone so after shrooming i had to go back up for snowmans gift
also game giving all ruins stones had me doubting lol
then i found boots in mansion... "okay i was right
i went back in my on stream one time to check chapters when i got go mode for 4 in like 10 minutes out of logic
i do want more of the really simple tricks
a lot of tricks are like "Practice for 2 minutes and you've got it"
I agree with that, might as well just play do all the tricks if it gets too ridiculous
technically you can't beat 5 with JUST laki(you need a way in as well Kappa )
no i mean into chapter 5
super boots method is the funny one i like that one the most
i do think what we do or dont allow is really weird tho
Drak fighting me on Yellow Berry skip as if yellow berry is a hard required item to beat chapter 6
shoutouts to Drownin's seed he sent me where i was doing 3 damage with a partner and 4 damage with Mario for final Kappa
(i actually just spammed items and star storm and didn't have that much trouble)
Buys what he needs and just throws them back in the shop keepers face haha
i mean that's sort of the expected end of randomizer races tho right?
Luey doesn't go THAT insane imo
99% of gamblers quit before they win a randomizer race
ok but what is your opinion on skipping left side sewers when 2 isn't in logic? Like i tend to avoid it as long as im not bottlenecked into it
7 if you have ultra hammer
i like doing Dark Koopas for the big hit of exp
oh yeah the big asterisk is "must be 1 turn fights"
it's a lot less reasonable for 1 check tho imo
oh i didn't do it last season i definitely just mean with coin blocks
I also tend to skip first 2 checks of forever forest tho
beep to the bop greeky stav never say sorry
it's not hard to go back for them if you need them either
also, are these the season 5 settings?
it's definitely tubbas cus this is a BabyRage seed
I really sorry, I had to check something and mute the volume. Did you say this was S5 settings?
what if you need exactly 1 HP tho?
I'm glad that my times have gone substantially lower PrideUwu
my movement is trash though LOL
hey now, there was 7 coins
6 and 1 is still useable tho
3 star pieces for the 3 star pieces in Merlow's rewards
frying pan? more like CRYING PAN phanto274Cry
also I'm not sure I like these icons that show up to determine items
maybe it's just me being an old person LOL
"Well back in season 0..." ohheyi30Hehe
whats the benifit of eatring the shroom over dying and using it ? times save?
If I knew that was the possibility and was paying attention enough, I def would PrideLaugh
i would have simply ate the dried shroom Kappa
Oh yeah peril badges , make sense
so what's the wincon for these settings
I really need to get better at that too, getting in peril on purpose more. Just scared though ohheyi30Cry
also GL for the rest of the run!
so 4 specific chapters and chapter 8
I can imagine some truly obscene garbage happening if the race rules were just "anything goes no ACE"
required early whale to unlock the first non-goombario partner
oh! also, is it balanced BP/FP or full shuffle?
i got so many 1 BP Power Plus
it's great when you get a 1BP PP, but then Power Bounce and D-Down Jump is like 7-8 and you're screwed PrideLaugh
I mean fine, I'll do coin/panelsanity and deal, but full random BP/FP? nahhhhhhhhh
so what do the numbers in the top row mean
and the "do not" signs mean the chapter isn't required?
i like the unique icons for the chapters being npcs instead of the star spirits
I'd def like to try that
trying to think of some funny locations for that
i can see that leading to some dog shit final bowser fights KEKW
wait how many rip cheato checks do you actually have to consider
why is that tree specifically impossible to hit tho?
what sort of nonsense cooks are you running with 5 repel gels
are you trying to do all damage to bowser in 1 turn
I thought they only had like 2 repel gels at that point in the route
no one could convince me to go back to running this game unless they found a way to skip final bowser lol
I think a lot of all cards runners straight up just don't skip bow
ACE isn't real stop gaslighting me
final bowser the best part tho Kappa
I think it was in the context of a marathon
simply do glitchless if you want to get bow
is it not a valid category
100% should make you end at level 27
oh do they do the all cards routing to downgrade hammer to do chapter 2 fast
that doesn't make a lick of sense to me phanto274Thonk
i don't speedrun and i agree that stupid
I kinda stopped paying attention and running when I still felt like I started the whole cause on the WiiU stuff
Yorkin this a emote HUH i love it
Hope u had a great strim raiders
this is a bonus pape rando
yeah i have that on too
I did not know that was a setting
Do I go to the gym or do I play Shrek 2 for the GameCube Hmm
play shrek 2 for the gamecube
I like the way you think tiger NODDERS
anyone says gym is getting ban Kappa
poll is missing a "NO" option that I can vote at last second.
im gonna go listen to slipknot and pretend i'm 13 again
Perfect time for me to join.
"I'm just going to squirt when it catches fire."
A 50/50 on no sleep so far monkaS
They say if you decide to watch Shrek 2 instead of going to the gym, you turn into Shrek
well then you turn into Shrek 2 LMAO
one of these screen transitions is going to take us to Mt Rugged so we can hear those sweet, sweet claves workin overtime, right?
dang, that's what I get for being an hour late.
I was busy prepping to refinish my hardwood floors.
GG on buying a house @461weavile
apparently I got gifted a sub to Andy.
might as well use the emotes while I can.
following the rules is for DICKS
nah, who needs a ruins key
new fusion rando hit stable version, and it's pretty fun
that sounds like a good time. maybe i'll have to try it soon.
i'm doing my second run of it rn, just offline
i appreciate that major items actually have the graphics now, and not just a question mark
my favorite part so far is that security locks are randomized
it forced me to fight a midgame boss to open lock 1
@gbhweegee my first fusion rando lock lv1 were insanely deep into the seed it was a pain getting around the map lol
i'm stuck searching for lock level 3
security lock 3 was behind screw attack
if only everdrive had auto tracking
a while back I asked austin about paper mario AP everdrive implementation, and he said it would require a ton of extra help and i cant see icebound dedicating time like that just for AP with a setup only a dozen of people would use if that
but yeah, now that this is a thing for fusion, i might come back to fusion rando streams
honestly, I just want a rating system enabled. If I'm doing bad, it just says, "Wow you fucking suck. You should stop playing" and then I'll cry and stop
i got about 13 minutes after you
and levias got a sub 2
blue dress is a nice color
I find it funny how people react saying "How can Kirby air riders direct be 45 minutes?" Me: have you never seen a sakurai presents for a single smash character release?
this isn't a racing game, right, it has a story?
I expect it to start with "What is kirby air ride?" Then he talks about the original game LUL
i'm considering not watching to avoid spoilers.
well yeah, GCN had to restart development and was finished in 3 and a half months. Granted level were done tho
Sakurai talked about it on his youtube channel
perhaps they learned from that and that's why prime 4 has been in development for 200 years now.
I really like that mode though PrideLaugh
The End? DansGame I just got here
just end it and do a new 1 Kappa
mine just went down another 60 bucks
ice has some problem with the steel city?
it's an ass city to travel too
you have a gameboy, don't you?
i know i know. living an hour and a half from it does not affect me very much
except when i have to go to the dr
id live in the city in the sky
I’d do something else in a dungeon if you know what I mean
so when the anime horse girls racing stream Kappa
of course, I mean enjoy a nice meal
I’ve seen some decked out dungeons in my day
and you call yourself from the pnw with sweet tea?
don’t bother coming to pax mf
when I make tea at home?
green, lemon ginger, or English breakfast
Good luck! (gonna lurk because I'm running as well)
Walking + lurking + walking on treadmill
you try rolling through a gate >:(
you don’t want access to irl back in time?
Hmm does truck kun  isekai me
I just realized we running on the same day for sdat lmao
Im def checking out ur run cuz pape glitchless is dope
Speaking of SDAT this ain't Pap Mar.
So far good. I might go back to any% but I was focusing on 120 and pbd by like 7 mins so I think im good there HA
Been on PB pace like 3 times so could see a PB tbh
Its Pap Mar that is the start
Galaxy is just a game that has a lot of PB potential
I have big timesaves in lategame but I wont be dissapointed
im more worried about ge2 skip failing
anyways i just got here but i think imma nap
ge2 skip is the equivalent of blue house skip but not as bad
NO LINK DONT KILL THE GOAT
Just 15 minutes feels like alot lol
It's just walking so it has no side bars also it caps a 4mph
I went with a budget model first
RAR lurk under the box phanto274Lurk phanto274Lurk
Also no assembly was very appealing
Can you verify something about your retrotink?
If it's a splitter it should
I have ps3 games I'd like to eventually play but getting behind the TV is annoying
Thought it'd be the other way
Or i could run component thru retrotink for ps3
And even then 1080p was for some games
I think the last rac main game was 1080
Do you have any opinions on retrotink 4K CE? it's $475
I'm excited for you to go to PAX next week too
All 4 one I never cared
i only played the 2 newer 1
Easier to just call it the remake
ive only played the PS4 remake based on the movie
You're missing the good shit tiger
when would be the TP equivalent to end of first cycle
therre is a list of differences including hardware differences listed on the site
i think my nso SNES controller dpad is breaking down
No rotation support, input width limitations, Linear motion-adaptive de-interlacing only without advanced sensitivity controls, No support for inverse 3:2 to de-interlace telecine content or to reconstruct 24 fps sources from 60i and 60p, No enhanced S-video support, Reduced color depth for the banner image from 11 to 6 bits and a few other things
and surely that S video is still better than my 2X pro?
This just keeps getting worse, beautiful
i am in a state of existence (not saying this in a bad way)
The ellipses makes it funnier I feel like
Why did Banjo wear cosplay to Mayahem Temple? Becuase he thought it was Anime Ahem Temple. Cheer100
i am a little sad its Tales of Xillia getting a remastered and not abyss Sadge
that was my first tales game
Never played them so I'm an ignorant
tales of the abyss is my fav and its only on ps2 and 3ds Sadge
*turns around, sees PS3 Xillia collectors edititon box* LUL
Could be worse, could have cotton eye joe
Someone actually posted the lyrics to me one day and I was stuck with that the whole day, banjo included
Xillia is the only one ive beaten
played alot of graces f tho
i have beat most of them
is beseria good? i dropped after zesteria
velvet is such a good mc too
i was surprised to learn the in graces f Cheria is voiced by Laura Bailey
@Axl_SR the extra voice stuff in graces remastered she have a different va just some skits and stuff
Variety no run is safe from goats
Unless it's hold a cat or whatever it is
no but it feels like it's ass
what specifically does iron boots let you do
For link it's fine but Bo, I'm sorry that shit is a diaper
you have way more time to save than that
Do I own or rent the dungeon?
The other exciting thing for me is Xillia drops 2 days before my birthday
Unless the dungeon was Snowpeak Ruins. In which case for being in ruins they seemed to have a decent place. The neighbors mostly just mind themselves
They clearly had access to important things like Ordon Cheese
gta 6 come out 3 days before my birthday
do i watch or play myself?
You know. Variety has a point
I love that GTA got delayed til nexxt year just so it can take "most aticipated game of the year" at the game awards LUL
I remember glub doing safe bit but being so tilted he also failed it
imagine running a game where rolling 30 times requires a comment on how good it was
So wait variety is it running a game or rolling a game?
Dashing sounds more like running a game
i'm a fan of 19 69's.
1969 was the first moon landing
What kind of dungeons are we limited to?
okay the second one was not his fault
It was also the inauguration of President Nixon
It was also the first flight of the Boeing 747
reset to Morpheel, don't have time for more sadly
you don't do the hyperactive epona thing in ad? i don't remember
I’m going to say I’ll live in Deepwood Shrine
free jello is a big selling point
i guess my feet fit in there
again, free jello is a big selling point
I am so glad we don’t have slugs
1969 was the first airing of the Scooby Doo Franchise
i think so? not sure tho lol
you must have had banana slugs
they're not common that's for sure
Apparently a ton of mainstream actors were born in 1969 as well
at that point might as well make it so you can do something on your commute
I used to read on my commute too. Then I realized if I don't read, I don't have to stop at the sign
you don’t ready while you boot up stream?
And I can go as fast as I want
Smh there’s 5 minutes a day
at least you didn't do a mondo and delete your savefile from muscle memory
he did that once in ttyd KEKW
so he was reloading the savefile because you have to do it to avoid a softlock
its funny because he was saying "this run is pretty good" and then he deleted the savefile KEKW
because ttyd normally you don't return to title screen during a run unless it dies KEKW
i know for a fact there's an emote of this puzzle....
it was ok, i dont like this 100% IL as much, kind of annoying rng with ook + walltulas + 2 hand grabs
You dont like playing ever match with 200+ ping???
watch out the melee crowd is on the way
melee boss but sb1 is top tier
mario was so fun to use in smash 4 because I could make my friends mad by simply grabbing them once and dealing 50% for free
one day in college i tried to impress a dude seeing him play a modded melee
Yup that sounds like smash 4
"i will take pride in making a young kid cry"
That game was high key toxic KEKW
i knew it was falcon but like...i was nervous and being a teenage girl again xD
i could feel my face go red
How did i guess that right
gotta learn how to do these jumps..
i'm cringe and i play samus in every game even if she sucks
she's decent in melee and pretty good in ult
am I crazy to say snow peak the best dungeon in this game
this is the first time i've seen you clear forest temple boss btw because i kept leaving
well there are times i pass out midway because i'm always sleepy
bruh wait how tf u got the master sword in the forest temple
so much but you're far in
post pb run oh no its cursed
I’ve never seen such sweaty strats I only played this game normally
youre so sweaty at this game
money made aside do you prefer prerolls or midrolls as a viewer
prerolls because i watch people for long usually
back but uh...imma be honest about that ad. if i see a glowing light spring out of my coke...i wont act happy surprised...
wow phantom thinks i'm 400 pounds
i was gonna say 5 6
shoutout to glubber picture with etchy
oh yeah i forgot about that lol
bro will waste an hour trying to get normal BiT but not learn the karg clip
why is my message still pinned
idk why i like sassing regulars in chat
he said he turned off his brain and isn't gonna think about it lol
don't be lolz it was hilarious
you could say that it... sucks.. ahaha.... shiruLeave
i laughed too much and now my mouth hurts
i didn't say it was a job
is babysitting considered work if not being paid?
maybe i should become a professional babysitter
What did I just come back to?
wait it's your birthday or is it the bot bday?
i'm sorry for being a degenerate okay
a fellow degenerate?? you should totally join discord lol
Of all of the doctorate level degrees you could have gotten
when you think about it tbh...we're all degens to a certain degree
@AnniLyn2 no, i'm a degen *with* a certain degree
She could have gotten an MD, a JD, DBA
i mean...you got naughty and then it increases to crimes against humanity degen
@a_variety_pack Ok I liked that come back so I forgive you
I have a degen schedule but probably the least degen personality
There's a reason I very commonly duck out of most of these channels
Meanwhile I just talk about solar hand truck and no one talks to me Sadge
i just noticed you're wearing a sleeveless shirt
as I told Glubbers the other day
I spent a bunch of time analyzing any investment I've made or am considering involving electricity and coincidentally the time to break even money wise is 7 years LUL
solar hand truck, e-bike, new computer, etc.
@a_variety_pack did you like the summer or just didn't want 20?
i just saw the pin lol
But he was chatting elsewhere not long ago
i'm gonna get a bad reputation
i just think it's funny okay
Bad reputation came out in 1980
yeah but don't worry i can cover you with worse stuff you don't wanna hear
I'm sure you have a variety of reputations
It's okay you can ban me now
i have heard every variety joke in existence at this point
She's heard a variety of variety jokes 4Head
Ok I'm really sorry about that @a_variety_pack
i mean you got the variety pack so it's expected
To be fair didn't I make a pack pun about variety earlier?
i just made a combo lolz
I've been on call and being woken up at 3AM so Sadge
Where did he even move to?
I'm only on call every 10 weeks or so
@Zeliversal how do i read that? Sadge. is it like sage or sad-j?
i mean i know it's an emote but like...yeah
I've heard Sad - gee, Sad-j, Sad - guh
good chance that doesn't happen on this run tho
someone remind me to sub next month before i forget and run out of money
screw it. we'll do it live
phan...what kind of music are you into? i'm curious
i think you should probably focus on this first lol
wait what i just got back
He's going to kill the run and asked what he should do instead
i'll hop on vc and you teach me everything there is to know about pmr
dude that's like the best way to play games. original controller and overuse
aw the buttons are just indented
I win the smartass award Gladge
am i remixing the black and red mario in my head?
Yeah cuz i've played the game
Not all the songs are on spotify for some reason
I also have a lot of sonic music on my spotify LUL
I'm guessing that's inputs per second
this extraction is going to give me diabestus
i'll just need you to screenshare
I just rage quit doing a practice seed
literally forced normal boots forest jr. troopa fight
Lemme guess @a_variety_pack is commentating a pape rando run at PAX
most people would be around lv20 i think
there is exactly nothing in the entire game goombario is required for
not allowing sushi glitch for peak rando papeHands
its a bit too technical by definition but its kinda fair
geometry climbing is a slippery slope
variety why did you do it
i'm gonna say now...i can barely hear you both but it's not you guys. i have to have my volume down so i don't break my monitor speakers
my jaws hurt too much for my headphones
oh i'm okay Sammy...my gums still hurt. i might've messed something up while streaming since i was laughing too much
A finality pack quick on variety
Awwww is that why your gums hurt? Because of laughing
i wanna play video games rn
imma go ahead and play some silent mario party 2 lolz see you guys next stream!
that kid is the equivalent to a pokemon rival
annoying and won't leave you alone
first real enemy you fight, like a pokemon rival. annoying and irrelevant to the plot, like a pokemon rival.
My internet connection dropped when I joined your stream last time
show sushi glitch for the fans
here avp my fave pape emote
so why do some of the partners have ? in their name
oh so they still show up in the menu
some events forcibly take out partners
It's so the game doesn't freak when they aren't there for certain cutscenes
does goombario do literally anything in these settings
does goombario do anything in any settings
chapter 5, highlights of this game's programming
is it at all similar to ttyd's goombella buffer
so goombario is useful at making another partner useful
so just how much does lakilester open up in glitch logic lol
i mean surely clippy alone does a lot of things
sushi open up a lot too :)
this is my fave boss avp btw
you mean his next turn he will puff
after he huffed the previous turn
huff n puff is hardcoded to take zero damage from watt right
didn't remember if zap tap was coded differently or not
what is the omega key btw
no the one that's lowercase omega
or is that just a W
remake should let you just kill rosie
so are there any other spots than that corner of toad town and in shiver city where you can just straight up swim on land due to bad geometry
it lets you clone the seed in forever forest
you can just ignore most collisions
would you be able to do the same setup to clone like a koopa bros fortress key that randomly rolled onto the vanilla forest seed location
or does something about the randomizer mess that up
same setup as in all cards seed dupe
iirc all of the "duplicate" badges are listed as separate badges that are just identical right
What a present, cake and a new set of shoes and a new house key
really don't want to fight blooper huh
this looks really EZ is it?
it's always been amazing to me that chapter 7 doesn't have a way to enter it early
like the one part of it they coded properly was getting into it
OH shoot , i thought it was a past thing that happened not a avp current thing that is happening my bad xD
Not without a frying pan and some breadcrumbing
telling him to do what he's supposed to do while throwing him into the void is crazy work
never noticed that thing on his head until now
he had a light on his head like an angler fish lmfao
Tomorrow I'll probably go out for some Yu-Gi-Oh cards
I'm trying to finish a deck
are you a swag hammer enthusiast
and now if you go back egg is frozen to death FeelsOkayMan
the ice palace amazed me as a kid
and for some reason you can destroy the rocks
and then they lick you if there's no more rocks lmfao
i like that we just call this sushie glitch
some ppl at my old work wore that badge proudly , jsut double dipping in the hummus at events
if you get goombario you have to reset the seed
you can tell who was the early game favorite among the devs
but bombette is REALLY good at what she does
Also shell shot literally cannot miss the final boss
fucking fire shell kills me, why does he just combust into flames randomly
i mean , kooper being dissapointing is also like lore accurate
hey kooper outside of battle is useful
laki is also straight ass but he looks cool so i love him
i think a wii runner has a 1:37/36 tho
oh boy i love 30% for the run to live
yeah him, 1:37:06 is his pb
honestly I think in terms of in battle ability
iirc he was close many times but got shit on cuz the game is bad
the worst like 4 partners really aren’t that diffeeent
like is parakarry really significantly better or worse at combat than lake
me when I stretch my toe the wrong way
hopefully it's not a repetitive stress injury
those are a fast track to not gaming
yeah that'll probably just heal by itself
it does if you play mario odyssey min caps
when it hurts a lot, it hurts a lot
how else are you going to do 2 player CRCs without using your foot on one of the controllers
people meme on final wasting time, but this fucker is the king of that if you dont get a charge badge
yeah CK can take a while
is every song not just an autoscroller
real question is when are you going to run book of mario randomizer
aka regular pape rando with the google translate text
how else am i going to get corporate upgrade 2 in caeau blodaua
sure you COULD do the regular blue house skip setup
but why bother when you have easy mode
at least there is actual water here
granted it's frozen water but that's still more correct than toad town
i cant unsee them as mario grimace
it might be less than that
bow outside of tubba's castle is crazy
why is that only 2 FP
crazy they did it again in the very next game
it gives mario a free turn
tbh 2FP is justified for the boss of chapter 3
is it actually coded as infinite defense
or is it just like 20 defense so you can never damage him
like iirc prologue bowser just gets 1 defense
which is enough but is still really funny
wait does the layout of forever forest get randomized
or is it the same as vanilla at least
well its all the same egg just with different abilities
okay but it would be really funny if it were his brothers you fought throughout the game
i love the entire reason he's after you is because you entered his playground
I do find jr troopa to be mostly just annoying
his post-chapter 5 fight is really funny
with him swimming all the way there and back because he forgot he could fly
doesn't he start with like half hp
yeah feel like you can very easily just do idk like
shoutout to hammer throw almost being viable Sadge
@morpheus080 hey it deals extra damage to chapter 6 monty moles
tubba is just a lil guy
did they really need to scale that down
there are no other star spirits
you feel kinda bad for him etchyLmao
so who is your favorite star spirit
tbh its all you need for the boss
lakilester does enough outside of  battle that i can forgive his combat shortcomings
the koopa bros song is dope though
dizzy shell is actually goated af
this kid loses a lot of runs
wait did his transform get rid of chill out or was that just a coincidence
it feels like 90% in runs tbh
and then he starts doing lightning instead of magic for some fucking reason
cloud nine's chance to work is just straight 50/50 right
Damn, Bowser sucks on the strap? Kinky mf'er
it overrides other stuff like close call or whatever
now you see if mario just set up a substitute
idr how much more damage he does here
is that 15 with or without  blocking
and then it's like 20 in the next fight right
because if it's without blocking that sounds like there are stupid peril setups you can do
except that you can use it without saving a single star spirit smh
15% on turn 3, 75% every turn afterwards
the rest of this game is so good as a speedrun
avp this is the worst final boss ever ganon at alltp is nothing
i was a magnet for this shit only in glitchless, it was really deflating lol
was that two turn 3 shields twice
That was one of the more rude Bowsers I have seen in a long time.
are you running the same settings there as here
oh so you got the only pattern that game over'd you
usually this split before epilogue is 7-8 minutes and over half of it is all cutscenes
50% u beat me to it phantom
would be nice if there were rng manipulation for bowser but alas
all cards and no ace are probably no higher than 40% if i had to guess
it might be the worst fight now cuz you only win with fire lol
lets go king of wasting time
so is 100% the only main category that actually has a semi-consistent final bowser
lightning in a glitchless safe fight is about 10%, but then he's more likely to do it again if he's done it once
chat we gotta thank our special co-host for joining us
how bad is the goombario skip lzs anyway
falling in the lava is in fact a glitch
falling in lava is a glitch limesNoted
most well programmed area in the game
phantom you complaining about glitchless just makes me think of MM glitchless
where it allows some whack stuff but ban other stuff
wait didn't that jump takes literally years to discover
are we going over a route
i love how its "early" but its not a sequence break in any way
i paid justin 100$ to do a glitchless ttyd run with slowgo :)
there’s so much edge case knowledge in this game
more bad ideas: show off early whale at pax
[swiftpichu_] @ It'll be just as shit as my suggestions yes
[swiftpichu_] @ Minute? More like 30s
[rgamer0] @ Yoy! phanto274Wave phanto274Smile iceblueArrive iceblueGL phanto274GL
[nozomup] @ Boy, you sure are THICK
[mirby_studios] @ oh there's the lantern you needed yesterday
[morpheus080] @ so poe gate skip today right
[morpheus080] @ the equivalent to a sub 2:50 now would be like a 2:48 at least i'd imagine
[morpheus080] @ probably, im super low balling it cuz idk the specifics and how much faster it could get
[ilsolaro] @ How many times have u finished it
[morpheus080] @ god i love walking
[mirby_studios] @ bah i want to play something but i don't know what
[mirby_studios] @ i'll be right over
[mirby_studios] @ i think it's like a 6-7 hour drive that gives plenty of time for a run and to cook it mirbysSmug
[mirby_studios] @ actually maddy's parents are taking us to a vegas trip for our birthdays in november so that should be fun. their mom has comped nights to use
[mirby_studios] @ but i had to not giggle every time she mentioned the palazzo cause every time i hear the name of that place i just think kefka mirbysLUL
[mirby_studios] @ that's literally his last name lmao
[hylianlucas] @ what is a tp run without 1827491825 attempts dying before boomerang
[hylianlucas] @ "wym i didnt insta catch the lilypad lightbug??? ima reset..."
[applequeenuwu] @ strugling to sleep sooo lurk in the box time phanto274Lurk
[themasterzelda] @ not sure which npc i am.... maybe hugo? random enemy in the middle of nowhere
[themasterzelda] @ and people hate me Kappa
[themasterzelda] @ have you learned the nrw trick yet? Kappa
[themasterzelda] @ i love how in beest video he just stand there spamming L for 15s
[themasterzelda] @ also if i have to guess the pot clip and the sand walking section will get better setups but it will still be super rng
[themasterzelda] @ the poes are what takes super long in itself
[themasterzelda] @ by that i mean the fights really add to the time
[themasterzelda] @ cutscenes + fight + cutscene
[themasterzelda] @ its like at least 1m30s alone
[themasterzelda] @ back to first cycle Sadge
[themasterzelda] @ this is the grotto alt exit of TP
[themasterzelda] @ hugo is hidden owl
[themasterzelda] @ and lost wood is deku palace
[themasterzelda] @ once you done with it you finaly get to play
[themasterzelda] @ no but puppet rng makes up for it
[themasterzelda] @ its more so with the skullkid fight
[themasterzelda] @ they can be annoying
[themasterzelda] @ oh you never noticed he was literally bringing the new sword
[themasterzelda] @ does that goat have a name
[themasterzelda] @ the one goat that always refuse to cooperate
[themasterzelda] @ isnt that gym cat?
[glennjaamin] @ but can you head faster
[themasterzelda] @ the only part im not sure whats going on is the quicksand and why it needs shield bash or midna charge
[themasterzelda] @ that was my guess
[themasterzelda] @ its funny that you need iron boots
[themasterzelda] @ yea i know but its funny to me
[themasterzelda] @ you also cant beat city without iron boots. and zant
[themasterzelda] @ oh yea zant you can skip if you have zora armor :)
[icebound777] @ jump attack in this game certainly is programmed
[themasterzelda] @ jump attacks are built differnet
[icebound777] @ for the in-dev version?
[icebound777] @ Cool cool. Looking forward to a tracker that is up to date again
[icebound777] @ I find it amusing how stronger the interest in glitch use is on the AP server compared to the pape league
[themasterzelda] @ isn't getting bk'd integral part of the AP experience?
[themasterzelda] @ it does sound familiar
[icebound777] @ Oh, the entrances rework, yea
[icebound777] @ I'm OOTL on that, you'd have to poke JKB or the other guy working on it. Vincent'sSin was it, I think
[icebound777] @ Yeah, having categories would be neat, like how Sunta is laying them out atm
[icebound777] @ Yup, lol, I still have to point Pronyo at it
[icebound777] @ Not much I can help with
[icebound777] @ Wasn't mine either. Then I started work on the rando
[icebound777] @ I get to enjoy the gnu90 c compiler at work. Compared to that the rando is futuristic
[orangeisborange] @ I am 100% the NPC that asks you to do the star challenge and gets mad when you win
[orangeisborange] @ Purlo is his name
[orangeisborange] @ He only says it... once I think?
[icebound777] @ The Gamecube also used PowerPC, right? I think I ran into that during a short look into ttyd
[themasterzelda] @ same architecture you mean right
[themasterzelda] @ so its like new 3ds to 3ds
[icebound777] @ That kinda funny ngl
[themasterzelda] @ where it just downclock the cpu
[themasterzelda] @ im unfamiliar with that term
[icebound777] @ Wasnt there something about a speedrun of a switch1 game being different on switch2 because the emulation accidentally fixed a glitch
[themasterzelda] @ yea gpu is very different
[themasterzelda] @ or wind waker which is a completely different thing
[mirby_studios] @ iirc wasn't it like the game runs too fast now so they can't rely on slowdown for tricks anymore
[mirby_studios] @ i think that was a thing
[themasterzelda] @ it may makes stasis launch harder to do because no slowdown
[themasterzelda] @ this boss is always so sick
[themasterzelda] @ idk ook skip is just cinema
[themasterzelda] @ afaik switch 1 games on switch 2 unless they have a patch specific for it is just dynamic recompilation with a layer for the switch 1 system calls
[themasterzelda] @ which honestly is impressive that it works so well
[mirby_studios] @ i figured out what to play
[mirby_studios] @ i've had a mostly finished run of golden sun the lost age for too long so i'm gonna finish that so i can get that back to mastery on RA
[pierrezebub] @ anyone picked the toilet hand as the NPC they are? KEKW
[pierrezebub] @ i pick the toilet hand for me than
[themasterzelda] @ wait that's cheating its not in tp
[pierrezebub] @ its in the franchise at least
[themasterzelda] @ "that's the second time i failed gate clip today"
[pierrezebub] @ i hope they revisit TPs aesthetic for future zelda games
[pierrezebub] @ yeah , very unlikely unfortunately
[pierrezebub] @ shutt he front door
[pierrezebub] @ no way it is omg. i was like , this game is 10 yo
[pierrezebub] @ gosh the ps1 is gonna be 30 next moth
[blacktiger51] @ monkaS this game is almost 19 years old
[pierrezebub] @ brb ima go pluck some grey hair
[themasterzelda] @ last classic zelda was ALBW
[blacktiger51] @ YEP the last good zelda game Sadge
[pierrezebub] @ @TheMasterZelda id argue Echos of Wisdom
[themasterzelda] @ can't agree to that
[pierrezebub] @ oh EoW was not a great game , but its still ''classical themed''
[themasterzelda] @ i can't get over eow and it being like "look combat is very different" but one of the main power up is literally become link
[blacktiger51] @ if we ever get a new zelda game like the older games i will buy a switch 2
[pierrezebub] @ skyward sword is kinda oot themed
[themasterzelda] @ like i'm genuinely confused why that game even has boss fights
[pierrezebub] @ didint need to add ''on null'' KEKW
[pierrezebub] @ EoW was a great play one time and let it accumulate dust game
[annilyn2] @ What did I miss on this beautiful occasion?
[annilyn2] @ I can see by the 17
[annilyn2] @ How many times did you GO?
[annilyn2] @ So I got a question
[annilyn2] @ But first...how are you today?
[annilyn2] @ Do you like rogue like games?
[annilyn2] @ My friend got me into this game called Vellum lolz up to 4 people in a group
[annilyn2] @ He called it basically a coloring book. Rain describes the look as "rogue like bullet hell"
[annilyn2] @ It reminds me of like a phone game but more advanced and has different colored classes that you can change whenever
[annilyn2] @ I can post pics of it and send to discord next time I play but yeah you got spells and upgrades and fight monsters
[annilyn2] @ I will probably forget lolz
[themasterzelda] @ @AnniLyn2 that doesn't narrow it down much tbh
[annilyn2] @ @TheMasterZelda I know :(
[annilyn2] @ I just got into the game and its really fun
[annilyn2] @ There's also another game you may not like that's in playtest mode on steam called Militioner
[themasterzelda] @ look you can't be worse than me
[themasterzelda] @ stuck for a month routing a romhack and playing literally nothing else
[annilyn2] @ Yeah the grinding seems like it takes a bit but for more spells and customization and unlocking new classes
[themasterzelda] @ my point still stand
[themasterzelda] @ i have a problem
[annilyn2] @ Understandable totally...I was gonna play l4d2 and got tired
[blacktiger51] @ ahh yes left for dead 2 haven't played that game in so long
[annilyn2] @ @blacktiger51 I got back into it and i was angry and wanted to pow pow zombies
[blacktiger51] @ i haven't played it since the xbox 360 days
[annilyn2] @ I don't wanna say the s word instead
[blacktiger51] @ i do own it on pc since it was like 2 bucks KEKW
[lemonmadelemonade] @ Which npc am I? I mean if I had to pick, it'd have to be the first bokoblin you kill
[annilyn2] @ Pick it up again
[themasterzelda] @ that's not a bokoblin
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @AnniLyn2 Pretty sure you don't kill hugo
[themasterzelda] @ also we would never kill hugo
[annilyn2] @ I should read the tp books more
[themasterzelda] @ that one in forest
[annilyn2] @ I called those gremlins
[themasterzelda] @ oh yea the first batch
[annilyn2] @ Don't you kill those in the midst saving... talon? That kid that loves you
[annilyn2] @ Bratty ass bully lolz
[annilyn2] @ 2 before by the outside forest temple
[annilyn2] @ Where the bridge is
[themasterzelda] @ GIGAFRIENDS kill a bunch
[themasterzelda] @ i think you right
[annilyn2] @ Now i gotta play vanilla again
[annilyn2] @ Nancy... she looks more like a Bella
[themasterzelda] @ what's the bubble name
[annilyn2] @ First time I heard you say it... but this is around the time I disappear or pass out
[lemonmadelemonade] @ Kinda why it's my favourite item in this game
[lemonmadelemonade] @ It has a whole ass fairy in it
[lemonmadelemonade] @ And I LOVE fairies
[lemonmadelemonade] @ I meant clawshot, I brainfarted
[annilyn2] @ Hey look...that time I gtg xD brb
[feli_heli] @ i dont think that would be that hard
[a_variety_pack] @ shamrock7 what the fuck is up bro
[a_variety_pack] @ it’s me whenever i’m given a bug
[a_variety_pack] @ i can text fuck
[a_variety_pack] @ it sucks dude i think im way funnier in text
[a_variety_pack] @ there was a joke i was gonna make at the end of hrh resetting but i thought it was too risque
[a_variety_pack] @ i was gonna say daddy bioshock isn’t giving his girl treats
[a_variety_pack] @ how does the game determine which one you hit first
[annilyn2] @ Light fire with fire...and not the fireplace
[annilyn2] @ This twilight makes you annoyed
[a_variety_pack] @ how can i enjoy zelda speedruns more
[annilyn2] @ If I had the time...I'd stream VTP Sunday
[a_variety_pack] @ i have a better question
[a_variety_pack] @ how can YOU enjoy Zelda speedruns more
[feli_heli] @ thats why i do bingo
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ The only 2 ppl that are bringing me back to mm are dobrari and see which category interest jess.
[a_variety_pack] @ play casual hyper light drifter and be on my couch in a week avarie1Yay
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ otherwise Bingo and the rando tourneys are LIT
[a_variety_pack] @ a dick’s milkshake cures all sadness
[annilyn2] @ I think variety is talking about a restaurant
[rgamer0] @ Man I want a milkshake now
[annilyn2] @ I want ice cream now...
[a_variety_pack] @ i wanna milkshake now
[feli_heli] @ ive never heard of this place lmfao
[rgamer0] @ Vanilla, might as well be boring but it works
[feli_heli] @ ive only heard of dicks sporting goods
[annilyn2] @ @a_variety_pack REGULAR ICE CREAM
[a_variety_pack] @ cap hill closer i think
[annilyn2] @ Id ask rain if I can have a vanilla smoothie
[a_variety_pack] @ do you want some incentive to finish this run
[a_variety_pack] @ one (1) milkshake on me if you get at least 3 golds
[annilyn2] @ Had anyone heard from apple?
[annilyn2] @ Aw I missed her
[annilyn2] @ I was just about to go into discord but okay
[a_variety_pack] @ fuck you why did you mention katsu burger when i’m so hungry and vulnerable
[annilyn2] @ She vented what was wrong and I'm usually worried
[a_variety_pack] @ i don’t mind it, and no avarie1Hmm
[annilyn2] @ I've never had any of those except green tea
[a_variety_pack] @ a good teacher knows how to improvise
[annilyn2] @ I'm gonna lurk because rain is in pain
[a_variety_pack] @ i’ve been told it’s very good
[a_variety_pack] @ but idk if it’s true
[annilyn2] @ Not his rod xD
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack I mean typically if people you taught tell you your teaching is good, it means they learned something, therefore making the statement true, so I'm sure you are a great teacher
[a_variety_pack] @ it’s more like i’ve been told by my supervisors that my teaching is good
[a_variety_pack] @ although my course evals are mostly positive
[lemonmadelemonade] @ Not sure how course evaluations work. Care to explain?
[a_variety_pack] @ after i teach a class students basically get to say what they liked and disliked
[a_variety_pack] @ i give them donuts
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack Ah, bribery, the key to everyone's heart
[lemonmadelemonade] @ Wait, doesn't everyone have to fill those out? It was like that in my high school
[a_variety_pack] @ no actually i just offer like a little bit of grading grace on an assignment for fillng it out
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack Ah, success based bribery, the other key to most hearts
[a_variety_pack] @ @lemonmadelemonade i’m not sure but not mandatory in college for sure
[a_variety_pack] @ a maple bar is unequivocally a donut
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ BIGBUGGIES inside my dereks
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack True enough. I still filled them out, since I want the teachers to take feedback and improve
[a_variety_pack] @ i’m watching like a hawk
[waddlemimir] @ variety tp run when?
[a_variety_pack] @ maybe hd but def not sd
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack How big of a difference is there?
[a_variety_pack] @ i run sshd all i know is boko pushing
[a_variety_pack] @ i’ve got that sauce
[themasterzelda] @ oh god i remember watching someone do that trick
[themasterzelda] @ it looks so ass
[themasterzelda] @ he does what he can with what he finds
[lemonmadelemonade] @ It's so his wife can ride him, duh
[a_variety_pack] @ but sex during marriage is immoral
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack Morality is subjective, however I am a supporter of marriage during sex
[fatpidgeybirb] @ a lil formatting prolly woulda been good
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ thanx pidgey was halfway
[a_variety_pack] @ mid fuck: do you now take…
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack Yeah, just starting the ceremony, as they fuck, priest walks into the bedroom
[themasterzelda] @ what kind of ceremony....
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @TheMasterZelda The marriage one, a prerequisite being actively being mid sex
[fatpidgeybirb] @ there was ritualistic and temporary marriage sex often in ancient cultures
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Honestly that makes a lot of sense in context to how older cultures worked
[a_variety_pack] @ guys why do i bring this wherever i go
[a_variety_pack] @ am i the problem
[pierrezebub] @ talking about marriage, heres the ball and chain #laughtrackfromthe50s (its a joke)
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @a_variety_pack Nah, just practical
[a_variety_pack] @ do i want to be known as the twitch whore :(
[themasterzelda] @ "do i want to be known as the twitch whore :( " now THAT is a sentence
[fatpidgeybirb] @ marriage often used to be limited to trial runs (handfasting) or 10 year periods. Forced marriage for a lifetime is a relatively recent development
[fatpidgeybirb] @ that's with western marriage, mind
[lemonmadelemonade] @ Glubbers? A twitch whore? I thought he was a pure victorian boy
[fatpidgeybirb] @ I don't know that much about eastern marriage rituals
[fatpidgeybirb] @ a victorian boy would fucking explode if allowed on twitch for less than 5 minutes
[themasterzelda] @ don't see him on
[a_variety_pack] @ why does yeta have like 7 toes on each foot
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Now that is just silly. Humans don't explode, at most he'd have a stroke
[fatpidgeybirb] @ @lemonmadelemonade horrifying fact, humans are very much capable of explosion and implosion.
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @FatPidgeyBirb How? What is the logic behind it?
[a_variety_pack] @ i do appreciate how yeto walks into this scene and doesn’t assume you beat the shit out his wife
[themasterzelda] @ maybe she's just a girl in a fursuit
[fatpidgeybirb] @ @lemonmadelemonade vaccuums, mostly, I think. If you went out into space without a suit you would quite literally implode in on yourself
[a_variety_pack] @ i guess you did
[fatpidgeybirb] @ enough pressure on earth would do the same
[zeliversal] @ Hello Traveler. Would you like to purchase some items? HeyGuys
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Are you implying the chemical reaction between the victorian kid seeing twitch dot tee vee and his brain trying to comprehend it would cause enough pressure for him to implode?
[zeliversal] @ Hello Traveler. Would you like to purchase some items? HeyGuys
[zeliversal] @ Ok. Come again traveler!
[zeliversal] @ NODDERS A glitchless run would be pretty short
[lemonmadelemonade] @ That spin attach synced perfectly with the end of the game over jingle
[zeliversal] @ There's no glitches so that must mean it takes less time since you have to do less
[zeliversal] @ What if I want you to?
[a_variety_pack] @ goes on sale a lot if you really ever wanted to
[fatpidgeybirb] @ Pape 1 star spirit?
[themasterzelda] @ im a jotwad enthusiast
[zeliversal] @ What about glitchless. No glitches = more faster
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @FatPidgeyBirb WE MUST TEST THAT HYPOTHESIS! Bring me an ample size of victorian children
[themasterzelda] @ they don't want to you see they only rendered half the town
[fatpidgeybirb] @ bet, lemme just invite time travelling. anyone have 27 ocarinas tied togetheer?
[fatpidgeybirb] @ they have to be genuine copies of the Ocarina of Time. Paradox copies are allowed
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Hm... I may know a guy that knows a guy that knows a guy's grandpa that owns them
[fatpidgeybirb] @ we have eternatus this weekend
[fatpidgeybirb] @ the grind is outrageous
[a_variety_pack] @ that was a gold?
[fatpidgeybirb] @ what does JotWaD stand for again
[swaync] @ doin alright, was doing TTYD yeah
[lemonmadelemonade] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Jump off the watchtower and die
[swaync] @ finished a run ~26s behind PB
[fatpidgeybirb] @ Ah, back from ads
[fatpidgeybirb] @ would you consider doing a soapcake run
[themasterzelda] @ you can just crawl into it
[themasterzelda] @ there's like 2 human crawl space in the entire game lol
[feli_heli] @ does a pb count as one big goal
[feli_heli] @ technically you got 3
[a_variety_pack] @ you lost 13 seconds to gold
[waddlemimir] @ midwest gothic who? this is hylian gothic
[fatpidgeybirb] @ run it back and bop him
[themasterzelda] @ there are many funny thing in kak
[themasterzelda] @ you can also do the king bulblin cutscene as wolf link which is awesome
[nukernoah] @ JOTWOD... so... Jump Off Top of Watchtower And Die?
[lemonmadelemonade] @ I am in the mood for some hahas and hoohoos
[feli_heli] @ do the thing where you break all the textures in the game
[annilyn2] @ appreciate the warning friend. do it
[fatpidgeybirb] @ do it, also super appreciate the warning
[themasterzelda] @ OH YOU MEAN THIS ONE THING
[feli_heli] @ im surprised the game still works when you do this
[fatpidgeybirb] @ textures often aren't integral to coding most times as long as they can direct to something, I think
[spinthra] @ me when i think of something funnier than 105 presses
[fatpidgeybirb] @ at least for vtuber models, you get replacement backup textures if you don't put in the right ones or you don't lock em
[fatpidgeybirb] @ oh this is bad
[a_variety_pack] @ awesome how nothing came of this
[feli_heli] @ didnt start timer NOOO
[fatpidgeybirb] @ it's fascinating to see the poly architexture actually
[feli_heli] @ the bitrate loves this
[lemonmadelemonade] @ How does that happen?
[nukernoah] @ And does this stay until reboot?
[spinthra] @ not as bad as the sa2 first person mod, but still pretty bad, love it
[annilyn2] @ that was so not what i expecting
[zeliversal] @ Streamer I have one small questiob
[annilyn2] @ i had to see if it was that bad
[waddlemimir] @ OH that is what the glubbers has as the game over thing
[themasterzelda] @ @Spinthra i hate how i know exactly what you mean
[zeliversal] @ Should I get a chicken parm or chicken ranch sandwich?
[waddlemimir] @ so this is the og terastallization
[fatpidgeybirb] @ I'm surprised the curtain has that many poly
[zeliversal] @ I don't have a chicken butter option :(
[themasterzelda] @ shocked nobody filled a complain about this town ngl
[themasterzelda] @ they partying a bit too hard
[themasterzelda] @ me trying to sleep in the town over Wokege
[themasterzelda] @ big fan of the skip milk
[fatpidgeybirb] @ holy shit it pulled an actual popular manga
[themasterzelda] @ also wrong door timeloss
[nukernoah] @ flaming garbage and I love it
[ghirahim_xc] @ this game looks like it's gonna explode KEKW
[themasterzelda] @ its impressive how it still runs pretty well KEKW
[fatpidgeybirb] @ the tiny bang story is a no-dialogue game that looks like a puzzle game, like barely a game
[fatpidgeybirb] @ looks like it was ported from mobile
[annilyn2] @ is it happening again?
[spinthra] @ sorry bot i am not going to watch a series of anime shorts that explains what things in another anime mean
[themasterzelda] @ two of them are pretty bad
[themasterzelda] @ there's a reason why i never did
[themasterzelda] @ and i was like
[themasterzelda] @ what the fuck did they do
[themasterzelda] @ it was genuinely starting to be good at the end of season 2
[themasterzelda] @ and then they 💩
[fatpidgeybirb] @ oh this game is *ancient*
[nukernoah] @ Oh iv'e seen this
[blacktiger51] @ um is link ok
[zeliversal] @ I can't watch shows. I'm an NPC
[fatpidgeybirb] @ yeah I'm sure he's fine
[nukernoah] @ He was just getting in touch with his inner demons
[ghirahim_xc] @ Haven't seen that one KEKW
[zeliversal] @ He's okay NOW. He had to cast the evil out of him
[themasterzelda] @ it can be bad
[ghirahim_xc] @ Haven't seen this either
[fatpidgeybirb] @ this game is so silly
[themasterzelda] @ that's the best one
[themasterzelda] @ never seen it but when you finish the escort if you are wolf its probably pretty messed up
[lemonmadelemonade] @ I'll be going to go sleep now. Have fun with the rest of the stream and good luck with after the stream activities
[ghirahim_xc] @ i love this one KEKW
[ghirahim_xc] @ I think you have to be human
[hylianlucas] @ this is the cutscene where you (the player) falls in love with zelda
[ghirahim_xc] @ I haven't seen this in a long time
[hylianlucas] @ "scanning for broken bones"
[fatpidgeybirb] @ I think he's beyond help
[fatpidgeybirb] @ gotta give the modelers credit, it doesn't break the game
[hylianlucas] @ and that kids is why hylians cant do *ncest!
[themasterzelda] @ that's one discord profile picture if i've ever seen one
[themasterzelda] @ link your legs are dragging into the floor
[hylianlucas] @ the sword is his new arm
[themasterzelda] @ now i really want to see the escort as wolf
[hylianlucas] @ KEKW as if nothing happened
[ghirahim_xc] @ Glad i remembered this one
[themasterzelda] @ glitchless prob has epona taming
[themasterzelda] @ its like 2m away
[themasterzelda] @ you go get owned by goron
[darkness3827] @ ah it looks like I've been missing out on some fun LUL
[themasterzelda] @ this one has some gameplay
[themasterzelda] @ yea this one is REALLY bad
[darkness3827] @ does Link have his head up his ass?
[themasterzelda] @ nah he's having a blast
[fatpidgeybirb] @ when the vertices and weight painting misbehave
[darkness3827] @ his polygons have entered another state.
[annilyn2] @ missing so much lolz
[themasterzelda] @ prob a lot of lanayru cutscenes are broken
[themasterzelda] @ getting grabbed as human in lake hylia
[themasterzelda] @ forgot it crashed the game
[themasterzelda] @ wait can you go goron wrestling as wolf
[themasterzelda] @ wait no you can do post twilight and just fly up to gorons
[annilyn2] @ gtg night! evo17Hiyo terragStalZone
[themasterzelda] @ Link just turns into a tube
[zeliversal] @ 58 of Phantom of 00
[zeliversal] @ May I have permission to politely sue Amazon a few times?
[icebound777] @ Yeah I have them loaded in another tab already, didn't look through them yet
[zeliversal] @ I was going to buy a controller for playing Nier and then I slept on it overnight and then they increased the price by $10 SirMad
[icebound777] @ Also, on-stream chat display is ded
[rgamer0] @ Yoy! phanto274Wave phanto274Smile iceblueArrive
[terppyslabs21] @ Hope you are having a good day! Found your YouTube over the weekend and gotta say I am hooked like the fishing episode of SpongeBob.
[icebound777] @ hate when that happens
[zeliversal] @ So can I sue? :)
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ Sounds good and like a plan to me
[rgamer0] @ hitting ya with the good badges right away
[zeliversal] @ Or can I at least write a strongly worded letter?
[zeliversal] @ "I was going to buy a controller for playing Nier and then I slept on it overnight and then they increased the price by $10  SirMad "
[rgamer0] @ Need one level to equip these badges
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ Had a great time yesterday at the card show. Got 2 slab haul. A Water rayquaza in a 6 and Shiny Articuno in a 9.
[rgamer0] @ Hey a star spirit
[bsmith906] @ uuhhh did you just get a star spirit?
[zeliversal] @ It probably depends on how many I write YEP
[zeliversal] @ $10 is a lot of money
[zeliversal] @ That ALMOST buys you a potato
[icebound777] @ Well the spirits aren't "junk" junk. They can't be on Whacka or the OOL Rip Cheato checks
[robinwings_] @ Yo what up gamers
[robinwings_] @ Did I just see Misstar come out of that block?? LOL
[zeliversal] @ D: I'm getting robbed?
[rgamer0] @ Yo it's a child all alone
[robinwings_] @ Ohhh so cool :D
[zeliversal] @ Are they finally fixing the hot?
[icebound777] @ at which point do they just put you on the payroll frfr
[zeliversal] @ Will it be cooler now?
[rgamer0] @ Taunting you with the feesh you want
[rgamer0] @ Desert of many boots
[bsmith906] @ boots of people who died in the desert
[zeliversal] @ I want to take a nap but I also want dinner
[zeliversal] @ Imagine being practiced on
[rgamer0] @ Just drop a feesh from the heavens
[angellove94] @ 17 minutes in and 2 stars already?
[robinwings_] @ very fast seed Kappa
[angellove94] @ lol I’m at work
[angellove94] @ got to get back to work. wanted to stop by and say hi.
[mr_zebra776] @ what settings is this
[icebound777] @ curious, I've always done the storeroom escape without pushing right during, except for the last step
[icebound777] @ I usually do two parakarries without movement, and then a tap jump right to get the camera to turn
[icebound777] @ oh interesting, I never counted flaps for the ending, just doing a timed tap jump
[icebound777] @ Sure, could implement that. Tho that may go a bit against one of it's goals, which was making star pieces less of a bean counting endeavor
[icebound777] @ Oh, I see, yeah that could be done
[mr_zebra776] @ @Icebound777 IMO I think double is just a bit high so it could be it logically expects more than are required but less than double
[icebound777] @ The cheap setting for Merlow was just thrown in there, without any changes to the actual logic. But I could see adding a recalculation of logical star pieces required
[icebound777] @ On a similar topic, getting star pieces from vanilla letter checks. I've thought about addressing it, but then the chances for even earlier SuperBoots / UltraHammer for panels may manifest
[mr_zebra776] @ you would also want to take out the koot star pieces to
[icebound777] @ According to mariowiki there are 32 star pieces that dont come from letters, panels, quizmo or koot
[mr_zebra776] @ are these glitches in logic or are you just doing them?
[mr_zebra776] @ so kooper skip is enabled right :)
[mr_zebra776] @ for now at least
[mr_zebra776] @ what kooper locked LZ
[mr_zebra776] @ I mean it is the kooper bridge in crystal palace thatis required for
[icebound777] @ re-counted the star pieces: 64 quizmo, 15 koot, 36 panels, 11 letters, 34 overworld + item trades
[mr_zebra776] @ isn't there a way to activate it with watt
[axl_sr] @ Platinum AP is very close
[axl_sr] @ and by close I mean the first alpha, and it uses bizhawk
[icebound777] @ I think I do remember seeing a clip of a way of glitching a partner through that wall and that triggering the scene .... hm
[axl_sr] @ yeah i tired it and it booted the rom just fine
[icebound777] @ Or maybe that was people just experimenting with it via fp
[icebound777] @ It triggers with any partner IIRC, but the position check isn't that shallow
[mr_zebra776] @ give me a sec will send it
[icebound777] @ Yup. I had to implement a custom exception to this for entrance shuffle, otherwise it would just trigger every time you enter via that entrance
[icebound777] @ Wow that's so trivial
[icebound777] @ just hold watt into the wall??
[mr_zebra776] @ it seems like there is a little more to it
[mr_zebra776] @ based on the message right after it saying how to do it
[mr_zebra776] @ kooper is still required to beat the chapter though because of the bridge right after it
[mr_zebra776] @ yeah 1 block+ panel (+a 3rd with small statue skip)
[mr_zebra776] @ doesn't look like it
[mr_zebra776] @ probably because it would have no use in rando as you would always have kooper there before
[icebound777] @ Oh, I got it, took a bit tho. And while you can mash cdown for this, you can get yourself into a state where a crash is unavoidable
[mr_zebra776] @ yeah think it crashes ifyou hammer the guys or they pick you up
[mr_zebra776] @ so you have to do kooper puzzle skip afterwards
[icebound777] @ for me it also crashes when hammering kooper ...
[mr_zebra776] @ maybe picking up doesn't crash am not sure
[mr_zebra776] @ haven't actually tested it much
[icebound777] @ yeah, in the thread it mentions that every option here crashes on n64, only wii vc survives hammering kooper
[icebound777] @ so, no bueno for rando
[mr_zebra776] @ doing puzzle skip didn't crash I thought
[mr_zebra776] @ so it could be useful in rando
[icebound777] @ oh i meant every option other than puzzle skip
[icebound777] @ you crash when hammering either kooper or fake koopers
[icebound777] @ oh i havent tried that
[icebound777] @ No crash on getting grabbed by the NPCs. I was unable to try (and fail) kooper puzzle skip like 6-7 times until I got it
[icebound777] @ Yup, I've got no qualms with this. Clippy can also crash if you do it wrong, as axl demonstrated in the bug reports channel once xp
[darkness3827] @ yo berserk strats lfg!
[icebound777] @ ayo a feeling fine alternative
[darkness3827] @ immunity to status effects is very nice!
[mr_zebra776] @ yeah getting grabbed is fine it is just hammering
[icebound777] @ berserker builder mario is just entirely orange
[rgamer0] @ Lake's heating source is malfunctioning
[icebound777] @ time for the sound of 🇫
[icebound777] @ not long enough for the estimate
[icebound777] @ how long can we ride the berserker train for
[rgamer0] @ Chapter 4 is likely to push the Go mode button
[icebound777] @ need stacking berserkers. see mario go ssj3
[rgamer0] @ Don't you mean Ultra Mario One?
[0b1jc0b] @ mario went Super Star Rod Super Star!
[0b1jc0b] @ oh, Berserker was made by Intelligent Sys? idek there were beta badges
[icebound777] @ show the long item description in the badge menu, lol
[peelb4758] @ Yo, first time catching a rando!
[icebound777] @ really late chapter 6 also narrows down you available locations a bit
[peelb4758] @ Wait autosmash isn't vanilla, right?
[icebound777] @ fun useless trivia, when I was first experimenting with progressive gear (w/o clover's help at that time) I used the auto jump/smash as item sprites for the progressive items
[rgamer0] @ Prepare for annihilation Crystal King
[icebound777] @ he sure tried, again
[peelb4758] @ Poor CK, he didn't see it coming
[icebound777] @ im still waiting for one of the seeds to be on a chapter clear reward
[rgamer0] @ Surely a seed or a stone should be here
[icebound777] @ Actually, that's kinda bad ... having a chapter entering item on a boss reward, that's just logical rowf but more extreme
[icebound777] @ Isn't a chapter boss reward just like a 4th rowf item for that set? for the first few chapters anyway
[peelb4758] @ Ohhh, I thought it was Ralph
[venlafaxinequeen] @ is this an all chapters rando?
[morpheus0800] @ TIL the only channels i follow on this account are yours and pape races KEKW
[icebound777] @ Wasnt pape rando on RNG at some point?
[morpheus0800] @ i think i've only been on passion project and think fast
[morpheus0800] @ yeah a few months back
[morpheus0800] @ and think fast was all cards with jcog
[venlafaxinequeen] @ Think fast is very fun
[venlafaxinequeen] @ i’d kill at it
[morpheus0800] @ all i know is i got 3 capped by jr in that run and was sad about it KEKW
[morpheus0800] @ it was so sketch with how barebones all cards already is, im surprised i even finished under estimate
[morpheus0800] @ why did it just skip 16 lmfao
[darkness3827] @ Here, have some mail!
[icebound777] @ will we berserker hallway for content?
[darkness3827] @ Berserker Final would be maximum content
[icebound777] @ ispy is the most edible looking badge. like a decorated cookie
[icebound777] @ id rather shuffle quizmo pieces
[icebound777] @ which isnt that terribly unlikely tbf
[peelb4758] @ I want to eat damage dodge and no one can stop me
[icebound777] @ we're kind of running out of items to shuffle though. trumpet plants, fire bars ...
[darkness3827] @ Oh doing each individual location that makes more sense. I was thinking making each question a check LUL
[icebound777] @ I find the thought of 10 random consumables amusing tbh
[icebound777] @ but not seriously considering that
[icebound777] @ I don't think I have thought about it since coin bags became a thing, so ... yeah makes sense
[darkness3827] @ Make every single enemy encounter be a check LUL
[darkness3827] @ Yeah also what would you need add to the pool for those? Just more coins and consumables?
[icebound777] @ Apparently people have been enjoying tattlesanity in ttydr
[darkness3827] @ I mean ig it gives you a reason to use tattle, idk what like any of the tattles are so it'd be fun to see them all but I'd never want to play it more than once.
[icebound777] @ I haven't tried it (for lack of a ntsc ttyd disc), but tattlesanity sounds kind of dry
[icebound777] @ I mean, that's what the new pit checkpoints are for, so I wouldn't mind that part
[icebound777] @ the two pape rando channels are the only channels on the AP discord I pretty much "monitor"
[icebound777] @ I also follow the Luigi's Mansion one, but that still needs some time in the oven from what I've seen of bug reports
[peelb4758] @ SPM has an enemy rando im fairly sure
[peelb4758] @ I remember seeing a mod that added turn based battles to SPM, but it was really bare bones
[icebound777] @ This seems like over half an hour under estimate
[icebound777] @ That sleepy sheep from Mamar is fitting
[peelb4758] @ Just add koopa koot Kappa
[icebound777] @ dungeon shuffle adds asinine backtracking at times, but it's not the longest treks ever
[icebound777] @ Yeah, and even if it's in a bad location just grab the area hint from hallway
[venlafaxinequeen] @ when is your run?
[icebound777] @ What was it that caused the 3:45 estimate again, in terms of settings?
[icebound777] @ Oh so more tricks, and jumpless hammerless
[icebound777] @ Yeah, not both at least
[darkness3827] @ you don't enjoy bombing the block you have to hit 100 times???
[morpheus0800] @ is there anything else for a mash that actually just sucks ass like power shock
[morpheus0800] @ or did they make it uniquely bad
[icebound777] @ Did you grab the dodge master from Rowf
[morpheus0800] @ they looked at dizzy shell and said never again
[icebound777] @ Ah, shows what I know
[morpheus0800] @ the visual for fire is so weird here
[morpheus0800] @ could jump on a koopratrol COPIUM
[theglubbers] @ it's a 3h estimate right
[theglubbers] @ is it posible to just add another chapter or is that inconsistent
[theglubbers] @ oh i saw the one greyed out and was like "isn't this all but one"
[darkness3827] @ star rod shuffle when?
[theglubbers] @ i saw the numbers, assumed it was that, then realized wait you get the star spirits and realized the answer was the same regardless
[peelb4758] @ Wait star spirit shuffle is a thing?
[morpheus0800] @ is it ever normal with this fight
[morpheus0800] @ this happens every time i watch
[morpheus0800] @ i wouldn't know, im too busy dying to time out
[peelb4758] @ Someone said dungeon shuffle?
[darkness3827] @ panels with vague hints is cool and doesn't add a ton of time
[rgamer0] @ Yeah need to add in things
[mariomantaw] @ What are the settings like here?
[rgamer0] @ Panels and dungeon shuffle and boss shuffle
[darkness3827] @ Yeah have you done an event run with hints before?
[mariomantaw] @ Just turn on Bombette pushes YEP
[peelb4758] @ Yeah there was that one seed in the shuffler that didn't get a hammer for ages
[theglubbers] @ oh yeah izzy finished another emote
[theglubbers] @ she's got one more she's working on
[theglubbers] @ it's ciela but everyone's gonna say navi lmfao
[theglubbers] @ cuz in PH the one using the hammer is ciela
[iceblue] @ what the hell was your channel name before cause of that prefix?
[iceblue] @ That's more on brand
[theglubbers] @ @Iceblue the only reason it's not changed is that "cmdrgl" is shit but its better than "glubbe2"
[mariomantaw] @ Multi-coin blocks don't add that much, do they?
[theglubbers] @ er that was the old one, "theglu4"
[iceblue] @ Just use "cumglub" as your prefix
[mariomantaw] @ I guess yeah there are several in the desert
[darkness3827] @ @Iceblue think it would be cumglu
[theglubbers] @ if i could have a custom prefix maybe monadoHands
[iceblue] @ my prefix is 7 letters
[iceblue] @ hell my prefix is literally my name
[theglubbers] @ partners get more leniency
[mariomantaw] @ Yeah just get partner Clueless
[theglubbers] @ genius ice, i just lost my job so maybe i should go on that partner grind Clueless
[peelb4758] @ Wow, 'lmao' is censored for me, but not 'cumglu'
[iceblue] @ the shit desi had to do to get that prefix
[iceblue] @ he's had it removed before
[iceblue] @ he got reported for it by some homophobe
[iceblue] @ and he argued, and got it back
[rgamer0] @ Gay means happy, what you mean it has other meanings phanto274Thonk
[rgamer0] @ I mean it gives LP a chance rather then getting LP skipped every time you finish chapter 5
[icebound777] @ at the top, gameplay tab
[darkness3827] @ That's one way to add time, don't skip LP :P
[peelb4758] @ Wait this is GROOVY phanto274Jam
[icebound777] @ That reminds me, I read something about someone getting the everdrive recognized as removable media via the dev port. And use it to transfer files
[darkness3827] @ I was gonna say if you're asking it must be dog island LUL
[peelb4758] @ Been a while since I've heard a marimba solo
[icebound777] @ krikzz example code does something like that as well
[darkness3827] @ I don't even know what locations exist for it to be in the game LUL
[peelb4758] @ I've never even heard of dog Island
[darkness3827] @ I've only heard of it from you.
[rgamer0] @ Beware of Huskies and Malinois
[theglubbers] @ i told pippy you run dog island and she was like "they do????"
[darkness3827] @ Damn that's chill music for a boss fight.
[theglubbers] @ i think it was like in the post run channel after LASS
[peelb4758] @ No I just finished exams for the year, I don't need a tests on dog Island knowledge
[rgamer0] @ Husky will be stubborn and destructive and Malinois are literal crack addicts
[theglubbers] @ yep she told me about this
[theglubbers] @ she already leaked this verbally and that's how it came up
[rgamer0] @ Chihuahuas are angry little munchkins
[peelb4758] @ Omg 2 seeds in a day, as a VODhead, this is unheard of
[mariomantaw] @ 2 Fortress Keys is crazy
[mariomantaw] @ Fortress Keys already don't even matter
[swiftpichu_] @ the fuck did nancy do to you
[mariomantaw] @ Oh right that's what the partner was for
[mariomantaw] @ Well not for ch1, maybe for ch3 though if we're lucky
[mariomantaw] @ This seed is amazing already
[darkness3827] @ guess you're doin danger strats LUL
[mariomantaw] @ Coin blocks are on, right?
[mariomantaw] @ My stream delay is being funky today apparently
[peelb4758] @ Yeah I've got barely any
[theglubbers] @ i swapped to firefox from chrome ~1mo ago and my delay has gone to near zero
[mariomantaw] @ Third Fortress Key HUH
[rgamer0] @ Boots in the desert again
[angellove94] @ the desert and toy box are usually the gold mines
[icebound777] @ It plays a metallic sound
[iceblue] @ Quick someone cheer 690
[theglubbers] @ phantom, how is walk peahat clip supposed to work on a dpad
[iceblue] @ Unless you changed it
[iceblue] @ It used to be 690
[iceblue] @ Yeah but i want the one that lasts a minute lol
[iceblue] @ omg thank you LUL
[iceblue] @ The zoom in while mario beats the block gets me every time
[darkness3827] @ no not the hustle drink :(
[iceblue] @ Phantom for no reason at all, you should add a 6969 bit alert, where it's mario hitting that block... but for 5 minutes straight
[iceblue] @ I made a bit alert for "Dental Plan, Lisa needs braces" but it's just them back and forth for 2 minutes
[iceblue] @ And I set it to like 1500
[iceblue] @ And people have done it LUL
[iceblue] @ The people love memes
[iceblue] @ Lemme go see how long it actually is
[iceblue] @ Okay, it's 74 seconds long
[peelb4758] @ Wait weren't you gonna turn on panel hints?
[iceblue] @ omg i clicked preview
[rgamer0] @ Mucho iceblueBet this seed
[iceblue] @ power shock is cheap
[mariomantaw] @ Hey wait a minute, this isn't where you use Fortress Keys...

[mariomantaw] @ This seed is amazing
[nina_calico] @ iceblueBan kiawaBONK phanto274Ban zoiBonk
[mariomantaw] @ I'm not sure this is going to be much slower lol
[mariomantaw] @ It's not like you cleared out the extra checks in the first 20 minutes or anything
[mariomantaw] @ And already have a ton of good stuff
[laichan] @ all i just hear is "auto smack" as im trying to get stuff done
[swiftpichu_] @ sent something if you haven't seen it
[swiftpichu_] @ I laughed so fucking hard
[swiftpichu_] @ how many life shrooms are there in the game?
[mariomantaw] @ Oh, why'd you choose to make them invisible? For Watt logic? Or was it just the preset?
[darkness3827] @ mario, you have to jump to jump
[darkness3827] @ Sushie sacrifices herself to kill Blooper
[mariomantaw] @ I mean, the Laki TP isn't THAT hard
[mariomantaw] @ We have video documentation now at least
[mariomantaw] @ You could beat Toybox with a detour to town, right?
[mariomantaw] @ Oh right Toybox clip, also wasn't sure if Watt skip is in logic
[mariomantaw] @ Surely this is Fortress, right?
[mariomantaw] @ Took a different spirit than usual hostage
[peelb4758] @ We need to save him
[pierrezebub] @ Bo in black and white is a vibe!
[mariomantaw] @ That would've been a good one, yeah
[peelb4758] @ With star spirit shuffle, is it just for star moves, or do you need them for star rod?
[peelb4758] @ Is it just a better flower saver?
[peelb4758] @ Yeah, not worth 7 lol
[ezzlin] @ I tried out Kirby 64 per your recommendation, it was fun!
[ezzlin] @ Sounds good, have fun with the rest of your seed
[mariomantaw] @ So just don't miss the blocks YEP
[peelb4758] @ It's calling to you
[mariomantaw] @ And we still haven't found the Fortress HUH
[mariomantaw] @ I bet the other magical seed is somewhat early
[peelb4758] @ We can save the hostage now
[mariomantaw] @ We'll have lots of star power for all the bosses now, huh
[impurpp] @ how'd you know? :o
[impurpp] @ lol monday night bingo was tonight
[impurpp] @ cool! lol how many last minute showcases have you done before?
[impurpp] @ I just remember that pokepark thing
[peelb4758] @ Will that just be on GDQ's Twich?
[janitorbeav] @ wait so we get double Phantom on GDQ?
[mariomantaw] @ I knew this would be early, Fortress HAS to be in chapter 6... surely...
[peelb4758] @ Wait, what day is it for you?
[peelb4758] @ I'm Australian btw,  that's why I asked
[peelb4758] @ Time zones are stupid
[rgamer0] @ Shy Guys of the damned
[janitorbeav] @ and waiting for you behind door #3 is death
[swiftpichu_] @ what's in door 4

[mariomantaw] @ Oh right I guess you can, how long have you had Star Stone?
[themasterzelda] @ you could have what?
[themasterzelda] @ but Watt could you have had?
[peelb4758] @ That is the question
[mariomantaw] @ I thought it was a Life Shroom too lol
[peelb4758] @ The beta badges are cool but I have no clue what they do
[mariomantaw] @ I bet you could
[mariomantaw] @ But idk for sure

[mirby_studios] @ that is the weirdest way i've ever seen quesadilla spelled lmao
[pierrezebub] @ i use ranch instead of sour cream with my quesadillas xD
[iceblue] @ see that's fine pierre
[blacktiger51] @ who know maybe we all bots Kappa
[iceblue] @ i just hate sour cream lol
[mirby_studios] @ ranch with quesadillas is fine, like it's pretty common
[mirby_studios] @ like bacon ranch quesadillas are something i see often
[peelb4758] @ i like microwaving cheese and BBQ sauce together on a plate till it's a puddle
[venlafaxinequeen] @ I love sour cream but sour cream doesn’t like me
[pierrezebub] @ i put some of that leftover costco rotisserie on mine usually xD
[peelb4758] @ Its good I swear
[mirby_studios] @ and in today's chat, we have people i am banning from my kitchen forever

[iceblue] @ That one koopa probably likes anchovies on pizza
[peelb4758] @ Their just salty goodness
[mirby_studios] @ i don't like them but maddy does
[str9ngest9r] @ They definitely look gross lol
[rgamer0] @ They're just salt bombs
[pierrezebub] @ anchovies on a white pie aint bad
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ @Iceblue Whats ur toppings and go to then?
[iceblue] @ all of you need the time out corner
[rgamer0] @ I'm freaking so basic with toppings
[peelb4758] @ This seed is giving me seed 4 flashbacks
[rgamer0] @ Maybe I need to put hot honey on my pizzas
[iceblue] @ coulda just walked outside
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ maple syrup and honey on pizza sausage
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ dont know if preggo or raugu would be the better mix on that
[rgamer0] @ Pizza would be best in the summer
[mirby_studios] @ @stavros12c34anenoglou it's Prego. not preggo. the sauce is not pregnant lmao
[iceblue] @ not yet it's not mirby
[mirby_studios] @ that's the white sauce
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ u should live stream ur quessidella phantom

[str9ngest9r] @ Yoo food stream?? phanto274BLANKIES
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ the hunt for the key begins
[rgamer0] @ I think we found the ideal settings for your hotfix
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ @Rgamer0 yes recipe settings
[vixey_lycan] @ what about the chest up top in the elevator room?
[iceblue] @ did we find the last key?
[iceblue] @ that looks very unshuffled
[rgamer0] @ So these settings seem to be final then minus a few of the glitch logic tricks
[rgamer0] @ Parakarry was so late in the logic chain
[rgamer0] @ My guess is finishing around a 3:10
[rgamer0] @ So which boss got skipped today
[rgamer0] @ So they were waiting in the Volcano and never got the chance to fight because they got cooked
[rgamer0] @ Anyone want to check up on those poor Koopa Bros?
[peelb4758] @ would a cooked koopa bro go well with sour cream?
[iceblue] @ wtf what skolar need shoes for
[rgamer0] @ Remember that last seed all the shoes were in the desert
[iceblue] @ put it on stavros's pizza
[peelb4758] @ omg I just remembered a crazy pizza i had as a kid
[peelb4758] @ it was a loaded vegemite pizza
[peelb4758] @ Im Aussie so I have to disagree
[adamx0315] @ I see you're doing hotfix
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ @Iceblue i cant reach sour cream and the quesadilla to put on my pizza and speaking of this topic got to put the rest of it in the fridge.
[adamx0315] @ do you need support
[peelb4758] @ do you know what time it will be?
[rgamer0] @ Oh hey you guys were cooked
[adamx0315] @ Okay nvm I retract that now knowing the time KEKW
[know15] @ no take backsies Adam
[adamx0315] @ I mean I'm technically not full-time employment, but I do value my sleep schedule KEKW

[iceblue] @ how much for slow go
[angellove94] @ I only have 200
[themasterzelda] @ its just that easy

[adamx0315] @ I was like "for what"
[angellove94] @ I have 1 bit left 🤣
[themasterzelda] @ LOOK AT THE PACE
[adamx0315] @ I may need to start using that
[angellove94] @ thanks for humoring us phantom
[venlafaxinequeen] @ What is even the point of slow go?
[iceblue] @ How much to go back and get the last rip cheato item
[know15] @ with slow go on @iceblue?
[iceblue] @ I just want more rando LUL
[themasterzelda] @ ah yes all the emotes i already have

[themasterzelda] @ that was the easiest bowser fight i've seen in a while
[impurpp] @ Cheer100 a give phantom money train?? I'm in (GG)
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ I had Peperoni pizza slathered with Lobster bisque and corn bread with mixed veggies and added garlic celery and onions bonus on the noodles. BTW.
[rgamer0] @ The pizza still needs to be able to hold up with all of that
[angellove94] @ I’m heading to bed soon. have to work tomorrow
[str9ngest9r] @ Hope you have a great night, that sounds bomb af phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES

[rgamer0] @ Yoy! phanto274Wave phanto274Smile iceblueArrive
[shrike890] @ Joooo lets gooo for great runs this day 😁 good luck buddy you will do this !
[venlafaxinequeen] @ She paper on my Mario until I rando
[venlafaxinequeen] @ Seattle is nice 😊
[mariomantaw] @ phanto274GL Oh that's new
[venlafaxinequeen] @ Is someone going to be on coms for your runs?
[wolfyhii] @ finally playing some Echoes of Wisdom after... one year
[wolfyhii] @ yeah i got it for my birthday (sep 26th) played for like 4 hours and haven't touched it since KEKW
[mariomantaw] @ Bucket doesn't necessarily matter either
[wolfyhii] @ part of it was my gf not wanting to be spoiled and she likes watching whatever game i play so i didn't want to ruin it for her
[wolfyhii] @ the rest of the time was laziness
[peelb4758] @ I'm still not spoiled on echo's of wisdom because one day I'll have the free time to play it
[wolfyhii] @ i only made it to like the second area but i've avoided spoilers all this time aside from people just saying they liked it
[peelb4758] @ Yeah, same here. I've seen the intro and tutorial, but that's it
[wolfyhii] @ i got it gifted to me for my birthday i felt bad not playing it all this time uuh
[peelb4758] @ I got Skyward Sword HD for my birthday a few years ago and made it most of the way through but lost interest
[wolfyhii] @ did you ever play og skyward sword peel?
[peelb4758] @ Nah, I had a wii,  but only played Skylanders on it
[wolfyhii] @ ok yeah cuz Skyward Sword is a very highs and lows type game so i don't blame you giving up on it phanto274Smile
[zeliversal] @ That room is hated
[peelb4758] @ Yeah, there's that one boss fight against that big purple guy that you do like 8 times I swear
[wolfyhii] @ fight the imprisoned three times PLUS ghirahim three times as well
[wolfyhii] @ the best part of Skyward Sword is the middle section
[peelb4758] @ It was too much for me phanto274Sigh
[oakest5000] @ phanto274Smile and the bandits have the same eyes I just noticed
[wolfyhii] @ the first revisit to areas is actually good
[wolfyhii] @ the second revisit is when it gets stale
[wolfyhii] @ it does the beginning is a massive slog
[wolfyhii] @ yeah that's totally fair the game just lacks variety
[rgamer0] @ Whelp the game decided where you're going this seed
[wolfyhii] @ he should've been a mini boss
[wolfyhii] @ the flamboyant bad guy
[rgamer0] @ Damn Ultra hammer right away
[peelb4758] @ Omg I hate that guys fight, but he is an icon
[rgamer0] @ He's basically a gimmick fight for all of his boss fights
[zeliversal] @ Like, I get the point that it was supposed to 'teach' you how sword position mattered, except for the fact that we had TONS of enemies up to that point that had that mechanic
[wolfyhii] @ to be fair every fight in skyward sword could be labeled as "a gimmick fight" because of the nature of the controls PrideLaugh
[wolfyhii] @ @Zeliversal literally the stalfos in that SAME dungeon already serves that purpose
[peelb4758] @ And the deku babas
[rgamer0] @ Yeah it's not fun when every fight is figure out which way his shield isn't guarded against
[zeliversal] @ And then it's like "Oh it teaches you that he can steal your sword if you're not careful" except that NEVER comes up again
[zeliversal] @ Like the ONLY thing that fight does accomplish in it's intended writing is teaching you "You are currently in over your head and nothing except headstrong"
[zeliversal] @ Except literally any other fight could have accomplished that
[rgamer0] @ D-Down Pound is okay
[zeliversal] @ Case of "Great story, less than idea execution"
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ Hey all!  obiyoLurk    phanto274Lurk    urooglLurk    zachar4Lurk   mode indeed activated injured right arm on groceries.
[zeliversal] @ I feel like the motion controls were super cool and I liked the gimmicks, but I think it just needed a better translation into the game for it to be more friendly
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ Yay got my gold train the raid out didnt screw me over
[oakest5000] @ more points at least
[wolfyhii] @ it does have great dungeons
[wolfyhii] @ story and dungeons are the best parts of ss
[themasterzelda] @ you say that like its a coincidence
[themasterzelda] @ some days i don't feel like debating
[amishman19] @ gl on the seeds, hopefully you’re closer to estimate on these lol
[themasterzelda] @ i hope there's someone who knows nothing about the game
[themasterzelda] @ meme aside it can make for nice commentary
[blacktiger51] @ ok i swear the redeem just know what to play KEKW
[amishman19] @ that Yugioh redeem is gold
[themasterzelda] @ has anyone ever held a n64 controller properly?
[mariomantaw] @ I have played this game... and held an N64 controller... but never both at the same time...
[rgamer0] @ Can't wait in a few months when there's a bunch of Yu-Gi-Oh product that I'm going to buy
[hexspeedruns] @ actually did stuff today so i’m vibing
[amishman19] @ Okay I gotta here the reason for the N64 controller being that way. I have a hunch but I can’t remember if my hunch is right
[rgamer0] @ Time to ground feesh
[hexspeedruns] @ have you ever done TTYD rando?
[peelb4758] @ Holy air Ball from Nintendo
[amishman19] @ Okay that was along the lines of what I remembered hearing, I was not quite correct
[themasterzelda] @ oh boy i love shadow queen cutscenes
[hexspeedruns] @ my first playthrough was the remaster lol
[mariomantaw] @ There's a new dev build with some removed cutscenes
[mariomantaw] @ With those being among the few removed
[amishman19] @ Shadow Queen cutscenes FeelsOkayMan
[themasterzelda] @ maybe i'll try it
[themasterzelda] @ shadow queen cutscenes is a deal breaker for me
[oakest5000] @ I never played the original ttyd but I’ve 100 percented the switch remake twice
[themasterzelda] @ i'll never finish a seed if there's 10m of cutscenes at the end
[themasterzelda] @ i struggle at finishing randos because i lose interest real fast
[rgamer0] @ Mailman stuck in a tree makes sense phanto274Notes phanto274Thonk
[mariomantaw] @ It's a dev build, so you have to have the tester role in the TTYDR server but it exists
[themasterzelda] @ ideally it would be the remake warp room
[mariomantaw] @ I quite like the fast travel but I've only done 1-2 seeds w/ it
[peelb4758] @ I love a good warp room
[rgamer0] @ It's funny Chapter 5 now makes sense
[amishman19] @ getting rid of spinning was horrendous
[themasterzelda] @ i love how yoshi is the fastest movement but it quite literally cannot jump stairs
[peelb4758] @ Origami king had amazing overworld game play, that's where my praise ends
[mariomantaw] @ With 64's movement and world size, I'd agree that that level of fast travel is unnecessary but it's quite nice in TTYD
[themasterzelda] @ for sure, but its also more work
[peelb4758] @ Is that easy to implement, I've got no clue about anything but mine craft modding
[mariomantaw] @ I think the map warps might be optional actually
[themasterzelda] @ that kind of things benefit a lot from being options imo
[mariomantaw] @ I would rather have them than not for races but I don't race it lol
[peelb4758] @ Customisability my beloved phanto274Love
[mariomantaw] @ Yeah, the fast travel is a setting you can turn on/off lol
[peelb4758] @ It's a great multi world game as a viewer
[mariomantaw] @ And it defaults to off
[peelb4758] @ Oops, misclick. No need to hold anything
[peelb4758] @ Was that quake jump?
[peelb4758] @ As a certified VOD-head, tattle-sanity is exciting because it mixes up how you do battles, instead of just being as optimal as possible
[peelb4758] @ It's like a mini-challenge every battle
[peelb4758] @ He almost made it out on his own
[rgamer0] @ Thankfully Toybox is baby zone
[rgamer0] @ This seed is heavily hinting 7 coming up
[peelb4758] @ What does 'bonus damage' mean, in the badge menu. Is it a dev build thing?
[robinwings_] @ Yo what's up gamer
[peelb4758] @ Oh is that the badge synergy thing you mention a few runs ago?
[tweak613] @ Like how quake hammer gets a buff if you equip all three?
[0b1jc0b] @ is there a simple reason why the bonuses exist?
[0b1jc0b] @ im taking that as 'no' :)
[0b1jc0b] @ nah - 'some person with prolly lots of game understanding wanted it' ain't simple :)
[amishman19] @ don’t forget the colour palettes
[peelb4758] @ I just keep accidentally doing lzs, if only there was a way to prevent it Kappa
[realblopez] @ yo amish ty for the gl

[axl_sr] @ yo phantom, pokemon twitch is doing the anime again so was enjoying early johto episodes

[a_variety_pack] @ Shamrock7 when was the last time you failed to escape
[wolfyhii] @ why was it agitha
[a_variety_pack] @ i don't like bugs tho
[a_variety_pack] @ not EVEN if they're gold
[peelb4758] @ I would've lost all of my points on that bet
[rgamer0] @ Hey we found star beam!
[wolfyhii] @ i always think the star beam is the Archipelago logo
[peelb4758] @ "Mario will never find the star rod here!"
[a_variety_pack] @ i am getting cologne sidebar ads do i have a manly aura
[a_variety_pack] @ i mean i guess i would have a manly aura if i used cologne
[axl_sr] @ has the new tracker update been pushed to emo?
[axl_sr] @ alright, i just wont touch the new stuff then
[peelb4758] @ i use a a very expensive cologne. its called 'lynx'
[peelb4758] @ i think they call it 'axe' or something in america?
[axl_sr] @ So you never forget again just remember... Chet Rippo is the one that looks like a platypus, which is fitting because his name rhymes with hippo, and hippos and platypuses are both semi aquatic mammals. meanwhile Rip Cheato is the one that moreso fits the gamer stereotype, and Cheetos are a large part of the stereotypical gamer's diet. Cheer100
[axl_sr] @ that legit is how i remember it lmao
[axl_sr] @ i think i swipped that from Maddie
[peelb4758] @ its the exact same brand just a different name
[oakest5000] @ whuts the flavour of a hustle drink? is it just red bull
[peelb4758] @ it looks like pepto bismol
[blacktiger51] @ no red bulls give you wings
[oceanicthoughts] @ Its just a tropical redbull with a splash of tabasco
[oakest5000] @ maybe it’s just a bottle of lstd and makes you forget how turns work
[oceanicthoughts] @ Ive never had it lol but Im sure itd do something to make you act twice
[peelb4758] @ @OceanicThoughts thats just 4 loco
[oceanicthoughts] @ Pre or post formular change peel?
[peelb4758] @ we dont have 4 loco in Australia, I just know it as the frat boy drink
[oceanicthoughts] @ Ive never had them but Ive heard the watermelon ones are decent
[audioblood] @ Original 4 loko went hard asf, new 4 loko is mild
[audioblood] @ The original was just also caffeine loaded or something so it was an energy drink that got you fucked up
[audioblood] @ Correct, uppers and downers should not mix
[oceanicthoughts] @ Dont mix your uppers with your downers
[peelb4758] @ that sounds like a free ticket to the hospital
[audioblood] @ She has a grass for you, but she put it over there
[peelb4758] @ she made you put in the effort to touch grass
[audioblood] @ Yeah, it was forcibly removed
[audioblood] @ I was on that shit in high school, it was super not ok
[oceanicthoughts] @ It was dangerous yeah, there was concern of like alcohol poisoning and people being prone to blackouts and heart conditions
[audioblood] @ I think so, I don't remember. Lemme see if google knows
[oakest5000] @ give kolarado the artifact
[audioblood] @ It was 12-14% when I was drinking it in 2008
[wolfyhii] @ coca cola shy guy
[oceanicthoughts] @ I think one of the current popular "get you fucked up" drinks I cant stand myself are buzzballs
[oakest5000] @ anti guy looks like he’s made of gingerbread
[audioblood] @ I don't get drunk anymore, but when I did it was whatever was the best drunk:price ratio, did not care what the liquid was
[rgamer0] @ So essentially going full Husky mode
[oceanicthoughts] @ I dont really drink in general but buzzballs feel like your drinking... if the old Bug Juice things as kids were made in the same building as Pinesol but add alcohol
[audioblood] @ I've been following since april 2022 so I may or may not remember, time is a blur
[oakest5000] @ it does have a cool ending though
[audioblood] @ quickest way to get me off a game: make me grind
[audioblood] @ same, but i only played like 30h
[oakest5000] @ I’m really good at turning off my Brain when grinding
[wolfyhii] @ that's why i'm at the final boss in FF1 pixel remaster without having finished the game
[blacktiger51] @ speaking of dragon quest 11 i might do another playthrough
[oceanicthoughts] @ I am fine with grinding but like. I need something else to do in the meantime. Throw on a stream or have something going to pass the time
[rgamer0] @ And I'm going to do Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D remake in a few months
[wolfyhii] @ that's what i've heard about 3 lmao
[peelb4758] @ omg, i just looked it up, and in Australia they had to cut the alcohol content of 4 loko by HALF to be legal to sell
[rgamer0] @ Yeah FFIII has a nasty endgame
[blacktiger51] @ its only take like 30 mins to get to level 99 on dq11 so i didn't mind it ( i done it 2 times)
[wolfyhii] @ i full odds shiny hunt in Pokemon from time to time so i don't mind grinding if it's something i care about
[audioblood] @ @wolfyhii grinding because i want to and because i feel forced to are very different things
[amishman19] @ good riddance worst pyroguy
[oceanicthoughts] @ Grinding is like... doing housework. Sometimes you just get that motivation to take out the trash or do the dishes and everything is fine but the moment someone asks or tells you to it is the suddenly the absolute worst
[peelb4758] @ big lantern ghost mixed his whites and reds in the wash
[blacktiger51] @ i rather grind then go get collectibles
[peelb4758] @ min maxed partners ftw
[rgamer0] @ Also RIP General Guy's tune
[oceanicthoughts] @ Are partner upgrades random then? Like an item in a box could just be "Bombette Upgraded" ?
[rgamer0] @ We found you in here already
[swiftpichu_] @ I love shoving Chipotles up my ass and shit seeds
[swiftpichu_] @ Look sometimes you gotta spice things up
[rgamer0] @ I eat chinese hot peppers
[swiftpichu_] @ Even if that means one's own ass
[rgamer0] @ Like how many hours ago
[pierrezebub] @ GL for the rest of the run!
[pierrezebub] @ oh the star powers are also randomized , dope!
[blacktiger51] @ oh cool twitch have a Recommended Categories tab now let see gacha gacha and more gacha KEKW
[oakest5000] @ yo watt let’s go
[pierrezebub] @ Ah , and is the order you should get within logic or the order you grab them?
[peelb4758] @ wait i was alt tabbed what happened?
[amishman19] @ I think so KEKW
[pierrezebub] @ TY. sorry for the dumb questions , i only did rando for ALttP xD
[peelb4758] @ how many checks are there total?
[rgamer0] @ Went from no rank to ultra watt
[peelb4758] @ imma do some rough maths rq
[oceanicthoughts] @ Good Lord, I was just remember, when I first made my account, I started watching PM64 speedruns. This was around when GigaDB had WR. I just looked at the site and that was at least 9/10 years ago
[audioblood] @ Ooo oceanic your account is one of the oldest ones I've come across after mine
[pierrezebub] @ she just got back recently too
[audioblood] @ 2014 is a long time ago
[oceanicthoughts] @ Well a part of the group I was in had split a bit considering one of the guys later had some controversy with being a bit.. aggressive with his girlfriend and others at the time
[theglubbers] @ yo, i'm thinking of getting an uber for some cheese curds
[oceanicthoughts] @ So some of them definitely arent around lol
[rgamer0] @ I'll probably make some mac and cheese tonight
[pierrezebub] @ @TheGlubbers i second that
[peelb4758] @ unless my maths is wrong, it was a 1 in 179 700 for both watt upgrades to be in that specific tree
[oceanicthoughts] @ At least that group in general split ways and did their own thing
[rgamer0] @ With some fried eggs on the side
[theglubbers] @ alternatively i drive and get them myself and save $20
[pierrezebub] @ @TheGlubbers do you have a good cheeserie nearby your location? i have one about 30 mins away and i can get warm ones
[pierrezebub] @ depend if the parachute worked or not
[amishman19] @ Or would it be dove… Hmm
[oakest5000] @ sky dove I think
[rgamer0] @ Laki is such a troll
[pierrezebub] @ skydived correct , skydove accepted by urban dictionarries
[pierrezebub] @ according to the all knowing machine in my pocket
[oakest5000] @ go get power rush while delivering the artifact
[themasterzelda] @ ah yes urban dictionary the most reliable dictionary
[theglubbers] @ tmz do you still have matekta
[rgamer0] @ Beat it in all ways that matters minus the artifact
[morpheus080] @ @TheGlubbers no idea but it's been idling just fine since i finished bingo
[morpheus080] @ but im skeptical regardless
[amishman19] @ god that noise was crunchy Morph
[morpheus080] @ did you see the vc crash in posted phantom
[peelb4758] @ Im such a huge fan of the shiver mountain music
[rgamer0] @ Or just find the Palace Key here
[morpheus080] @ nice palace key location
[pierrezebub] @ orange is not bombettes color
[peelb4758] @ She slays no matter what she looks like
[oakest5000] @ I like all the colour swaps for the partners but bow definitely got the best ones
[pierrezebub] @ i agree , but girl needs to accessorice better , brown shoe with orange color is not it xD #RuPaperDragRace
[themasterzelda] @ oh koops is obsolete now?
[peelb4758] @ @PierreZebub you do have a point
[morpheus080] @ literally didn't know this was possible until you told me lmfao
[morpheus080] @ @TheMasterZelda unfortunately not, you still need him for the next mirror puzzle
[blacktiger51] @ i didn't know this was a thing
[morpheus080] @ how could they make an early game partner relevant in the second to last chapter
[morpheus080] @ how dare they even
[blacktiger51] @ that sounds like a trick i should learn
[pierrezebub] @ thats so cool though when a rando has its own little extra tactics that sr doesnt use
[blacktiger51] @ oh wait you cant beat the ch yeah fuck that
[themasterzelda] @ what exactly is kooper skip
[amishman19] @ god Kooper Skip is insane
[themasterzelda] @ does it fully skips kooper?
[amishman19] @ let me find a video TMZ
[themasterzelda] @ and it was a retro achievement? lmao who made that
[amishman19] @ actually disgusting watching it again
[amishman19] @ crazy people put that into runs
[themasterzelda] @ @Amishman19 what the fuck
[rgamer0] @ So go mode turtles
[themasterzelda] @ Rain — 10/30/2021 2:31 PM kooper skip is ez
[amishman19] @ Rain is an LZS freak
[themasterzelda] @ THAT MAKE MORE SENSE
[audioblood] @ Clicking the timeout button is a time honored way to kill pape runs
[oceanicthoughts] @ Not the cartoon fart cloud
[amishman19] @ pour one out for all of the runs that Timeout killed Lakhighlester
[peelb4758] @ gotta pour out a hustle drink for the one's we've lost
[amishman19] @ Goes to show crazy Random is tbh
[amishman19] @ yup 1:38:23 versus 1:37:07
[rgamer0] @ That's such a troll, Goombario power up
[oceanicthoughts] @ Are the dojo certs also random or are they left out?
[rgamer0] @ He had the turtle in a cloud
[oceanicthoughts] @ I figured as much lol
[rgamer0] @ So just Tubba's castle key for go then
[rgamer0] @ Well now it's just that lunar stone for go anyways
[rgamer0] @ Would be really funny if Gusty Gulch has the portrait and that Bow holds the Lunar stone
[venlafaxinequeen] @ what does Ripp Cheato give in vanilla?
[pierrezebub] @ the more i watch these rando stream , the more i realized that ive been underusing watt
[peelb4758] @ yo Phantom, gotta dip now, but I hope you have a great time at PAX!
[audioblood] @ A meme 600 coins
[audioblood] @ At least the insane amount of coins you need in TTYD can be gotten with the goofy sponsorship thing
[oceanicthoughts] @ Yeah, just sell everything that doesnt matter and buy like 72 power rush badges
[rgamer0] @ Watch this be go mode again
[oakest5000] @ what about the coin gambling games and the liloink machine
[oakest5000] @ yeah but cooking ultras and jellies, or just using save states
[rgamer0] @ So who was deleted?
[oakest5000] @ it costs 10 not 20
[oakest5000] @ that’s why you use the hammer exploit
[pbandjelly12] @ hey, doing my first randomizer right now. do you know of a way to save without the ability to jump?
[amishman19] @ the little animation is kind goofy too
[oakest5000] @ if you use save states and the hammer glitch you can collect every item without entering the fence and scaring them off
[oakest5000] @ ok what about the gamble games next to the lil oink fence
[oakest5000] @ is it the vase
[pbandjelly12] @ @Amishman19 can confirm, is goofy
[oakest5000] @ this seed was so bad
[amishman19] @ word for the wise, you can use zip lines without jumping too PBandJ
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ todays pizza toppings shrimp, deep fried potato, mixed veggies, beef, ketchup, and heavy garlic
[animatedelf] @ punishment for playing pap mario
[animatedelf] @ instead of the superior title
[rgamer0] @ So bad but will probably still make estimate
[pierrezebub] @ @stavros12c34anenoglou italian jambalaya on dough
[stavros12c34anenoglou] @ bow to the king at 3 hrs
[pbandjelly12] @ they're practically the same guy Tbh
[oakest5000] @ everything we need he says as two of the star spirits are just gone
[mirby_studios] @ oh cool they added in-app remapping to the SNES NSO app
[rgamer0] @ We know one of them requires Boo's Portrait
[mirby_studios] @ yeah but they just put a video about it on the SNES one up 8 minutes ago lol
[rgamer0] @ 6th star post 7th chapter
[rgamer0] @ Give Bowser this apple
[oceanicthoughts] @ You know, I have to respect the innovation Kammy brings along with "lets take the guy we thought was invincible and make him invincible-er"
[pbandjelly12] @ then he gets invincible-er-er
[oakest5000] @ GG  but yeah that sucked
[oceanicthoughts] @ Oh I remember watching a Bringle video on TTYD vs the Remake and why Power Bounce feels horrible. I guess for some reason in the remake they just make the 4th jump 1 frame button press then goes back to normal??
[rgamer0] @ Bad but still 5 minutes under estimate
[mirby_studios] @ or even hype point this video which is a thing now?
[mirby_studios] @ i don't get it
[mirby_studios] @ they're in america at least
[mirby_studios] @ folks were seeing them on the latest gametal who i know are also american lmao
[mirby_studios] @ and were like "wtf are these"
[pbandjelly12] @ the bobombs having arms in the parade is cursed
[oceanicthoughts] @ Ah probably then, Ill have to take a look
[animatedelf] @ That sounds like a glan thing to check
[mirby_studios] @ apparently when i high five lucky (one of the dogs i'm watching) while he's on his back it sets him upright like switch or something lmfao
[oceanicthoughts] @ Plus like, if its to discourage cheesing like PM64, why just the 4th and 8th?? Its so random and odd
[mirby_studios] @ he just did that 3 times in a row
[oceanicthoughts] @ That is weird yeah, youd think if anything itd give more incentive to get the switch 2
[pierrezebub] @ *sending the glubs signal , which is a light in the sky in the shape of a cheese curd*
[mirby_studios] @ i'm gonna mess with lucky some more during this break
[pbandjelly12] @ bean burrito time VoHiYo
[blacktiger51] @ damn i miss the ending
[mirby_studios] @ i really wish you could drag and drop what emotes were in what slots on twitch's emotes manager
[oceanicthoughts] @ I had curry. Tikka masala and rice
[pierrezebub] @ pizaa , but you play the stravos wheel
[oceanicthoughts] @ Thats fair, I only *just* found this place on the other side of town last friday and its so good
[blacktiger51] @ and you broke KEKW
[pierrezebub] @ that one bodega that has everything
[mirby_studios] @ but you could have vanilla pudding and sauerkraut and cinnamon pizza with the stavros wheel
[blacktiger51] @ next shop is also loaded
[mirby_studios] @ i got nauseous typing that
[pierrezebub] @ return to school shopping spree%
[oceanicthoughts] @ Lord Jabu Jabu in Paper Mario
[oceanicthoughts] @ If I have to
[mirby_studios] @ Pride100 sure fine here's a dollar
[oceanicthoughts] @ We commit to bits around here
[mirby_studios] @ pondering ideas for emotes, and what if gun emote but sword instead
[mirby_studios] @ like iceblueGun but sword lmao
[mirby_studios] @ oh yeah good point
[oceanicthoughts] @ I have to workshop some of my own later
[mirby_studios] @ yeah i just got a sketch back of maddy's new sona so i'm trying to think of emotes that would incorporate them
[mirby_studios] @ already gonna have them be notes and jam
[mirby_studios] @ i'm thinking bless as well
[mirby_studios] @ maddy did study to be a pastor years ago so i think it would be fitting lmao
[oceanicthoughts] @ I have 4 animated emotes I think. 1 isnt mine since its Bob from animal crossing, then 3 I drew (2 from games) but just using twitch's auto animate
[oceanicthoughts] @ oceani55BunWHAT oceani55DaveFury oceani55ViLeave oceani55Bob
[oceanicthoughts] @ One day Ill learn to make an actual animated one
[oceanicthoughts] @ oceani55Criplup Criplup will always be top tier though
[oceanicthoughts] @ Lol I can post it in the discord
[mirby_studios] @ life's hard in the streets of jubilife
[pbandjelly12] @ are the star spirits itemized or still boss rewards?
[rgamer0] @ Start is pretty similar to the last one
[rgamer0] @ Even down to the same spirits
[rgamer0] @ Only things different is hammer and shoe upgrade swapped
[mirby_studios] @ maddy replied to my idea
[rgamer0] @ She couldn't climb a tree
[oceanicthoughts] @ To be fair she has no arms
[mirby_studios] @ "you should use me for that one lol. cause im chaplin and can actually bless it"
[oceanicthoughts] @ Theres something kind of fitting about a monochromatic Bow
[pbandjelly12] @ removing creepy flower girl behind the tree is blessed
[pbandjelly12] @ Smack no, punch yes
[pbandjelly12] @ a man of principle
[pbandjelly12] @ koopa bros dropped him on the way back
[adamx0315] @ ohhey nice star spirit
[rgamer0] @ So he was free but broke his back and rendered unable to escape
[rgamer0] @ Sure would be nice to have a turtle of some kind
[oceanicthoughts] @ Tastes like shelled lizard
[witz2020] @ I've never had turtle, but I have eaten Python before
[oceanicthoughts] @ I dont remember, its been years since Ive had it
[pierrezebub] @ but like , most reptiles tastes like chicken cause of common ancestors tthe dinos
[mirby_studios] @ i did. they tasted swampy so they were not good
[rvpa] @ yeah alligator taste like chicken too
[oceanicthoughts] @ Frog legs tasting like chicken just means "theres very little meat and shit ton of fried batter and thats all youre going to taste"
[pbandjelly12] @ is that jump as hard as your making it look?
[rgamer0] @ Yeah that's the truth of Frog Legs
[adamx0315] @ @PBandJelly12 it's frame perfect
[rgamer0] @ Barely have any meat at all
[pierrezebub] @ also frog legs arent bad
[adamx0315] @ fried gator tail is pretty good
[pbandjelly12] @ @adamX0315 so yes thejma10Wazzzap
[rvpa] @ gotta get a thicc frog to enjoy it
[darkness3827] @ well as a species their deliciousness has prolly helped them survive but on an individual level yeah they get merc'd very early in life
[pierrezebub] @ misstar knows her worth
[themasterzelda] @ look 50$ in this economy is a lot
[pierrezebub] @ 50 red coins , which is 100 KEKW
[mirby_studios] @ is that an hourly rate
[pbandjelly12] @ for how many hours?
[rgamer0] @ One time purchase that you will regret
[pierrezebub] @ considering you can have mushrooms that brings you back to life for less , id argue 50 is alot
[pbandjelly12] @ Smited for being dumb
[oceanicthoughts] @ Something something folded like an omelet
[rgamer0] @ 50 bucks buys you a Yu-Gi-Oh deck and a side deck
[blacktiger51] @ for 50 bucks that deck must sucks
[rgamer0] @ Didn't have to say a meta deck
[blacktiger51] @ and that why you play master duel Kappa
[animatedelf] @ It's not cheap if you wanna be top
[oceanicthoughts] @ Yugioh is just the MtG of Pokemon
[witz2020] @ Magic on the other hand haha
[witz2020] @ my competitive Magic commander deck is $2k
[pbandjelly12] @ most stressful sleep music
[rgamer0] @ Yummy right now which is the current top meta deck in Yu-gi-oh TCG is like about 300 bucks
[animatedelf] @ IDK I was looking at a meta poke deck and it was like, 200
[animatedelf] @ I think it was gold
[animatedelf] @ Cause Garde used to be like 40 each
[animatedelf] @ maybe, I wasn't paying attention to that
[themasterzelda] @ tbh in PTCG because of the rarity levels most card aren't very expensives
[themasterzelda] @ like the priciest default card is around 5$ at most
[themasterzelda] @ it did go up with the pocket craze
[rgamer0] @ I only buy alt arts for cards because I like seeing the different artworks
[rgamer0] @ Not like there hasn't been good video games for me to spend on because they're all fall games
[darkness3827] @ yeah def not vanilla
[morpheus080] @ im continuing my playthrough of rebirth and ignoring every sidequest has made this game way more fun NiceSoftlock
[rgamer0] @ Such a thing as too much content
[themasterzelda] @ final fantasy side quests have never really been... good
[themasterzelda] @ if you ask me
[morpheus080] @ 90% of them im like, this is not why im playing this game
[mirby_studios] @ i enjoyed all of that in rebirth but i can see how it gets overwhelming
[venlafaxinequeen] @ It’s an Ubisoft game????
[themasterzelda] @ it was all downhill from there
[rvpa] @ hell yeah let's go
[mirby_studios] @ i didn't get into them until a few years ago so i missed the train when it started 20 years ago lmao
[themasterzelda] @ the name for this jump should be "the stupid jump"
[mirby_studios] @ and even then i haven't played that many
[morpheus080] @ like i dont even feel bad actively skipping all of this stuff, mainly cuz the original had significantly less of this bloat lol
[themasterzelda] @ @morpheus080 gotta bloat the game to justify being 3 individual games instead BatChest
[rvpa] @ woah i didn't know you could go that way LUL
[themasterzelda] @ i'd argue botw was a unique take on it that nothing managed to imitate
[morpheus080] @ lava puzzle skip my hated randomly
[mirby_studios] @ one of my favorite BotW memories is the treehouse live where bill trinen blew himself up with TNT barrels with aonuma there and he busted up laughing
[morpheus080] @ couldn't even bring myself to finish botw
[mirby_studios] @ blowing yourself up: universally funny
[themasterzelda] @ to me its the one game that managed to do open world in a way that was actually fun
[robinwings_] @ you saved him :D
[mirby_studios] @ this seed is trash
[morpheus080] @ insanely convenient place for him to be KEKW
[mirby_studios] @ we banished him to the pillar
[darkness3827] @ I mean idk like Mario 64 or any 3D zelda pre BotW is basically just a bunch of small open worlds stitched together so I don't really see much of a difference between them. Altho obv the bigger an area is the more empty it is gonna feel generally.
[pbandjelly12] @ surly this is logic LUL
[themasterzelda] @ @Darkness3827 full open world is extremely overrated if you ask me
[themasterzelda] @ very few games do it in a way that justify it
[themasterzelda] @ botw was one of them
[rgamer0] @ I think Tears of the Kingdom was supposed to be DLC for BotW
[mirby_studios] @ tears of the kingdom gave me what i never got from skyward sword: a satisfying amount of sky islands to explore
[morpheus080] @ i think the only really open world game i've enjoyed was fallout 3 and i played it once like 12yrs ago
[themasterzelda] @ also it kinda screw over a lot of what made botw botw to begin with
[themasterzelda] @ @Mirby_Studios im gonna be real, that was one of my biggest disappointment from totk
[themasterzelda] @ totk sky islands were too copy pasted
[morpheus080] @ yeah i would agree
[pbandjelly12] @ looks like someone payed the 50 coin rate
[darkness3827] @ Are they? They're very empty games.
[rgamer0] @ And that's why Misstar that you will never get bought
[mirby_studios] @ i mean fair but i'm still mad at skyward sword being all YOU CAN EXPLORE THE SKY and i expected something like wind waker where there was plenty to see there but there's like 10 islands and that's it lmao
[rgamer0] @ Rot in frozen jail for all time
[themasterzelda] @ tbh i had basically no exposure to SS advertisement so that wasn't a disappointment to me
[rgamer0] @ That's the big problem with Zelda games that are open world
[mirby_studios] @ i mean fair, i wasn't expecting the full on 49 islands to find but i did expect more than we got in SS lol
[rgamer0] @ It's just a big expanse of nothing
[themasterzelda] @ forsaken fortress 1 my behated
[darkness3827] @ I mean WW is essentially open world as well.
[themasterzelda] @ i have a mixed opinion
[morpheus080] @ i think MM is the only one that gets it right in that regard
[buff00n] @ When done right a small, concise world that gradually opens up is usually more engaging, imo
[themasterzelda] @ dungeons isn't inherently what makes a good zelda, but its a big factor
[rgamer0] @ Yeah I hate when they have forced things in the overworld to do
[themasterzelda] @ @Rgamer0 so you love twilight princess right? Kappa
[rgamer0] @ Like if it has some gear you need to progress that's fine
[rgamer0] @ I just don't like how the BotW series tries to be Fire Emblem at the same time
[themasterzelda] @ i like non-linear progression too, but most games just go full "NON-LINEAR? NO PROGRESSION"
[darkness3827] @ @buff00n Yeah and it's very hard to do that with an open world. The upside of open world tho is you have a lot more options.
[rgamer0] @ And the rewards in BotW and TotK sucked
[buff00n] @ Peach's Castle is a good example cuz for the start, you're teasing with a buncha stuff you can't access (star doors), or you have to realize you have access (Secret Slide, Coins in the Aquarium, Wing Cap)
[rgamer0] @ I enjoyed Echoes for what it was worth
[themasterzelda] @ to me the shrines were the reward in botw
[themasterzelda] @ in totk it was just annoying ultrahand """"puzzles""""
[mirby_studios] @ yeah echoes showed they remembered that they can put actual rewards behind sidequests lol
[buff00n] @ mind you, all that's in the first floor of the castle
[rgamer0] @ Though they could use more of a classic return to a more fixed gear set
[pbandjelly12] @ collecting all 999 koroks Was the reward B)
[rgamer0] @ Like I get it that Zelda as the protagonist can't play like Link
[morpheus080] @ what the hell was that
[morpheus080] @ that puzzle skip KEKW
[themasterzelda] @ heck even a link between world despite having the item renting shit did it mostly right
[buff00n] @ the BotW / TotK tablets aren't engaging enough to carry an game and breakable weapons isn't fun
[morpheus080] @ actual rando moment wth
[darkness3827] @ I mean personally I thought BotW did a really good job of slowly giving you access to more areas. Or at least as good as an open world game possibly could.
[buff00n] @ I liked ALttP too much to like ALBWs
[mariomantaw] @ It's JP-only in vanilla but was patched into rando
[themasterzelda] @ @buff00n personally i enjoy the breakable weapons, really feeds into the "the world is a post apocalyptic state and everything is disposable" feeling
[morpheus080] @ MM is prob the only zelda game where the dungeons aren't the highlight of the game and i prefer it that way
[morpheus080] @ everything else is a lot of fun to me
[buff00n] @ @TheMasterZelda I disliked it cuz I felt whatever I find wasn't worth breaking weapons, bows and using arrows
[morpheus080] @ i dont think other zeldas with that same design nail it like MM
[rvpa] @ giant's knife be like
[buff00n] @ I saved everything for mining ores cuz I got money which I could use for clothes, that didn't break
[rgamer0] @ Yeah with the Masks in MM I don't expect them all to have a use as a tool
[morpheus080] @ honestly finding out the master sword breaks and you have to let it recharge was probably what made me stop playing it
[themasterzelda] @ i understand but don't really agree, because you get way more weapons back. exception would be stuff like lynels that are just HP sponges
[rgamer0] @ It's kind of like the Echoes in Echoes of Wisdom in a sense
[morpheus080] @ cuz of what you just said
[darkness3827] @ yeah I mean I think it'd be a bit different if they didn't all break in like 3 hits. Like I didn't mind the durability mechanic anywhere near as much in TotK
[rgamer0] @ Again if I want to play a game with durability weapons Fire Emblem is that way
[themasterzelda] @ in totk they "fixed" the durability by making it so barely matter that it breaks the design
[buff00n] @ when I got Zora girl's spear and was told that shit would break, and I'd need to gather resources to make another one, I stopped caring about the Champions' gear
[themasterzelda] @ oh yea those weapons are shit
[themasterzelda] @ that's the weakest part of the mechanic
[buff00n] @ the weapon just EVAPORATING, rubs me the wrong way
[themasterzelda] @ one of the thing that makes it work to me is the mix of weapon breaking dealing more damage + weapon throwing
[themasterzelda] @ its satisfying to just yeet a weapon about to break at an enemy face
[pbandjelly12] @ minecraft weapon durability SeemsGood
[darkness3827] @ yeah same I think I threw a weapon once and then never again.
[themasterzelda] @ minecraft equipment durability is so ass lol
[buff00n] @ OOT had that shit figured out, you break the Giant's Knife and pay to fix it, or do the sidequest to get a Biggoron's Sword
[themasterzelda] @ they ruined it with enchantments
[themasterzelda] @ @buff00n ah yes the giant knife that can literally break in one hit
[themasterzelda] @ only people i've heard say that are people that never really engaged with the old style
[starry_arie] @ who up testin they seed
[venlafaxinequeen] @ Skyward Sword wasn’t 20 years ago
[morpheus080] @ that or the switch games were their first zelda games
[robinwings_] @ man not the skyward sword hate :(
[themasterzelda] @ its weird because im the type of person to not use consumables in jrpg until the very end, but somehow weapon durability is literally non issue to me in botw
[venlafaxinequeen] @ What about the Switch port?
[themasterzelda] @ actually i think the weapon durability is what makes botw work at all
[robinwings_] @ NOT THE CONTROLS HATE TOO... no im kidding i totally see that argument, i just never had issues with it ever
[themasterzelda] @ open world games have a major issue in general where you just find a really good weapon and then nothing you explore matter anymore
[mariomantaw] @ Only Zeldas I've played are WWHD, BotW, TotK and EoW (haven't finished). Don't mind BotW/TotK but I also haven't played many other open-world games of the style
[starry_arie] @ genuinely my issues with skyward sword are with the horrible pacing and specifically the motion controls for the water sections. they didn't bother me anywhere else
[darkness3827] @ @TheMasterZelda I mean that's all games idk how that's exclusive to open world ones.
[morpheus080] @ idr having issues with the controls when i played it but 14yrs ago i was 14 yrs old so NiceSoftlock
[morpheus080] @ i probably just put up with it and didn't realize
[themasterzelda] @ @Darkness3827 because other games normally its progressive, not "oh you found this one strong weapon cool"
[starry_arie] @ the water sections have you shaking the remote and holding it in weird directions a lot, very cringe
[darkness3827] @ open world games for the most part are progressive unless you're somehow able to take down like the hardest enemies in the game at like level 1 or whatever.
[themasterzelda] @ @Starry_Arie shake the nunchuk, not the wiimote
[themasterzelda] @ if it was the wiimote it would be the most dogshit controls ever
[robinwings_] @ Ik there's an option to turn off motion but i feel like that would make it worse imo?? I never tested it myself tho
[buff00n] @ @Starry_Arie I'm remembering how much I hated the Mermaid Suit in Ages
[starry_arie] @ it just wouldn't like... be a game without the motion controls. they were kinda the whole point. it falls apart without them
[themasterzelda] @ Skyward Sword would still be a good game without the motion controls, it just would need some pretty big changes... especially to the combat
[darkness3827] @ So it's Metroid Prime? LUL
[darkness3827] @ There should be some sort of bonus for equipping both P-Up D-Down and D-Up P-Down LUL
[themasterzelda] @ yea but the average player don't know how to do that
[themasterzelda] @ oot/mm/ww/tp players all struggle with that lol
[darkness3827] @ How are the motion controls for TP?
[themasterzelda] @ @Darkness3827 we don't talk about those
[themasterzelda] @ its the worst imo
[themasterzelda] @ literal just annoying motions
[buff00n] @ Best thing about SS was that dude doing front flips and backflips while playing the game
[darkness3827] @ All Sushie Glitches %
[themasterzelda] @ its like if mario galaxy made it so you had to shake the wiimote to jump instead of spin
[themasterzelda] @ its why i hate tp wii so much lol
[themasterzelda] @ also it was just basic motions, not motion+
[axl_sr] @ phantom help, Im testing platinum I had 20 checks, found the bike and it jumped to 155 phanto274S
[axl_sr] @ i dont rememberr the bike being that good
[buff00n] @ FIRMLY GRASP IT, STREAMER
[themasterzelda] @ i personally recommend the OG with a proper setup
[themasterzelda] @ technically if you have a wii u gamepad you can hack something up for smaller distance
[themasterzelda] @ wii u gamepad is closer range :D
[buff00n] @ " Mario HATES Ultra Boots. The red drives him crazy. "
[themasterzelda] @ wii u gamepad is about arm distance i'd say
[themasterzelda] @ it is however a bit annoying to setup
[themasterzelda] @ i haven't played HD so i can't comment on that
[themasterzelda] @ but i do know that switch 1 joycon gyro is not accurate enough for SS
[themasterzelda] @ according to Mondo switch 2 joycons are much better on that regard
[themasterzelda] @ the original motion+ did that with the sensor bar
[themasterzelda] @ its actually one of the only thing the game uses it for
[themasterzelda] @ yea i genuinely can't imagine pro controller controls being better unless you really can't use motions
[themasterzelda] @ well compared to wii
[themasterzelda] @ switch 1 motions are just NOPERS
[themasterzelda] @ its so easy on wii
[themasterzelda] @ you just.... swing the nunchuk along the wiimote
[themasterzelda] @ isn't there a button for rolling?
[themasterzelda] @ it should have been just that button + right stick direction.....
[themasterzelda] @ i love stick clicking (i don't)
[buff00n] @ fwiw, the only Zelda game I didn't mind Stamina was ABLWs. Everything else was annoying.
[themasterzelda] @ yea speedrun uses the stab a lot
[themasterzelda] @ i like stamina in SS because stamina is only ever used to go FASTER
[themasterzelda] @ and there's some level design with the stamina fruit placement
[themasterzelda] @ makes for interesting movement
[themasterzelda] @ and default running speed is already like, decent
[themasterzelda] @ botw totk stamina tho YEP
[themasterzelda] @ you think its bad in botw? they made it worse in totk
[themasterzelda] @ in botw you can still climb, with proper technique, you slip at a fixed rate
[themasterzelda] @ in totk its fuck you YEP
[witz2020] @ so, do you have to find all of the star spirits and star beam or are you given star beam upon completion of X number of chapters?
[0b1jc0b] @ but can't Yelshi be traded to the shopkeep?
[witz2020] @ odds the seed and beam are in Rowf's?
[0b1jc0b] @ yo - TMNT bros!
[witz2020] @ Donnie is definitely not the leader haha
[0b1jc0b] @ um, splinter is the main character?
[buff00n] @ Rise of the TMNT was actually VERY good
[witz2020] @ Ice Power in case of LP?
[witz2020] @ watch Yoshi/Vase be Magical Seed
[witz2020] @ What was that +1 to boots? Do the charge badges auto give boosts?
[themasterzelda] @ i heard "did i fuck this blooper"
[robinwings_] @ oh cmon you dot want Slow Go? Kappa
[themasterzelda] @ the council will decide
[witz2020] @ Are Koot favors turned on?
[angellove94] @ nevermind I didn’t miss all of stream! yay
[angellove94] @ MegaConsume that’s the emote I got yesterday
[themasterzelda] @ the star spirit black market
[blacktiger51] @ new plando idea all 6 in shop for 999 coins each Kappa
[themasterzelda] @ step 1 of progression is buying something at 999 coins Kappa
[blacktiger51] @ i should really work on my plando but way to lazy rn Deadge
[themasterzelda] @ with the single worst possible money farming
[themasterzelda] @ is there an area you can spawn in where you are fully stuck with no money farming?
[themasterzelda] @ asking for a friend
[themasterzelda] @ so the only money maker would be buy and resell :)
[themasterzelda] @ for 1 coin profit at a time
[blacktiger51] @ just beat kent at level 1 with only goombario Kappa
[themasterzelda] @ never let me make a plando
[themasterzelda] @ only 50k more points SMILERS
[themasterzelda] @ isn't that true for all events enemies?
[themasterzelda] @ koopatrol that drops the key
[themasterzelda] @ uh, that's weird then
[rgamer0] @ Send back bag, maybe get seed?
[rgamer0] @ Getting Bowser all sticky
[angellove94] @ time for me to go to sleep
[angellove94] @ goodnight phantom and chat. I have tomorrow off but I worked 10.5 hours today and I’m tired
[themasterzelda] @ you went back to get slow go
[themasterzelda] @ im a big fan of just dying
