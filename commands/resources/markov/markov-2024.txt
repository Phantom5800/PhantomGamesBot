omg i love kirby64 so much
i'm here for the kirby yeeting
*looks at the mess behind her* i mean i guess cleaning up is fine
i see it as more lived in than messy lmao
dragon fruit has been my addiction ever since I got it
I only remember from Brawl Dedede
Just left me scarred enough to fucking hate Kirby games
This game probably has the best selection of copy abilities
Even tho star allies is my favorite, I still love every single kirby game
He's gonna become an artist streamer
I think Adventure introduced that or Super Star I don't remember well
Cutter in DR3 and 64 is kinda bad by itself
how is it 100% if you dont get all the info cards Kappa
Just die, it turns into 01, and you win
is this your first kiirby speedrun?
the combine system is cool af
Can't wait for the dynamite level
I've always thought about running this but never have
One day Seasons will happen jaycFeels
I think the coolest ability is Cutter plus spark
i like bomb and cutter a lot - the ninja star haha
was it bomb and cutter or spark and cutter?
My personal favorite is Cutter+Bomb, with Ice+Spark being a close second
Very unfair and way too long
how did you enjoy rock + cutter? (the shape changer shard mission thing)
I feel you should've got a HP refill when Dedede took control
howd you get to dry dry ruins?
already at the start of the new yr ur now my fave streamer
world 2 in every game ever
Stone+Cutter is cool cause you only use pitch
oh this one is fun too
Ice+Fire is the best combine copy ability stickshamChaos
Isnt there that 1 level in fire planet(forgot the name)where you need double ice for a crystal star
Yeah, 2x of me sounds really fuckin toxic
ice cut is good too, ice skating I think?
Needle I feel in 64 has a ton of utility with all combinations
Doesn't save you from the 2 second timeouts
Is this run going on the youtubes?
it’s a weird room yes. one thing that helps with the jumps is if you’re running to the left before jumping, it allows for faster horizontal movement
oh def. this room ain’t easy. it was a TAS only trick for a while PrideLaugh
I forget lightbulb is an ability
Forgotten Land isn't a real game
Someone needs to make that an animated emote
I think Fire+Spark is funny but it's bad
fire+spark is my fav combo just for the animation PrideLaugh
Pix is such a strange boss
fuck, now you’re making me want to run this again lol
"Do you think Geoff has ever heard of Ghost Trick?" First reply is "he thinks its an indie game. KEKW
lol they had to get the last hit
How do you perfect frame that lol
like a frame or two later
Phantom, you should learn BM64 with me
new game, still shitty spear guy enemies
Perfect opportunity to do it then lol
the way I started remembering easy was with Curtis. when you get to the small waterfalls, count “1, 2, 3” in the lollipop owl voice and you’ll know exactly where it is PrideLaugh
28 means you purposely manipped rng to make it go further PrideLaugh
Strange parasol isn't in this game
so i take it this is fishing?
Yes Stavros this is adult fishing
Never knew this as a kid
i never knew about the fish :O
i never knew til I learned this run LOL
i only lifted them up like that for meat shield lol
Don't most enemies have a special property like that?
I would assume the spear guy is one of them?
if you want bomb for Acro, 2-4 in the beginning, the rocket enemy
also, did you know Acro spelled backwards is Oil Spill?
i mean technically by this game, this is your second fight LOL
I don’t remember this part of Sea World
yeahh, now the run is about to get fucking hard
Wdym, isn't that an everyday occurrence?
Why did it just let you drop like that?
I remember using the Bird and using to glide across
I just learned that Mother3 has a book of mario translation
but yeah, it’s still ridiculous how they have you do this
Don't you know, when you actually are speedrunning, nothing goes your way?
because you have to carry ice through the entire stage as well
hold up, YOU DOING CURLING STONE STRATS: 👀
it’s parasol, top hat, or pizza
parasol worst luck, pizza(?) for best luck
Is hat the best one to get?
i just know parasol is worst LOL
oh boy I hope it crashes!
yo did i hear vc crashes Pog
you can eat those rocks too
I guess we take that L
yeah, sparky’s a lil bitch in this level
yeah, that’s what I meant PrideLaugh
yeahh, you can moonwalk if you’d like
or climb up the stairs without your sprite moving LMAO
Fond memories of renting this game from Blockbuster
what's this I heard from the other side of my room about swallowing
good luck against the most terrifying bosses ever... a D20
It's so funny how ass burn kirby is in this game compared to every other LOL
nice you got fire at last
it’s pretty rare in general without manip
Why blud got a bandaid on his head who put that there
so fun thing about this fight, I believe you can use the L and R buttons as well
popesPOGGERS_HF minimi6Pog ghunzoEPOGna tippiPog popesPOGGERS_SG phanto274GG jcogGERSC qwilliPauggie jcogGERS
it’s one of those things you just have to try out, not during a run though
yeah, this game has a high technical skill level
this is kinda peaking my interest
it’s why I had to stop
hol up, kirby has a copy ability??
@JamminJami any of the swords or rock statues
some based kirby crystal shard gaming
as for my fave being a bomb and op fire fire(living comet)
Part of me wishes i actually learned this game
I was thinking about it like until manip came out and then stopped haha
Thats fair, for when you need a break from Rando?
Well... this ain't mario 🤔 phanto274GL
So I can redeem another pape rando?
damb did I miss the run
Okay I can't make them myself too many settings 🤣 but if I leave in notes is that fine again?
game overs are bad and unfair and never ever happen in this game
you say that as if majority of all artists don't do porn
Max rando no access to prologue or chapter 7. Cheap or low cost bp/fp badges etc and hopefully glitchless 😁
No rush I have a roof here to get fixed and clean up after that 🥴
I should see about porting Rock Star to MMR again
I had instruments and stuff figured out, just a matter of editing
It actually sounds super good in the MM soundfont
Kirby is the most talented nonbiney of all time
i remember this game being so hard
yeah it’s easy to do alongside the moonwalking
Everyone always says this game is so hard and I go ????
the final boss is no joke and some of the combo powerups are hard to figure out in places
but it may be one of those like
'I grew up with the game how can it be hard' deals
this game is medium strength at best it tests ur knowledge/skill/ platforming
from a speedrunning perspective I can absolutely see how this game is rough
eh, i can see how it would be hard for some.  I wouldnt say its hard as much as it can punish you for real for making mistakes
I enjoy him in theory but playing him is like running in Fatal Frame
Now I wanna play Kirby 64
*this* was the bastard piece for me growing up
I need a Kirby Jam emote tbh
all Kirby songs are pretty much bangers
The stage 2 forest theme sounded more like a Christmas tune
Me when I'm below u and my beak is pointy B>
happy new year! im doing good, i hope you are doing well
Hey I beat this recently jcogLurk
THAT'S how you get that shard??
to know that, you would literally have to play Kirby’s Dream Land 3
i transformed myself into a rock! I'm rocky rick!!
Maybe it's cause I played Ecco and Majora's Mask but it's more like widevibe than anything else
I’m glad they weren’t that evil at least LUL
IDT it's on this channel but it's a bunny moving with its arms back and forth
This level was eating my ass before
one of things off that pull starting off is not to jump off but go all the way down on the pole and then press right to let go
Second hardest in the game imo
I thought the fight would be over after that first phase
look, sometimes you just gotta fish with dynamite
well maybe the endangered species shouldn't have played fuck around and find out
They even attack bougie ships come on now
It was fun doing this without an ability afterward lol
people who cannot hold their breath or are mute cannot
or wait maybe it’s go all the way down the pole and then press down at the bottom. i can’t remember
The spiders are the worst sometimes
It doesn’t help that it takes so long to get too
yeah this is a real dangerous power up
esp given you can't really duck to bring out ur hard helmet
Rock bomb is the dynamite right?
I wanna put Kirby in my mouth and I hope he tastes like bubble gum
they gotta make the game last longer so....artificial padding
Considering this game can be finished without glitches in like 4-5 hours, yea
They clearly did it to force players to replay previous levels
Don’t talk about their balls like that
Yo, Phantom. Happy New Year, chat! nagPeepohappy
Just 30 more days of Kirby zfgSad
Bold of you to think I even pay attention
Can we get to part where I just teach you Luigi’s Mansion 100% instead? zfgSmug
I regret selling Luigi's Mansion 😔 But I had beat it so many times....
That reminds me weren't the waddles enemies?
All my homies hate Kirby zfgMad
I didn’t realize you could protect yourself from that
That ability is high key ass tho
watch out for the weaponized bird turds
I know there’s one in world 3?
when did you start Playing Super Metroid
Fire cutter probably the most fun ability imo
Is this game just annoying to run?
It'd be so fuckin hella if it was like 1.5x faster
Honestly that ability is down there just above dynamite for me LUL
Like, you’d think it would at least be fast
Hated this level just for the crystal shard at the end
This one in particular was really bad for me
man i just love the coolness of this lvl
really interested to see how a speedrun of this goes
this game is good and fair
It's basically those castles from Super Mario World
Died at least 5 or 6 times just to crushers
This game do have the banger music
@buff00n the run is fine to me
now you got me wanting to try a 100% speedrun of this too
learning which moves you need to get the gems
yeah, this run takes a ton of practice
interesting, yeah your right i wouldent of guessed that LUL
it’s one of, if not the most, technical Kirby games
Jacob's playing ash so he's the hero
i never would of guessed, i wanna do it just becaues i love this game LUL
oh god i DESPISE THIS BOSS
So fun fact. This boss is the reason I purchased this game on the Wii U eshop.
Endgame is upon us and Levias is epic!
Since I never beat it as a kid LUL
just got straight up DVD Screen'd
this boss always gives me such a hard time
It took me forever to beat this as a lad lol
I lost track of the sub goal someone help me remember
Sub goal met party time all!
what does the purple block thing do?
Hey its void- I mean 02
I was obsessed with the mini games tho
and star rail just railed me again Sadge
Yes bc all biblically accurate angels have giant green spikey dicks
wait we did not hit the sub goal?
honestly no one cares for any% LOL
Whispy will still be the same. outside of that I’m not sure
Yo somebody gifted me a sub earlier, THANK YOU
I was going to prime when I got mine lol but grateful for the sub @str9ngest9r monadoHug
Double fire all the way across the sky
yknow double fire being the speedrun move of choice makes sense LUL
iirc it’s faster a bit to single fire this run, but you also don’t wnt dead hands PrideLaugh
Yo thanks for the gift sub @LordLevias19 ! phanto274Jam
Kirby squeak squad was a really good game
I love getting Wegmans muffins. Blueberry and their Doble chocolate are my go tos
Kirby air ride was great as well
some muffins has chocolate that tastes like ink
It's a grocery chain in select areas of the ne.
have you tried honkai star rail yet?
double fire so op beyond belief jaye
Also Im very annoyed bc Ive been trying to do my fafsa for the past week and the site has been in maintenance this whole week
I'm a ny local and it's my fave store, but I don't drive and can only go if a friend takes me. So I usually end up walking to dollar general
Oh, thanks for the sub mossro1Popop phanto274BLANKIES
Not me dying to the first pillar on this level monadoPAUSE
Are there any differences aside from the crystal shards?
Is there a run that requires all the cards?
oh that would be diabolical KEKW
people have done true 100% before. collecting all the cards doesn’t take too long
but it’s more rare I believe
What do the cards even do?
when I did it, I got mostly new ones
and you’ll know if it’s new or not because Kirby reacts differently
what the name of this boss fight again
the dp off the reflector was OD
honestly do not blame you lol
kirby kills everyone whos stands in his way rionavKnife
and he gets praised for it
Wordle 926 4/6*  ⬛🟨🟨⬛⬛ ⬛🟨⬛⬛🟨 🟩⬛🟩🟩⬛ 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
here comes kirby reigning fiery vengeance
you're getting gold splits, that's all that matters Kappa
"Player 2 FINALLY takes a round!" rub it in, asshole
i'm pretty sure this is the type of game where you can get a good time w/ mostly game knowledge alone
Kirby, master of the good ol suck-n-swallow
i love this cute little guy
Kirby how would you like it if someone broke into your house n throws bombs on you
he's just trying to cook you up
I tried out the demo of this, terry is really fun to play. I was getting excited doing quarter circles with my fight stick lol
submit them and then come back after you've got a wr and compare xD
I was like, I get now, I know why people use fight sticks
it's like learning taxes for the first time
i liked the grind for manips in Pokemon but i don't know that i'd want to do that for multiple games :)
just need to get that ace any% skip down
at least it's not arbitrary ;)
Couldn't learn how to consistently grab but when it happened I'd pop off lol
I learned a couple of alttp glitches for an any% and then decided i didn't like the speedrun
i like the music in this game - wonder why i've never ran it before
the boss that can crash on runs
I love the random witch just chillin in hte bg
I don't know what that game is
You're not doing enough Brian Copters
i hated this level as a kid lol
That crusher can eat my ass
It’s mainly getting crushed on the corners that’s triggering
It kinda sucks you can’t guard in this game
I couldn’t tell if you just walked into it or not
I'm not gonna be playing SMRPG for a while. Gotta derust CV3
Yeah, I didn't read much lmao
We also now fight Dodo KEKW
I'll let them cook on that for a couple weeks
They got rid of jump shoes johnny at least
Oh so, I think we're just gonna roll with 5 people in the room
And maybe not do the upgrade
I think it's a standard double room
This is my favorite track in the game
Hotel cost is looking around 308ish if I calc'd tax right
why hotel bunk in with a local gamer
Kirby still cosplaying Pikachu from Smash Bros on the 64
'rude ass pix' me yelling about my art in the bg'
when does the rng manip start :)
had a funny moment at work early
customer was trying to opt out of text messages but all they sent was "stop fucking"
i'm ace i'm way ahead of you
i love that stone kine is literally useless
like he doesn't even get "swim slowly"
her leg really just went through najd's little poke
i need to remember really funny things can happen to athena when far d whiffs
its still not a great far c
i just didnt know it was cancelable lmao
I'm now inside so i can actually watch
we are clawing our way back
with how often yurikov does missed light confirm>oops i'll throw now i really should be mashing on hit more (it works against us every time so why wouldn't he lmao)
bind the touchpad to roll tho
keep 2 hands on the wheel at all times
Also I'm unsure if it's my end or not, my net looks fine but stream has been stuttery
we gotta get more sand characters in FGs. Kukri is dope
we gotta get more sand characters in Butts. Kukbutt is dope
we gotta get more sand in my butt
does his pillow have a name?
This is the level where I got pissed at the game
Keep in mind I was like 6 years old at the time
What if you made Brian Copter an emote?
small character easy link lets go
I thought you had some save in World 6
A death in 5-3, lost some power up in 6
but hes probably gonna do kyo k iori
he do be throwing it back
hmm maybe this ggy knows how to kof
the athena timeouts we're nasty tho
what am i even looking at lmao
Kooper and goombario got your back?  well this is over already lol
can you get back to toad town?
LUL what is happening?!? also hi also also gl
unfortunately many adults would do that LOL
so is this a full on mod or just like a small game?
is the toad who you trade candy stars with?
did 54 attempts at jr troopa segment and finally got a 3:22
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
Maybe the crying animation is weirdly long on console or something
what in the fuck is the grass
I like that a lot LOL
all these misses make me think it’s the opposite of master quest Kappa
Twitch took my money yesterday, but I couldn't send this message until today
I mean, you also could cheat
I feel like I back seated when I shouldn't have LUL
ummm excuse me… this isn’t the sewers
What's so "sweet" about this expedition
but he has no ears 🤔
Man that was a touching finale.
Can you hit it from below?
the dev is calling it shit NODDERS
Now I will finish you you bitch swifSleep
One of these days this account will be banned I swear KEKW
That much stop time is also too much
What was your first run btw? Just curious
What did they find this time now
And it also depends on how much you save
Because if it's like 20s just, no
I'd say don't change it KEKW too much hassle
Yeah because resources change and you need a new management and command chain
Remind me to bother you about mcr shit if I get curious
this music makes me want to march tho
well i was talking about the jungle music :)
sounds like one of the mana franchise tho
I miss the cow already Sadge
i suppose they can have their opinion lol
Last time I had that kind of comment I bothered the fuck outta them doing it
I have rolling muscle memory embedded into my brain
And if you say stop glitching you know what happens next phanto274Smile
I don't always pay super close attention to Zelda randos but did I choose a reasonable pred?
It's around the same time frame my randos get bomb bag or bow so swifLove you good
I know both can happen where you go forever without a sword or get a bunch up-front
You do in fact have a bunch of non-sword key items already though so we'll see
getting it done the right way
you like it that much huh
hey! the rando I woted on today. Cant be mad if it loses the poll now LUL
how was pape? saw I missed the first hour and a half and didnt want to tune in then
partner with poison status sounds cool
well thats all I know LUL
but do you have dance unlocked?
I knew id forget so thats why I sent it
At least you won't run out of bombs any time soon now.
I'm just waiting for your one of your next few checks to be another sword upgrade.
That would be just my luck. Personally. XD
This seed really wants you to blow stuff up, apparently.
I want my bs hamtaro speedrun
Now I'm thirsty for a soda pop, brb.
The good news in a race, everyone would have to come back here eventually, not just you.
Does that mean we aren't out of logic anymore?
I don't know this game as well as some others. XD
It would have been really gross if that was where flippers was.
Personally, I never actually compete in races, but I do sometimes do race seeds on my own just for fun.
I couldn't handle the pressure in an actual race though.
Link is a healthy boy this seed.
twas good! i'm quite liking it
You should celebrate when you move in by leaving your dishes out and getting a dog
and it's got music up there with dark souls 3
It's weird cause I've never gotten into the actual SoulsBorn games but between Lies of P and Star Wars Jedi I have been interested in quite a few games of that style. It's weird.
i still need to get jedi survivor
i love each and every boss in the dark souls game. I only made a tier list for Elden Ring
I've even took a good look at Elden Ring a few times
Lies of P my fave is Metal Knight Jester Giant.
i enjoyed elden ring until the end game
yeah, everything post leyndell were painful
1. Dragon armed (forgot spelling) 2. Ghost Lion Man (forgot spelling again) 3. Enchanted Mega deer (cant spell)
That caterpillar sounded like a Pokemon trainer humping a wall
Honorable mention with the twin aspect is the golden duo both (fat and skinny)
I made it with ground beef and diced mushrooms
I mean seasoning is important so it doesn't taste like shit or bland
I think beef (or steak chunks) and shrooms works causes the meat ends up overpowering the mushrooms most of the time
mushrooms and onions over shadow meats.
Phantom if I purchased lethal company for you would you play it with me and proc
that's better then we'll die together
how fast will we swing today
but it could be your dollar
as long as i don't need to specify the use of the bomb
Avoiding Castor Wilds at all costs.
Something tells me the shop lady is holding this seed hostage.
I wonder what the thumbnail will be this time? So many things it could be. XD
Once it's worthy you'll get the other
do you have a final goal in mind for this game?
what are times like on snes?
yeah, was curious how close they are
we are set to rock this
at least jp bn runners dont include credits LUL
btw the answer to your question from the other day, only JP version of Pape does watt do extra damage in lava
well that's something to enter during lol
GL with run yo, im bout to start spm any% PB attempts
I beat the fnaf thing I was doing last night
I have been attempting the hardest challenge in the game and I havent even got past the 1st 20 seconds
50/20 mode in UCN, you need inhuman levels of reaction time and patients
One of the fuckers lingers in the office and my mouse goes over it for 0.8 seconds I lose
customer comes in, asks if a question is grammatically correct, i confirm it is and ask if they have any product-related questions. they then ask me a prompt to write their landing page about one thing but also mentioning another
so i explain what i'm actually there for, ask again if there's product-related questions i can assist with
and then they ask "are you a real person"
i respond that yes i am indeed a real person
and they say "oh my bad I thought you were an AI"
an N64 controller would be great to use for emulating Wonderswan, since that has effectively 2 D-pads and then 2 face buttons
you mean you never played the LEGENDARY EXE GAME?!?
you mean you don't wanna play BATTLE CHIP CHALLENGE but WORSE?!?
seriously tho BCC is based on N1 Battle, BCC fixed up a LOT of things
BCC isn't that bad honestly, could be better but it's neat. there is the Chip Control Mod now
which makes it even more fun
instead of it being RNG which route is taken you get to actually choose that route
but yeah looking at N1 battle...
Dang, Osu is such a  good game
you only get Lan's story, there's 108 chips total, only 20 navis, no Slot In, chips go based on speed instead of selection order, rows are reversed, and no panel changing
so if you set your folder a certain way those chips will always go in that way, which is kinda boring lmao
geno where the fuck were you standing to fall like that
Look at this boss, button mashing!
I hope you like dumb jokes because I'm full of them
no i want you to run the game with even OLDER strats, play the game like it's the SNES original Kappa
no not play the game on snes, play the remake as if it is the same speedrun as the snes one
why does that house have a turbine attached to it
i don't see power lines in the mushroom kingdom!
Yo Phantom, gl with the new route!
Tiny Master Chief could fit in this game's aesthetic
Have you tried not having a 5 turn fight?
Oh you do fake chomp over hurly?
I guess it just takes too much time to unlock real chomp and too much money to get hurly gloves
Just use that money on margs
(all compared to the time those weapons would save)
Twitch is weird and messing up my anniversaries but anyways hello phanto274Smile
Oh it didn't even play the alert phanto274Lurk
That sounds like a lame place to reset too
The cake is bad enough too
This song is gonna be burned in my brain
I mean, I'd join you for the BN2 rando
I wouldn't suggest it without joining phanto274Smile
I can't believe you'd hurt me like this
That's what the dollar sign is for
something like A$1 means "keep it in column A"
and B$3$ means "keep it on cell B3"
oh, I forgot the dollar sign needs to be before the column letter or row number
Baja blast is only available at Walmart near me, and I'll be damned if I go to Walmart jsrSad
bring the walmart onto your property
Delivery around here is like another 13 dollars
no moar Baja Blast at Taco Bell, or is it more like no Taco Bell nearby either
Nah it's 20th anniversary of it, so it's available to purchase all of 2024
You just gotta go to walmart apparently
Which I'd rather snap my ankle in 20 places before I set foot into a walmart
closest baja blast to me is a dollar general on the highway
it's one of the newer dollar generals too
Closest dollar general to me is in the bad part of town phanto274Smile
(For reference, I live in New Orleans)
yeah thst's a dont go there for sure
unless it's also an iffy walmart
You could always grab the 50 chest before shaman skip
If you're short coins for nimbus
Do me a favor, go to 2-1 for me
Mf the only Kirby game you play
Nintendo was putting health and safety warnings on all their games but it wasnt enough to keep a generation from becoming myopic losers with all sorts of health issues
Do you do any of the glitches?
No the heck way my fave game of all all alll time!
Want me to teach you super jumps?
I can show you at GDQ
I have a 1:03 in this game lmao
Goomba surfing ruined the run for me phanto274Smile
i know how to get to 8th dungeon without mirror shield and get the key to the 3rd dungeon without doing the side quest
The best opening of any video game
you sure this hard logic? Analyze
This game, seasons and ages are just so fucking good
God damn you're gonna be in go mode in like 10 minutes
ok so this looking like very easy logic to me
I feel embarrassed to say I didn't play this game until it got ported to switch
i played this all the time back on my gameboy sp
i don't think i had the og gameboy version
It was GB for LA, GBC for LADX, and Switch
gameboy color version had boomerang and the color dungeon
Not a glitch, but it's a trick
Oh maybe you can enter D2
i left and came back and we are kirby in zelda? lol nice
you can tell this is an old kirby game because he doesn't have a hat with sword
I like the pac man noise when you fall into a pit
You can't pit walk that far
so what dumb settings did you choose for this
Oh I looked away and you got powder. How'd you do it
I'll take your word for it Kappa
it take you to the start of the game
try it maybe i am wrong haven't played this in year
yes L and R. two buttons known for being on the GB
it's A B Start Select on the main screen
Can't you lift signs in this game with power bracelet?
Rip. Another change added in seasons/ages
I know in seasons, you got a ring for breaking so many signs LUL
flying rooster is just an item in this i love it
okay now get Cutter and ride Coo, you'll kill everything
Maybe click bow wow a few times?
but you can't use him in dungeons so
who let kirby have a sword
this went from goish to struggle in a matter of minutes
You can dash into him with sword
what if this guy have the feather
i can see this for hard logic but not normal logic tf
heck, maddy put our I Can't Feel My Face pepper flake blend in the spaghetti sauce
WAS THAT A CHEST FROM D4
the flower is for the hippo in animal village iirc
last time i play this game i didn't do the trade quest
I'm trying to think what else you have open
Try and do the yellow things that aren't in dungeons
isn't bee hive guy north here
You can use the bird to fly over the swimming spot
And gain access to the Eagle Key spot
What do you need a bomb for
Or mambo's brings you to Crazy Tracys
All you have to do is enter the screen
With the teleporters and it unlocks them
You can also go up the stairs
That leads to the cave with the Eagle Key
i had a seed where it expected me to owl everywhere so many places
There's an item in this cave
so i know exactly what you can do with it
you can get almost to turtle rock with the owl
also i'm so used to seeing coo already i'm calling the rooster the owl lmfao
How many seashells do you have
iirc there's a cave under those rocks
I'm trying to see what I can figure out
is it one of the rocks i was trying to point out lol
The cave you're talking mirby is a mad batter
yeah but that cuold be something
You have rooster so you can float to it
Are mad batters in logic too?
Cause the chest you opened on the west side
i think they got bow wow from a mad batter
Can you send me a screenshot of your map?
So I can see what you've checked
you can bomb the bottom wall in this room but it's just rupees as we saw
i know you don't have bombs right now
this is a spot i ALWAYS forget about (it's a piece of heart in vanilla)
also the flower goes to a hippo in a house in animal village
Oh and the yellow box at the bottom
You can fly the rooster too
It'll bring you straight to Richard's villa
I think he takes the hibiscus
u got to be shitting me
If you wanna do one of these at GDQ, I can show you stuff
idk what's up with the tracker
Do you need the 5 leaves in this?
So you set a respawn point
Better hope you get instrument room
alright we schmoving and gettin  on now
Well. You found the beak last. Wonder what the owl says LUL
The hitbox on the final boss slime
That's gonna have most checks, yeah
High chance you'll find a dungeon key there
It's 15 shells for the koholint sword, I think
Oh you found the secret zelda portion of Kirby 64, most people don't know about it
carolina reaper, moruga scorpion, ghost pepper, and habanero flake blend
You have to push the graves a specific way
5th grave down, 4th grave left, 1st grave up, 2nd grave right, 3rd grave up
It didn't space my numbers lmao
ice it's your favorite dungeon theme
hit them throw in right hole
that's to the quadruplets in mabe
Okay that goes to the baby in mabe
All you get is a bag of "stuff"
I wonder what's gonna be in the arcade this time at GDQ
What trade quest items do you have
also no lie if u chose red tunic after the boss I would unfollow. KEKW so they were randoed as well.
That opens up quite a few checks
The last item in Dick's Villa
Me and that Walrus are one and the same
Bomb the north wall in the fall room
Wish I could bomb a wall and find 50 bucks
i am very sick and looking for fun vibes. am i in the right place?
There's a bomb wall on the east wall
okay ill be holding you to that. if kirby dies im holding you personally responsible
i'd probably also drop my bong if you killed me though
Mine is a rare drop aspen
You gotta kill me multiple times
hope u've got some lives saved up then
I got somewhere between 6 and 9 of them
Using 5 of them at AGDQ
All that does is let you read the books in the library lol
The rando didn't change it to 1 leaf
Yeah remember that cave you went too on the far right?
Oh yeah you have red tunic
what the fuck you don't have PoP
It's all the same item LUL
You only gotta open 1 box
Sure wish I could duplicate 50 dollars
i want the key to the $50 room.........
back to the south part of the map
what the fuck is this rando
Yo he's walking on water kirby is god
Well now you have TONS to do
Kirby in the water kinda looks like a Kabuto
I need to go fishing where he's fishing
where are these quest npcs in real life?
I THINK THEY TOOK MORE THAN THE NECKLACE LADY
u are kirby can't u just float over it
i guess you'll just have to tape them to your body to kill enemies that run into ut hem
Did you get the very first chest
The hookshot one in room 2
You have no more chests lol
i dont think that revenge was what he had in mind
if that's his idea of revenge. im going to get a job at his favorite diner and spit in his soup
I wish someone would revenge that on me
all that for some dog food
u could also give it to ice it sounds like
what's ur quest reward for the dog food turn in?
no i mean the reward ice would give u
I would Ara Ara in your ear
There's a heart piece in the water
It's the guy up there that says he's tired and needs "vittles"
So he can throw it away instead of putting it on pizza
well you can full clear it with pb2
You're getting violated by this seed lmao
You gonna be able to make it to GDQ?
"I hear Phantom finally found the eagle key"
You should be able to stun them with Hook
So let me teach you a trick
Clip 1 pixel into the wall by walking as close as possible to the wall but enough so link can still walk
Then Feather and face into the wall at the same time then at the apex of the jump, press the opposite direction
Wow look at all those dollars you have
I have sleepy time medicine and chocolate
Jump and push into the wall then immediately press the other direction
At the apex press the other direction
So at the very top of the jump press left
I think when you initially jump you should be pushing into the wall
Then at the top of it change directions
Why is lmao censored on mobile???
Does twitch think I'm like.  9?
I just got the mulldozer clip on youtube LUL
First kirby64 now I see you running Kirby's Other Dream Land... You know, cause Link's Awakening is a dream... tough crowd phanto274Shrug
Ill be disappointed if you didnt name your file Kirby
Then at the top of the jump
Slash and press the other direction
The slash and other direction are the same frame
You just did it, but the statue pushed you lmao
Try maybe a bit before you reach the highest apex
You can jump over obstacles in dungeons with it
Okay so it's fast inputs when you do it
It basically tricks the game into thinking link is on a ledge
You can't clip into that though
Clip into the wall, jump and push into the wall itself, then once link gets close to the top, slash and press the opposite direction at the same time
I keep thinking it's super late for you, but it's like 10pm lol
Oh btw, if you wanna save quit to warp back to the front of dungeons
Should also have a home warp
If you press down twice I think
yo ice, did you heard BN LC is finally getting added to the leader board KEKW
what happens if you run out of bombs in this room?
2024 is truly a great year
I think the save quit menu also has a hidden option
phantom, I saw the funniest suggestion in the discord. Make volume 1 one game and volume 2 another game OMEGALUL
And the room north of the staircase exit
Oh they actually added the home option
When I last played it was an invisible menu LOL
It turns the anti fairys into fairies
You have d1 and d4 now
So in the speedrun we use the super jump
I'm lying to you in cold blood
when is Kirby in TMC rando?
are instruments added to the pool?
oh dang, I just noticed the timer
does switch verrsion have a rando too?
that would prob be my only reason to get a mig switch
the shark boss from kirby 64
I expected kirby to fly in on his warp star there KEKW
There's 9 fucking keys here wtf
you can super jump that block
Slash and face the other direction at the same time
these salsa verde doritos are fire
Since when is a Zelda rando generous
I've also heard this was one of the fun but as you're experiencing, potential to be hell
I've said it before, one thing is knowing the game and another knowing the logic
Oh I know, I loved tmc boots
Letter is the house right after woods
She just admitted to robbing a bank
My favorite pile of shit dungeon
Pls use magic rod it's op
You have the KNOB of destiny
I'm so stoked, I thought I needed to buy more pairs of pants for AGDQ cause I could only find 2 pairs
I went digging in the closet and found 3 more pairs that fit me
Ayyy you know the speed strats lmao
have a good night guys, 2am is my limit lol
will you be playing this hard logic again?
you need a jailbreak switch right
link looking kinda different in this game asachiTweethinks
i got subchips for half off
if you have BN2 in the GBA slot (or the game tricked into thinking you do via codes) you unlock a special subchip shop which sells FullEnrg, Unlocker, and LocEnemy chips for half off
game even says it's because subchips started in BN2
You can technically damage boost through the fire
If you clip into the left wall
Kinda like how you do a super jump
Just clip in, and dash up
Hard logic probably allows for the damage boost
Yeah but you gotta clip at the bottom of it
You don't need to dash this screen
just get a potion and die up there
i always do 8 before 7
hope so i should be in Bedge rn
Cover the whole floor for a chest there
@Iceblue i was thinking that but wasn't sure been years since i played this
how nice of that hinox to throw you at the exit
trendy game was in the entrance to eagle tower
how many points to make you do full er and key sanity?
i am close to half a mil points
You have to go read it
thought it was static til you looked
In rando? I don't think it is
dear lord all those long-ass times we got on jay's command just came true here, ice
btw i had a funny moment of exiting a battle before the voice clip finished so i had the effect of colonel going YOU ARE SKI
its 3 am i hope its not another run
good job phantom YOU ARE SKI
phantom question for you. who the fuck would use a LongSwrd E
fuck no, thursdays are my day off
it's not friday till i go to bed
i misspoke, it was a LongBlde E
Which is Quest 64, but on GB
yeah i learned about that looking at the retroachievements games, ice
i was like WAIT THERE'S QUEST 64 GB??!?
Do we have a redo of last night here?
i gotta try one of these one day
ive only every played ladx like once though lol
Yo there's easier settings for Phantom?
Is there still a pit jump?
So we doing an entrance rando at GDQ?
No bring back Pokémon BR, put it on the switch
It's not like I'm sleeping anyway
i see that ice is also a gacha enjoyer
Nah just your average runescape enjoyer blacktiger
What a time to come home with dinner
@Iceblue i see envi does have nice emotes tho
Did the rando have a quality downgrade or What ? (Kidding, I only played the Switch Version)
I've been subbed to envi since he had like 20k followers lmao
doesn't he have like 300k now
"Subscribed to Enviosity for 87 months with a current streak of 87 month."
I love paying the ultimate price
87 months damn i found out about him in 2020 cuz you know genshin
I also play genshin now lmao
is this the only zelda game where you can steal lol
Majora's Mask you could also steal
@Iceblue can i add you on genshin? i can help you out if u need it
You steal rupees and a hotel room from a goron lol
his fault for having the same name as you though
I'll post my UID in phantom's discord in the gaming channel
Identity theft is a bigger crime than robbery
i really should get back to adding people lol
I primarily play runescape, but i do log into genshin sometimes too
ok @Iceblue i added you if u ever need help hit me up
No way in a dungeon in UNDER 5 MINUTES
Oh sweet, Song of Soaring Kappa
Is this palutena or an I trippin
If I'm dumb just say so
Who let the bot write for the randomizer? KEKW
I think LASW would've been a better remake if they did more outside of a few QoLs and funny dungeon maker
see phantom just found you that's how nuts you are
hit the switch while you're on top of the blue buttons
NOTED logic for this game is kinda dumb
i can't believe ice just murdered phantom
Shovel only work season and ages
Tiny Doritos are cute and tasty. Just a little PSA
Oooo this is a different tracker from last night
Based on last night's run, seems like that map was a pile of asses
Ugh, this was something LASW did right, put Power Bracelet and Boots on their own button
Damn I haven't played audiosurf in years
song is too short to medal
I used to love getting baked and playing audiosurf
i once did a full 40 minute long song in audiosurf too
You are too op early on with the rod
Where you literally lag the game so bad, bosses don't spawn
I'd like to get a body door installed in my house
i mean he's just borgar so eat him
I'm assuming OG rod is like Hard ore for seasons? @iceblue LUL
No it does the same thing here
The game wasn't built to handle the sprite limit
So the game just mega lags with the fire rod shots on screen
And the lag is so bad the bosses just don't spawn
And you walk to the instrument rooms LUL
Make a puka shell necklace phanto274Thonk
At this rate make some ear rings as well
im back with pizza how is X doing?
i didn't know about the color dungeon till the remake came out
btw, if you're ever low on hearts
that has to feel good after last night
yes it's been stuck in my mind for 30 years
i love how the gator eats the dog food can and all
enjoyed the vod and i saw u chose red
Let the routing and thinking begin
Apparently the tracker is on top of the raid alert
talking about why big streamers ignore small streamers
Link’s Awakening with lots of Mario references
The color dungeon was the DX secret dungeon ? I think
Lots of keys and lots of maps
its not like you need a red tunic with a magic rod
Hmm idk where the switch is
you just got that necklace frm the last dungeon right?
why is a fish in an egg on a mountain?
@venturific i think in my mind its not an egg but a skull.
with the dots being blood stains. and the true maze of evil.
@stavros12c34anenoglou but then why is it in a skull? whoevers dream this is they are fed up!!
Well seeing as how this is my N1 FortOne popesOne_TK Zelda game in history i have my own head canon.

i am liking watching this rando
oh yeah agdq is soon LETSGO
i voted for pokemon early this week
honestly i think you should play what you want, i was the one who just voted and i could watch any of them
my dad was watching you play the zelda rando
he doesn’t use youtube for that stuff lol
i cant believe it im a mon!
fun fact I nicknamed my vehicle Black Pearl.
so this is kinda fitting me being a pirate fan as well
Y'all ever just sit around and eat way more pineapple than you should
literally me last night liquid lol
@str9ngest9r I'm being absurd right now. I've eaten almost a whole pineapple. But even better, from the comfort of my bed LUL
You cant just say Lugia doesn't have any rizz like that
Also I was looking back through the food posts in discord because I'm weird. But I appreciate you bc you use hexclad cookware
I would get some but MAN are they pricey
I just use a generic non stick pan, but it works surprisingly well for 40$
People fuck up by using metal utensils when cooking stuff
Forks, knives etc in the pan
swift start is a worrisome endish
I think I say this every time I watch a crystal playthrough, but this OST is probably one of my favorites
Yeah he's got balls for ya
Slugma used to look so bad hahahahaha
Not the Eevee I wouldve chose but its fine
Well this isn't the mario rando I redeemed Sadge but phanto274GL
Which is Monday for me and I have a plasterer coming to rip out a room and redo Madge
If only they were chicken nuggets
It got flooded bad on new years 🥴 after being hit by tornado like storms christmas day
Damn now we have to watch out for flying clams??
liquid is now a water dragon!
FUCK yes. I'm a shining sea serpent
oh shit am I the Vioplume? I didnt even notice
Can key items end up in GAMBA ?
Probably for the best it's not default LUL
yt to a comment I posted - "YOU KNOW I HATE GENO AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY BECAUSE GENO IS A REAL BADASS:
wow, rando loves loading up enemies w/ electric moves whenever you run a flying type
something about Pallos being a Lass is just... correct
This moltres really wanted to fuse with his triplets.
I think I have the first one wrong tho
Have we seen any of that pokemon this one?
the one that evolves from rhyhorn?
remember that video of some russian guy beating up a store manager because they wouldnt let him park his bike inside
I'm starting a mission this year to collect EVERY tyranitar pokemon card
how much of that can be done in a single amazon cart
dang this new generation of card shop owners be SLACKING
I would be too if I evolved into a card shop owner
I'm probably going to be doing most of my buying from either TCG player or local shops
that gym was great it was full of women
Amazon only has like 15 tyranitar cards
I'd like to start at the oldest and work my way to the newest which starts me in Neo destiny era
second page has a few more it might be more like 20-25 from amazon.
But how reliable is my only question
I've been scammed on Amazon before sadly
I had a phase where I was buying MTG cards from Amazon and didn't get scammed once.
Hm. May have to look into it
I bought all the joke cards and showed my friends
The one that you rip up and throw on the play mat to deal damage.
Waterfall became so based and so useful with the phys special split
I mean you can't say you didn't call it
you gonna go catch the ho oh or what
It was trying times back then
would you prefer a flavorful, custom sound effect for waterfall..... or Ktanto
Ho oh is gonna be something dumb
ho oh will be a sunflora
we know that for sure from the cries?
I just got fuckin coconut malled
i think we will be elitefourable
I think moltres can already beat lance's ass
that charmander has CUrious BONE syndrome
i dont want to explain lickitung
have you checked the berserk gene
hey kid take this soft sand....
Ur clamming up my style in this wind
Keep it interesting I'm tuning in from the shower LUL
Are we about to witness a clean sweep
have you glitched into the safari zone
I watched this LIVE ON TWITCH
I've been voting on this one and apparently the first time you played was one of the only streams I missed
Have the VOD queued to watch at some point but haven't gotten to it yet
gonna be heading out in a bit, so I'll be lruking
We're gonna be here a while phanto274BLANKIES
I clicked first, did I get scammed?
had to interrupt myself with a brief shovelling
suprise ur speed running the remake isnt it better
but u still speedrun the exact same way right
or u just like the randomizser
there really is no competition nor comparison with this and the remake unlike oot and mm on 3d. Its just taste
Bot how much anger do you have to eat fuzzies?
I love the star dance DinoDance MegaManDance DinoDance MegaManDance
Couldn't find one easily, maybe I could make one
Mario RPG with the worse graphics
GL on the rest of the run!
lol it puts mallow over mario so you've got two mallows, i didn't notice that until now
it really do be super mallow rpg
watch the work pants are at tadpole lake and the tenor card just saved the run
at an open bar, got any mixed drink recommendations?
I've asked for a long Island and a sour whiskey thua far and they haven't said no yet
Beautiful a glass cannon to someone who already was made of glass
I'm actually almost halfway done with it I only need to find the last star
It's not going to figure out how to get the train and saying it's needs repaired
You know I think about it yes
Why is there somebody over there in the volcano
I already got the red star piece
No I totally forgot about that
I got my Mario level 23
I think the remake is way better
The original with Bowser's face looks ugly
Am found his parents right now
Found them and you was right
It looks like you hate that room
That's what Gino looks like in the original
All right I  in Bowser's key
All of them scared of me cuz I'm too strong for them
Yeah I did not see that coming
I have to say that game for tomorrow
I have to play it tomorrow
OMG what a breaking news this is. It seems as though there are beings stronger than zeno and DB will get a 10 yr arc!
just got back from cleaning my ps5
time to look over enviro4Notes jcogNote minimi6Notes tippiNotes
this is my fave fire dragon boss for a reason
jinx fight looks like hot garbage ass
HOLD up 30% to insta kill
your frustration is how i feel about this game all too often
@DrBarber88 Rando makes u tippiThink jcogThink
Is this rando new or something?
Oh okay. Yeah sounds like your screwed
probably that one secret boss that you don't see very often ;)
does frogfucius maybe trigger the star hill star? I imagine you've probably done that already though
does this mean that the feather can't be anything?
oh garrow just lets you go back
i believe he have whatever vanilla boss is here hp
i kinda knew from the jump it was a dead seed. Spoiler Log time?

I need it to be the 12th
Yeah I gotta get to the airport at 9am
Finally, a Mario RPG without Jinx
1 level makes all the difference phanto274Smile
Theoretically you also get more partner and stat upgrades
I got a dokkan youtuber interested in pape randos today
The 1st time I beat bowser I just winged it
I didnt know how to set up danger mario
I fought Bowser without danger Mario (when I first played casually) and the fight took 30 minutes even with good items
People have become too reliant taking half damage lol
I've never been more proud of you
If I fought Bowser again with knowledge of actual strategies that people use, I probably would save a good amount of time
maybe you thought goombario was at the beach and you reallllly want to get him
I'd go to the beach for goombario
We did never specify which summer
Oh, you didn't check Merlow while you were over there? Huh
Could be risky, could be worth it
gl hf o/ Did'cha ever run into the jr music bug again?
perry the platypus, i have no time for these simple games, i haven't even finished my inator, what are you doing here?
let’s see what paper 📝 jinx has in store 🏬 for us
good news: my new shower chair works
i'm not horribly dead after taking one
I'm wondering how you could fix danger mario without beating it with the nerf bat.
I'm shy till i get comfy, then i don't stfu
yeah im usually shy that way too, or if im 1/2 into a drink OMEGALUL
Ya or maybe remove last stand specifically. Then you have that risk using power/mega rush
I can see our 32oz margs are gonna be fire
I'M WILLING TO DIE FOR IT
I’m a social butterfly 🦋 but I do hate bumping into ppl I know in public
So, that 1oz could potentially kick my ass
Cats we stayed up every night at SGDQ till like 6am, and we ordered Taco Bell like 5 times
I dont drink at all so I don't pay attention to alchohol
staying up shouldnt be terrible as long as i have caffeine NiceSoftlock
GDQ has a sponsorship with Red Bull
Yeah, Phantom and I are volunteers, so we have infinite red bull
I never 👎 red bulled or monstered
I can't believe cats is going to be wired on her first ever appearance at GDQ KEKW
idk anyone else whos volunteering besides my one friend, hes host for some runs some nights and i think he does a lot of other stuff too with tech PAUSERS
Gonna be all of us iceblue69LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Phantom and I are gonna play an LADX rando that's got stupid settings
i might volunteer next time. I just wanted my first one to be chill so Gladge
blame iceblue NOTED wait what  HUH
ice 🧊 blue heart 🩵 trying to rig the event on u all
Only pape rando runners get excited for dirt
Note to self, suggest randomized boss patterns.
I still say randomize windmill key
it could be like 4th ruins key
Ralph selling the good stuff today
Its been 0 days since phantom talked to a tree
i may have overgrinded a bit in FF7 lmao
but i do have aerith's level 4 limit break
Power bounce is probably in ruins lol
So.. you gonna deliver that mail???
But but, in rain sleet or shine
Thinking out it, maybe instead of bringing danger mario down, other badges could be brought up. Like I've always thought it would be cool for spin smash to knock over the Koopa bros tower.
But you see that the issue, the tried and true methods always prevails
i mean d down pound is not  bad on him

"It feels to easy" coming from someone like you feels like it wouldn't be terrible wrong for league tbf
even with 3 hearts its easy
Might be something about RPG randos? Generally harder than adventure / jump n run randos, maybe?
Ya its more about the journey than the fights
Or you have RPG randos that give you OP items early on and then they turn into "find the items" rando, ignoring battles
Maybe it's about the good items having requirements? Paper has BP and FP thresholds, Dark Souls has stat requirements for weapons ... whereas some RPG randos are just like "you found it, just equip it"
Oh the minesweeper tracker is back, yay
What do you mean I see nothing wrong, its completely normal
It's 40% per room to be flipped, and 1 in 3 seeds has one entire area chosen at random the gets completely flipped
2 bp power plus, thats gotta be illegal
The train, so it could start one direction and end in the other
ok this is 10x better then mirror mode
just find the 6 bp peekaboo Kappa
Static mirroring's gotta be even worse with seed bleed. You just memorized that this one map is always mirrored, and now maybe it's not anymore
Welp we're lost, better ask the locals for directions
Is there a visual que for desert maps mirroring, I wonder?
Okay, the sun rays don't help, they're always on the right
maybe entering a north/south entrance from the right or left edge of the LZ, to see which way Mario enters the next map from?
the 2 empty spots on your tracker are making me suffer
you should just steal his coin
I just subbed for 3 years it's the least you can do
oh did someone fucking turn off health LOL
Kooper is getting his exercise today
... huh? What BP setting is this
So is it full random bp?
Shuffled was going to be my guess, yeah
Was about to say, it cannot be fully random since that is supposed to cap at 6 BP
I think with beta badges and shuffled, exactly 1 badge can be 9 BP
(which is kind of silly and I'll probably change that)
Well... I think we would get in trouble for answering that
im going back to sleep in a sec
it was -22 when i went to sleep now its -9
am i crazy or is this map mirrored
noo im telling you the moles are on the right side
i cleaned my entire setup and rearranged it yesterday its so clean
the map is mirrored you're lying
are the bp random or fixed
im jus gonna listen now and sleep gö
that cold water at 3am hits differentt
I created something blursed and I could finally share it online
it was a belated xmas gift for friend
they finally got and opened the package
I sent it out after xmas
and they have a PO box
so while it did arrive yesterday, they went in today to get it
and then the were a big meanie and teased me not opening it right away and made lunch and did chores first ch0mskYtilt ch0mskYtilt
Are you 2 hours deep with no hammer? Lmao
Is it me or is twitch tv tv only good for 2 weeks?
you do have 2 hammers u can get
I FINISHED MY FIRST PRIME RANDO!!
I used spoiler log on phazon mines so it didnt drag on too much longer but it did get finished
are yellow squares on map tracker for out of logic checks like if you skip mystery note?
some rooms being reversed is unbelievably cursed
what if the whole time u had the last seed on you
and if seed is not any of that?
want me to check log if it not here?
she just yeeted all of them lmao
np, hope the stream has been good!
Wait is this the 50/50 mirror?
still hate it but less worse lmao
Don't forget a pit run in that too
I spotted that seems like a marvellous seed 🤣
25 hp in phase 1 LMFAO
don't give him the satisfaction of a power bounce death
popesPOGGERS_HF phanto274GG jcogGERS qwilliPauggie jcogGERSC majinPOGGERS
Or just overkill him to dust lmao
My reuniclus sticker just got here
It has been placed upon my headphones
i have removed your reset button, you can no longer reset
Too late, they reset already monadoHands
unplug it and plug it back in wait no
“don’t make fun of me I’ll [reset]”
I forgot about this fight ngl
wow it was that easy for dark matter to return
adeleine already showing off the new FF14 job Pictomancer
kirby no that's not what the movie Face/Off was about
doing mgs1 vr missions for achievements rn lmao
like the missions from 1 not the other game also called vr missions
in the collection there’s an achievement for doing them all. so I’m grinding out the survival mission rn
doing all 10 gun missions back to back
Kirby had some incredible frictional properties
also today i found out one of the new characters in FF14's next expansion is being voiced by a trans woman. so that's cool :3
also the vr missions would be better if mgs1 wasn’t bad
that character is a big beefy cat woman so it's the most accurate usage of the trans cat emote i have on discord i've probably ever had lmao
just realized that probably is delayed on mobile but still like. I typed that the instant I heard lmao
the map screen song for w2 is good. too bad we hear it for like 5 seconds
oh my god a curling rock that is so amazinf
have you seen this game before?
iirc electric and ice is a fridge
only a little bit, never played it
mgs1 skips are limited by the multidisc structure right?
The only time I’ve seen it was when m4 did a few runs of it
isn’t that the same with a lot of ps1 games
phantom so bad smh my head
why didn’t the Kirby games I played have creative power like this. that or I was just bad
I like how most of the bosses in this game exist for like 5 seconds
fire hit box looks like such ass
HOLD up think i need to go clean my ears
there's three instances of waddle ass eating in this game lol
why would you say that? now i cant unsee it!
Kirby can have his cake and eat it too
and it not letting me un time pallos out
excuse me strimmer you're not supposed to find any use in stone kine
damn is pallos not coming back
oh no we had a fight today
Trains work better in this than smrpg
that’s a helluva level to get through
i do not recommend fucking the dynamite, that is not a good bang
is this the only uncommon game that has ice beat fire?
so in pape and the remake ice is stronger interesting.
i think 7tv wasnt loaded in for me
Kirby is my fave emote twitchable
okay fire sword is so cool
it feels that cold right now
where was your jump? kirby's appetite wasn't whetted by waddle dee's ass so he ate your jump input too
does this 100% run also include minigames?
if it doesn't, that's a travesty
why fire when you can darth maul?
Hey you are not permitted to reset
What if I gifted 10 subs
what if I gifted 1 extra sub on top of that
SPARKY NO YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR
Just finished using the new mini croc pot I got for crimmis. Didn't have quite everything for a recepie so I kinda half assed something. Didn't turn out too bad lol
Well that's a little selfish LUL
for a minute I thought the star block broke
i forgot about the one shots
The cool song that reappeared in Planet Robobot and some other niche games
i thought of a dumb meme
Do you just need plain spark?
The missiles that blow up aren't bombs phanto274Smile
hilarious that the very next level has electric as the first enemy
most abilities in this game are super slow
I remember playing this level a ton as a kid
Kirby looks so happy. "I'm an instrument of death and destruction :) "
6-3 is the enemy gauntlet but the one thing I specifically remember is burning+ needle being used for a shard in the floor
Bn3 rando when my hands get tired NotLikeThis
i was hearing the bn3 battle theme all last night
Is there a level that uses the burning+ Cutter (fire sword) ability?
hell yes best song in the game
If course cutter and spark after needle
it was a FUNNY idea tho
if it's stupid and it works, it ain't stupid
this is the actual banger of the game
and with that, Kirby has killed all the oxygen in the universe
i forgot how weird that boss was
you should check my meme first :P
he is very serious. he has a job.
when I was at home, I discovered that I still have my Kirby 64 box and all the original documents in it
still don't know where the actual game is though =\
Do you run this on wii?
the raphnet GC -> N64 adapter lets you bind analogue stick to d-pad. Is that against the ruleset?
yeah that's the setup I've been planning on using when I run this
Phantom you know that people will make up arbitrary rules for no reason
Odd question. Does everyone have a favorite cheese?
GG! phanto274GG That's what I get for being called away Sadge
tie between muenster and pepper jack
my GG is late as well Amish
my grocery has this smoked gouda that is incredible
We have a cheese bar in a Kroger near me as well
now I'm craving cheese real bad lol
You should leave this talk in cheese in the YT vod so you get more ad timers phanto274Smile
I'm eating fresh cut Gouda rn
this isn't wheels of cheese, but there's apparently a chain of humongous gas stations in the South called Bucc-ee's where in each one there's like a huge bbq pit in the store, as well as it being just a giant convenience store
If you go to iowa their core gas station is called kum and go
and soon those Albertson's will just be Kroger
Their food is shit but it's where we stop when we go there for kof so LOL
That's pretty much all we have here other than Aldi
that's what it's like in my neighborhood. It's Fred Meyer or Safeway, each about a mile away. Walmart and Target are a good bit away, though there is a Trader Joe's about 10 minutes out too
I've heard trader Joe's is a good spot
I have no problem with Trader Joe's
I go to target for the pokemon card section. It's always stocked
Any good mom and pop grocery store can't survive now days
walmart is both awesome and terrible at the same time
Sadly the closest thing to my house is Walmart and it's only 5 minutes
because you really want to save 2 cents on everything
my walmart have cheese croissant i really like
i know what this customer was trying to say in this SMS but what they actually said is hilarious
Marketside does make a good Italian hero sub though
it's the Sorry that gets me
Alright chat, which Costco Pokémon you choosing: Glizzet, Grasslice or Slinken?
Never mind I can't tell what the others are NiceSoftlock
Glizzet is a hot dog, Grasslice is a pizza and Slinken is a chicken bake
i got the gnc controller I mentioned in discord
Ah right, they don't have the chicken bake in Canada
31 bucks, but I got to check it out in person first which is a major plus
i heard someone once said what it was and their twitch and youtube channels were instantly deleted no chance for appeal
remember the days of going to a friends house and using their shitty 3rd party controller LUL
Rarely anything needs double of itself
they were at kirby's house and stole his tomato's earlier
Whispy was just living a happy life
I'm guessing that single fire, because of the ability to cancel, is faster than double fire?
those spear dudes are the most annoying enemies to me
did you know there are thorns in the machine fight room you can damage yourself with?
would be funny if there was a check there no one knew about for 20 years LUL
I wonder how many hidden blocks there are total
thats def one way to do it
Something is usually hard to do, doing nothing is awesome
Reminds me of a post people were remixing where one of them was, if you design where you have to wait, you are banned from making games
The original was, "if you design a quest where you have to follow an NPC but they're slower than your running speed but FASTER than your walking speed, you are banned from making videogames for 1 year."
I think stone and ice is used a little too much
Eating lunch and it's fried rice made by a combination
I hate birds that shit in general
Why's the lava got rubber banding?
If the aqua star is good, the neo star is always bad
Does the game specifically tell you you need burning?
Because I didn't see any color in the ice
We should hire those kinds of devs again to make things super cryptic that people go on YT/Google to look up a guide
I go insane listening to this song now
Butter Building is a cool song wdym?
It's a cool enough song Melee stole it
Part of Melee's intro is ripped from Butter Building and one of Melee's menu themes is ripped from SM64 Bowser levels
Probably good to remember after first boulder, go up
holy smokes my shape guessing needs work i got all the colors wrong
I mean look at quiet forest/1-2
Fire makes this a lot easier
Do other runners also hate that poppy bro?
the definition of a game cockblocking.
Honestly that poppy bro might be the play, despite losing 4 or so seconds
This fucking music while kirby is holding a lightsaber
oh man this power up is baller
I always think the cutter matter kinda looks like a crocodile for some reason
i never fought this boss could never get 100%
02 is just some weird egg
need to get it down to 69 place
I can't wait for you to jack into the bed
You need to fill up your retrotink profiles somehow
can't wait to hear the original version of the theme i heard all last night
i had BN3 "slotted in" to BN5DS lol
To be fair, most people probably generate on the site
When? It's gone down briefly a couple times
my only experience with Archipelago is i go to the room and download my oot seed and it was already patched
FWIW I think they also updated the install process in their latest update like a week ago
Archipelago is shit since i have to play on shithawk
im gonna have to ask yuou later how to roll these seeds
wow what a wild place to get that chip
i made a yaml but didnt know what to do after that
@axl_sr I read that as a different y word for a sec
the 1st yaml for oot i had invisible chest setting on Ture by mistake SMILERS
if you do decide to make a tracker for this having spin lite up with a check mark would be nice, or just something to tell them apart lol
have you found a good balance for settings or still experimenting?
"I would like DesertMan D" -Phantom 2024
I still need to play X6 lmao
I still haven’t since the last BN I was in
are these chocolates up to code?
as we know kids are stupid
u really are pulling all the stunts. BN3 retuns!
God I loved those as a kid
I love how America’s response to its broken drug industry was “ah yes lets parasite off of Canada’s drug industry” lmao
didn’t Canada say they were gonna forbid companies from exporting drugs or something
I thought I read something like that
Funny story time: I was watching a bn2 stream and this guy was in koto area for A license, he ran into quickman 3. He made a savestate and was brute forcing quickman over and over.  If he didnt beat quickman it put to the start of scenario 2 when protoman deletes the BBS post cutscene. It was like watching a a bad car accident, you know its horrible but you just cant look away LUL Cheer100
only YOU can prevent lost save data
battle network devs must be devastated that this isn't how the internet evolved 20 years later.
Hey youtube, if you made it this far in BN3 Rando give the video a like and leave a comment. Not a comment person? Then just use your favorite emoji. charizardUp
stream decided to fucking die so hi I’m back lol
Speader p? I barely know her wtf
At least let's go to dinner first
mega man when they said docking this isn’t what they meant
its was good bn3, it raind 18 shurikens
can you reg any of them?
I think with navicust your max MB is like 55?
Woodstyle is a bit op wouldnt u say?
I really want to know the translator that looked at “HARDMAN” as a perfectly acceptable localization
i mean how else would to localized HADOMAN
@pkmn03 its funny when u use water stage the way gets drowned and loses hp is funny as all heck
I bought some dumbells today and as Im laying on the floor my dog was pawing at them evertime I brought them down LUL
like the entire point is he's very very durable
I don’t know anything about BN I’m just here
yes I get what they meant
oh. I was replying to the other thing
you'd be fine if it didn't take wood styles 69 years to charge
bn2 is broken, you can get 4 aqua charges before 2 heat charges
oh I also still have to finish the Castlevania  gba games at some point lmao
when I did bn2 casually on LC I ran wood shield cause shield levels the fastest and had prism on reg so 160 dmg to all tiles is busted too
on average I got 4 charge shots on a single prism LUL
now i'm sad, i'm out of curry
maddy hasn't finished theirs yet, but they also got the "TRIPPLE THAI HOT"
Make sure you fight Dex on the www island
@pkmn03 what are you doing with your life? go finish them wtf
he hadn't beaten... is that bubbleman's cube?
its fine, you found it in Yai's room
what do you think of pape rando rando having key chains? Like if you find kooper and fortress key chain you can clear ch1
yeah, someone suggested it the other day
I just want it for ch 3, screw full clearing and having to come back
how did jenniferr get a hold of giga freeze exactly?
Gl on the like 10-20 mins left KEKW
alpha comp movement could make this last 45 minutes KEKW
Just make it go into the square hole
With all the PAs you have
You literally don't need any of this LUL
ice i love that both of us saw the best placement of programs for that lmao
What happened to the timer? Sorry if that was already answered earlier
ive had that happen a few times,when you hover over it the cursor has weird arrows on it?
yup, that would happen to me with pape. Id open the split files in notepad and manually log it going by vod timings.
over my 750 hours of pape Ive had it happen like 4 times
popesPOGGERS_HF qwilliPauggie jcogGERS majinPOGGERS phanto274GG jcogGERSC popesPOGGERS_SG
quick and easy, unlike making a seed
look i'm sorry i don't start for 4 minutes :P
just got in from a 2 hour drive through the snow
but I was on company time, so it's whatever
either people drive 30 over the speed limit or 50 under during bad weather
I have found yet another hyper annoying athena combo extension that hardly adds any damage but it's there
Demo player is a moron I hope they got fired
Hey you're not allowed to reset again
I'm so excited, I loved this game so much
Gen 3 is my second favorite
@ravenfp land it in bracket for WIK
semi lurkin with this as bg noise whilst I get my ass beat over and over in splatoon lol
@buff00n She's a fuckin point character I aint gonna have the bar for it to matter
in all the time i played as a kid I never saw him suck i don't think lol
I dont consider this a boss What do u feel about it?
more like a blue pecked seal.
I thought he was a penguin?
that logic clearly checks out /s
Seals and Walrus represent royalty. So the beak comes from Hawks.
Eagles are freedomistic while falcons are titans
hot pix in ur local area
you don't get to say that lmfao
The time to focus is now
i learned everything up to aqua star last night EZ
idk if i want to setup my wii for it so im just gonna do it on n64 for now and tank the loads
if i like it ill probably swap
I wanna play 64 again so I might yoink the route just to easily get everything with as little backtracking as possible
ill probably just go slow i didnt really mess with it
i wonder if there's a way to abuse jacob fuzzy mashing stand a on every safejump
i guess all of your characters easily could ye
it was 30 ms not 20 ms
i have a funny hat now
internet telling you "never praise me again"
when will you learn manip and skip to 1:05
remember when this woulda killed you
but now we get to see ash's fingernails
jacob definitely does that more than anyone else in this state
i should show jacob 646C dp punishes meterless when he jumps over your dp like that
he wears it down but when he's fighting the electriciy makes it stand up
okay he was begging to get dropkicked there
Can chip kill in this game?
time to swap my gamecube controller shells
OMG the timing my feed crashes and so did things
i thing you saw me talking to morph about it
I soaked my OEM shell and thats all dry now
okay i recorded the athena dp punish but i will not send it until relevant
is there sowfware I need to download?
interesting, OEM gamecube controller has an extra bracket for the triggers the the smash branded ones lack
Oh dear. My area has wind storms up through tomorrow up to 60mph gusts. Really picking up now. Hope power holds
its just to help keep the spring in place
"Thought about killin myself" -Steve Harvey
The Storm will be kicking Butt
im useing OEM triggers and plastic buttons, just swapping the boards.
I use the trigger plugs just for pape rando only
so this white controller was sealed in box, I used it for the first time in Dec and after opening it the edges are so nast y
what do you mean you don't want meat that tastes like a white suburban mom cooked it via boiling to death with no seasoning
now when someone comes over I can give them a shiney new white controller with a shitty stick LUL
gotta remember its not gg time yet
how are you liking LA rando?
the return of my fave woot woot!
cool, Ive really been enjoying prime rando myself
a few lights have flickered a bit. This is fine.
buttons are the fun part lol
the legend of super mario jasmenPog
and done!! Indigo controller with white cable and white controller port lol
this is just amazing Luigi playing in my fave
and button test passed, Prime is a good button test cause it uses everything LUL
I return with food. Link is uh, lookin a lil different lol
Hmm i might have to try this rando
Was there any unnecessary resetting? Kappa
the worst part about how bad mexico connections can be is how fucking good the players are
my winner's connection was awful, my loser's connection was good but i was tilted
i genuinely immediately messaged yurikov "honest salty question, how do i fight rock in rollback?"
didn't drop below 100 the whole set
i think thrashboy has PC issues
he's restarted and immediately fixed the issue before
wero is a lot more chill about online tournaments you can win that
el rosa you can win too but that's up to god
oh no i mean the grappler gods
el rosa will decide to be correct or he won't
you're gonna wakeup shatterstrike and he's gonna forward roll through it on a read
el rosa probably loses to anyone on rng online
i don't think he's really trying to win like that when i watch him in netplay tournaments
dont you get blue max off any level 3 dropkick?
oh just waiting for the stun
its insane to me how much you would love blazblue combos
i was checking on the website for this and i can do just dungoens er that's cool
idk cf rollback kinda sucks regardless
valk is just actually goat fg design in general
i was thinking about that earlier
genuinely fantastic FG designs outside of KOF
his entire character is being a scumbag too
"here's to a fair fight" is such a good intro line
yeah and then he immediately hides his psycho power behind his back LMAO
that's why he's always holding a hand behind his back he's literally a liar
i need to actually confirm my kim ch j.CDs from everywhere on the screen
i can clearly see where i win every set
i want to see every el rosa set
damn that was the forward roll
but that was the forward roll!
oh you probably play the rock i fought in winners
i think you win against both of your next opponents
hey i said i thought you beat rosa today
like im not gonna lie im here to watch you suffer
every time jacob doesn't kill we now have a game to link him
you hit the microdash combo every time you went for it
you went for the easy combo twice and dropped it once
i should play hinako just to spite your najd execution is what you're saying
we will neve get that sword
im not playing mary i have self respect
i will continue to play my men with excessive cleavage
ryo's gi covers up too much tiddy
even kim is hard to play
oh no i meant he doesn't have the correct amount of cleavage
anyway that was rock/isla/sylvie i lost to
yeah my checks were just getting blown up in games 1 and 3
yebutt my checks were just buttting blown up in games 1 and 3
game 2 i had the spacing right
i shoulda flexed just running at him with j.A more
ms was at a nice 124 i saw in the lobby
yeah this is what i figured
yeah thats exactly what i expected lmao
i need to sometimes just see 130 ms and say "i cant play reactive here"
like im actually kinda tilted how easy that was for you
i dont think reading that dude hopping was exactly hard lmao
looking over AP for emerrald and loving what im seeing
my ideas to stuff it just didn't work and i tilted hella hard
just what I can see on the main page
oh, it should be in the pop tracker discord then
oh im in an unofficial pop tracker channel and they dont have it
this is it, says its for pop tracker
im p sure that super is 200 min
when you've been fighting iori since you were in the womb i can imagine reverse anti-air inputs are in his dna
yeah shun gets run over hard
so being the goat is necesarry
brruh, there are so many settings to go thru lol
and I can just keep using that over and over?
so its like a settings string
I finally got around to watching my redemption yesterday what a nightmare that turned out to be lol
I got 9th in tns I actually beat a couple high/top level mexico
you need to only use this sprite
Legend of Mario: The seven Instruments
Back when I was a kid, I used to think it was the BIGGEST flex to have max rupees on the GBC Zelda games
don't you have to attack his ass?
Could it be the Mario sprite? Idk if that would matter or not
bosses are a bunch of haters tonight
ok were getting in the clear
I wonder what the spoiler log will say and if Bosses difficulty was heightened.
Just tell me how much you'd like to fu.. Wait fuck it's not a person or a degen
Is this the one with the Mai Mai or am I think albw?
I had so much trouble with the floor bot things first time
Ever thought of doing seasons/ ages randomizer??
I know seasons like pape runners know pape 64 LOL
hopefully sooner than later but i havent done any learning today
im basically just following your pbs since the guide's videos dont work
its at least a pretty straightforward speedrun for the most part
i might end up setting up my wii but i really dont want to lol
it just looks nicer on wii too
I mostly lurk, but I've really been enjoying the Kirby runs
i cancelled my pro nintendo membership or whatever but i was also thinking of just renewing that so i can play switch
the problem with setting up my wii is i think i have to re homebrew it from scratch and ResidentSleeper
i get two pretty consistent getting the first hit with the backburner
apparently theres a newish beta feature for auto captions and its really funny
i think its an obs thing tho
its not on this stream but ive been watching it elsewhere today lol
Oh crap, my sub ran out. Gimme a se
Hey. Friendly reminder. No resets :)
I come for the sub 1:30
Why did the shark swallow Gordos?
And why didn't it die from them? WutFace
also why is it oil spill? p4ntzThink
Clearly they're related to the Paper Mario Spear Guys. Tryna get their revenge on you
i kind of want to replay this game
switch version has input lag still right?
oh I thought it was an emulator issue
And as a Kirby game rule, you'll lose it to a regular hit for no reason
I just recently got expansion pass that’s why I asked LUL
wait they still haven’t patched the audio stuff?
I just assumed that was fixed by now lmao
Boi that was a Waddle Doo
This game has very strange invincibility frames
I've noticed a few times you'll be mid-fireball and still take a hit
Unless it's literally frame perfect damage
I think it’s funny that n64 is probably what most people bought it for, and n64 is the least polished emulator lmao
beats pokepark runs at least right? lol
this run have a lot of bs in it
I’m sure Nintendo totally has a plan of how to preserve these emulators once the switch lifecycle ends (they don’t)
There should be an option to take off Kirby's shoes Kappa
But can anyone ACTUALLY confirm if they are shoes?
kirby, get out of the fuckin 😳
ah, one of those then, gotcha
it's an hour and a half of a run
as opposed to 20 minutes of First Cycle or Prologue
also it’s not like something like Complete Saga where it’s like. a 3 hour run or something
yeah Lego SW TCS is like an approximately 3 hour run
mostly because there’s a bit over an hour of unskippable cutscenes
yeah summoning salt does good stuff
I know I make that joke every time but. c’mon.
Hiya Phantom phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Smile good luck
also it’s funny that the NSO versions of Mario Tennis and Golf don’t have any of the gameboy content
fun fact. there actually wasn’t enough space on the cartridge for all the e-reader levels in Mario Advance
I finished something based today monadoWreath
how how this and the minecart level are basically the same
is that an advanced long pillow with a cup holder?
Let Kirby life his best life as a pole dancer smh
lol i was just thinking that
you had destroyed one of the green things by jumping on it, I think. Either that or powerup
They have to get the most of this song since it never ever comes up again in the game (at least to memory)
do you want to try some fast strats I made for the vine room? I'm wondering if any are easy enough for a beginner
sorry I guess I should have explicitly asked if I could post the link specifically
there's 2 strats so hopefully one works
just watching this part make me want to play dkc
yeah this part of the game likes to screw you over
Like for hitting it or avoiding damage? What are you struggling with
Tap down/left (or down/right or whatever) repeatedly so you're not holding the directions
that will allow you to dodge while not moving out of attack range
doesn't quite work in text form though
IT'S NOT MY FAULT. I HAVE DYSFUCKSIA
My fave thing about kirby is just all the nihilism and cockiness of the enemies tbh. How they laugh about setting off a boulder that doesn't crush you or divebombing to try and kill u but hurting themselves instead
All with a big ol :D face
Looks like you just need to mash faster for a 2-cycle
don't think there's anything else you can do
I did that in a relay
I literally just raid komari and he raided into you LUL
phanto274Rage that song was a banger how could you
can you lend me your emmy cart COPIUM
i play teested to first gym last night
no way  rubix cube was just solved in less than a minute
did you use extra sources for your vertical tracker? cause the emo tracker broadcast view is horizontal
sure, ill hit you up later
pokecenter speedup is so nice too
Raichu  will get a new move at level 6
i was looking at the tm KEKW
the test seed I tried first gym gave surf, it was funny seeing the map tracker open up LUL
Every time I think about Emerald randomizer I think of the time Brandon started with Registeel and only used Explosion
But it's before you can catch more pokemon
a bat having fire is funny as heck
can berries berry loacations be added to the pool?
Nice. I didn't miss too much
full heal let’s go best check
double wild encounters would be sick, like it has a 10% chance or something
Rayquaza been eating candy, its mouth is blue KEKW
funny thing for me was just the other day I was talking with Ouro about modern pokemon has all these double format moveset but no double battle in the main adventure. This rando fixes all of that
shoutouts the kids playing video games in class
ive never seen that ivysaur sprite
roxxane after beating her own gym be like
isnt it based on your trainer ID?
I think it’s just box skins in the regular game
good to know we dont have to do that
you will know for next time i guess
I love how role play lets you get air lock onto random pokemon, it’s fun
you have to beat the gym for this check
because then he gives you the letter for Steven back at the ha
If I found a rare berry in rando I can trade that to my vanilla cart right?
I think the e reader data has to be on there though?
depending on what berry it is
couldnt you do rock smash in the cave or do HMs still require badges?
I know you can only have so many rare berry types on a cart at once
because it’s all the same dummy item, ereader uses it as a vehicle to make the berries
I love the e-reader it was so weird but. oddly charming
I always imagine chuggaa saying it
how do your key item randos usually go?
I’ve played emerald a few too many times phanto274Smile
im so glad pokenav is vanilla
so you can set wonder guard to be disabled entirely
i bet this wont be a babypokemon seed
might be the version of randomizer you're using then, it's separate from the key item randomizer ... part
sableye wonderguard please be possible that would be funny…
Yeah AP doesn't have all the options of the native randos for a lot of the games
oh i guess i'm an old hat then lol i used to have to use a batch file and change everything manually
Oh didn't realize they added it that recently. Been looking for games besides OOT to learn for multiworlds
i stopped doing key item rando because of how tedious the setup was :) sounds great that they're automating it
i did a pokemon emerald and crystal full key item rando and random warps (that can take you between games) It was rough lol
it's another project similar to archipelago  the crystal game is technically a emerald base remake of crystal on gen3
if you don't like fan game remakes then you'll probably want to pass :p but it was fun for about 5 hours until i got completely lost with where to go next
i'm trying to find what level of randomize this is... are hidden items possible to be key items?
you get used to it after a while lol... but now i feel nerdy
You'd basically just have to have the maps up which sounds tedious
you'll have to buy the strategy guide lol
i have them too - i don't remember if they do or not .. i'll completely take your word fori t
the old strategy guides were relatively barebones for Pokemon iirc
i watch a lot of full key item races and that's how i learned basically
I have it right in front of me, looks like they listen the hidden items but not wherre to find them
they got better after like B/W I think
i dislike b/w because the battles take too long :)
it’s like “hey it’s somewhere on the screen” and it’s like WideKirby thanks
don’t forget to charge it between uses though! phanto274Smile
wait, is that how the HMs are listed?
metal gear collection got an update on consoles the other day btw
you can multiworld with starcraft 2? wtf lol
you have to deliver the parcel
which I don’t think you have
imagine if Brawly has the package
I looked away, did you remember to turn off animations
the non-archipelago key item randomizer discord is still up with functioning links if you wanted to do that instead :)
i think the main appeal of this variant is you have control over the randomized options you choose
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i hope they add all of these options to archipelago and keep making it better
i'm trying to make one now, i'd have to agree
I agree about the UI. But love the ability to do cross game multiworlds so I just deal with it
yeah they literally have to make a guide for every game
rock smash wher eyou saved peeko
Yeah just a stand alone yaml generator that doesn't suck would go a long way
might be a case of "I know backend dev but I don't know frontend dev"
I was surprised I had to download a client just to make a seed
is the tracker automated at least :)
that's how you meet someone in pokemon, you battle their pokemon to death
I think ill just gen a bunch of seeds at once so I dont have to worry about it
ah busted Gen 3 surf I miss you
I mean it IS Hoenn after all 7.8/10
rated for having just enough water lol
dont talk to mr stone dont get pokenav LUL
does he give you another check tho?
they just wanted to give you their money
How stressing has this shit been? Been in and out finishing dq 11 shit phanto274Sip
She doesn't love you Sadge just like my love life
I love rando in this game because you met the most wack shit known to man
Wonder guard is a thing in this seed Pichu, we saw a Donphan with it earlier
just wanna make sure im understanding this right, every seed I want to roll I need to gen a new room on the site?
Nah fuck that I'm doing oot rando
ill ask for details later lol
It's fine as a multi world stand alone client, but standalone nope
Did you see the trailer for MvDK remake that tells you they're actually adding some shit to said remake?
I was never really sure if that was a remake or a new game
its a fun one and done
I liked it back in the day but don't think I wanna pay $50 or whatever they want to play it again
apparently, Time Attack is a mode they're adding
guess golbat doesn't like you enough
they added a casual mode to M VS DK in case you thought it was too hard on GBA LMFAO
How do you make that game more casual
Luigi just backseats and tells you what to do
she's got that 20 / 20, gaddamn
why are there so many random assholes on that one route
they upped the trainers because they were really proud of their battle theme
supposed to get cold this weekend
I'm going too. Supposed to be between like 20 and 50 all week lol
getting down to -10 for a couple days here
that's a TM that exists ;D
we should be allowed to spray trainers in the face w/ repels if we don't wanna fight
You staying at the venue? I've got a buddy that lives in the area so I'm gonna be coming and going
that way i could get sick with everyone else
Yeah I can only swing it because I don't have to pay for the hotel, thisll be my first one
That's the way to do it. I'd basically just have to room with strangers though, no one I know very well ever goes
you're welcome for the gifted sub to komari_ btw Kappa
I'm already waiting for the thread for gdq for who caught covid there
I mean if you use something called common sense it's hard to get sick
East side north west, checks out
this is when I call quits, good luck
when i lived in SC there were quite a few streets with NE western ave or SW eastern st
Yeah just head east on northwest south avenue
they're all relative to the mega church in the middle of town i guess lol
this swimmer's the wrong trainer class
now that surely is a sight. a small child flying in the wind on a large snorlaz
I for some reason have memories of snorlax having fly in stadium and it being a ridiculous animation but it might just be a fever dream I had at some point
It wished it wasn't level 14
rigby, slopdop and i commited war crimes
we won like 95% of our unite games
there's a fresh new emote in the smrpg discorf
I was able to figure it out with the web site. I genned 15 seeds so I know how to do it now lol
So if I wanted ro roll bn3 I'd have to remove the yaml from that folder?
I like the GTA V Trevor haircut.
You know I love you. Haha.
I uh... I've been doing a whole lot of the smokey smokey.
Lots of CBD stuff to calm my anxiety and all that.
Played anymore funky game mods since last time?
Oh nice. What was this one, this time? I remember the find the endings one we did.
ohh that 1 i miss some of it
Oh, neat. I'll keep an eye out for it.
If you don't know the badge names just look at the trainer card lol
Some manner of FF Tactics or Tactics Ogre game in July because my Birthday? : D
Oh, but that's not my birthday. kekw
Standing in the rain no less
i don't think you beating this before i go to Bedge
what the last stream before gdq?
Oh yeah. I'm probably going to try to tune into GDQ Live.
And just keep it running the whole time.
I'm excited to see the shiba speedrun for obvious reasons
There's like... 40+ runs that I want to see this year.
The only runs I'm gonna be doing is to the marg restaurant
If it's 5-10 minutes from the hotel, no
But is that taco bell 24 hours?
To be fair, I used to watch the entire show from start to finish on like, two hours of sleep.
I'm not even kidding. It was bad.
fuck morp coop run is at 1034pm Sadge
There's a taco bell that's open till 4am
I found my bike 10 minutes in lol
Close to the hotel, like maybe a mile
I mean, I also have uber eats plus
Make someone drive through the snow
its over around 330 am hm guess i am staying up for that
Yeah i'm canceling my uber eats after GDQ lol
oh so you cant progress if you dont find CUT or SURF or stuff liek that?
sounds cool, have you bumped into any legendary pokemon randomly
Well, I'm going to take off again. I'll try to say hai again soon. Have fun at GDQ and don't do anything I wouldn't do. So, don't do anything. At all. But really, be safe! Catching anything, airborne or otherwise. kekw
Phantom is gonna do everything now
would love to see your good rod
" Roleplay is REALLY good " Phantom
i was just playing totk today, love that game
personally i think the newer zeldas are better than the old ones, is that a bad take
i been thinking about trying link awakening rando but i probably have to use the map tracker
@Extracupanails new Zeldas (specifically BotW and TotK) aren't BAD, but they're definitely not what I want from zelda
are they talking about breath of the shit and tears of the boredom
Report this grunt, this bastard's using WATER
Gonna petition someone if Maxie's running Water-types
nice my internet took a shit
both of whcih are, sadly, better than was I currently have
Every game they throw in a little fuck you but they mix it up every time
itemfinder is the equivalent of finding peekaboo badge
ill let you figure out the settings before i give it a shot
ask the old man if the island is here today FeelsOkayMan
my good nonbinary bitch, what are you still doing up
have u tried asking Kyogre about water falling? I've heard it's very good at doing that
that's ur problem! u asked Kyogre to make the sky fall, not RAIN. Silly!
hey now, they could be *rivals* for all u kno
ur still at it do u have ur digits left?
:v you technically need it for Gen 2 and 4 idk what you're talking about
Kyogre, representing Gen 3: Fuck you landwalker you thought I made the SKY FALL instead of EXPANDING THIS DO-cean.
YOU DO NOT GET TO GO FREE DO NOT PASS GO GOOD DAY
I forget, what's the purpose of turning the generator off for again
You *did* see two freaky looking electrodes, that's worth the trip
I can spare you the misery of low tide lock
This guy looks like he's having an existential crisis in the worst place on this Pokearth
You are not low tide locked
and now I will get my giggles on in the bg
Fat i laughing his butt off in the house
I can also say that 123 girl is dead
im laughing my butt off. darn typing
Castform hands u some goggle like glasses. 'damn bitch you live like this'
No. You punish him for going out for milk and never coming home cause he's Slaking
How many of the other gym leaders have you done?
oh, does it treat like, you beat a gym leader as overall collective progress vs individual progress or st?
It's me I'm toxic and I rain down filth on unsus- wait I had a bit earlier where birds were innocent of this
I've met some fine lookin black belts who look nothing like black belts
I kinda wish I had stayed up with it but... it was so expensive : (
Potted plants block something unless you have something known as an e reader
"The e-Reader functionality was inaccessible in Pokemon Emerald versions outside of Japan but is still within the code and can be enabled to accept eCards."
are the shiny things not items
so yeap, you were Norman Reedus and his Rattata Fetus locked
Storage Key I think is needed to get over there
but I'm unfamiliar and google is falliable
good thing you got all the extra xp exploring the ocean
Someone didn't grow up navigating Sky Pillar 😏
This is exactly how Kieran ends up fucked up and evil
Maps don't help navigating the Mach Bike
i always liked how they just have 2 regular dudes blocking the league
they go to 55 if I remember, I think that's about average for E4 levels
Ampharos with an Assault Vest is very funnee
Oh I forgot you can straight up use your bike here 😭
a *little* weight for big fights to have higher BST
it's the voice of Gen 3 here to personally ensure you cannot move forward
I, too, would pull out a Salamence before Corphish
I've seen Persian take down Garchomp before in gen 4, shit can be scary
but that's with Stab last resort
eh, better to be overprepared. It's the only reason I got away with first try Volo
oh right hips out is the champ here
can confirm btw, storage key was necessary
Poliwag is proud of surviving only to perish
that is objectively the correct play
damn, I see how it is

ok, obs is being bad for me but it looks like they're going through at least
I slightly inched forward and COMPLETELY fucked up my ankle
I made money TO'ing cuz FUCK playing in bracket
cool $80 for standing around yelling at people
Chicago majors are built different, I guess
Hell, ComboBreaker's paying $40 per bracket, so I'll absolutely be fiending to run some CB brackets
I volunteered under the assumption I was "volunteering", not getting paid
the pool that took the longest was KOF, which made sense
Smash was fine until it became Bo5 for some silly reason
smash shouldn't be bo5 until top 32 minimum tbh
Bo5 should be for GFs, imo
alright idk about just grands KEKW
@morpheus080 I'll shake on Top 8, final offer
them starting bo5 as early as r1 pools is crazy to me
damn malon can just clip like that
she should be getting these checks
Bo5 to get outta pools is crazy
Minish Cap but it's multiplayer a la Sonic 2 co-op
I've learned I become unashamedly biased when I'm hungry as running bracket
if you're down the set, I'm rooting against you so I can go get food sooner
this is so funny. ha ha ha ha ha hu ha hu hu
@buff00n this is just normal behavior tbh
we always rooted for the person in winners at my locals so we could go eat sooner lmao
wait does that actually bother people lmfao
Rolling in Minish Cap is why MC is the best top-down Zelda
have they ever played a 3d zelda
Yo gl with bad game I mean good game
Stare not sure if i should BOP swift or not oh Yo swift
Do it tiger and you will regret it
Dud exo give you the plague
I think buff00n is falling asleep can you scream real quick
if you start losing I'll unplug the wifi
one ☝️ hr and still not beaten someone is majorly rusty. hope trip went well.
where dose this game fall in the zelda timeline
the beginning like skyward sword 🗡️
have you ever done a pokemon randomizer
the dragon 🐉 somehow becomes fairies 🧚‍♀️ in oot
that PR i sent you, did that cover the apartment in rustboro that was missing from the tracker?
maybe I didnt actually send it then?
the hot springs was added, and the other 2 i found was kid on second floor of apartments, and rusturf tunnel item east. Ill look into it later.
oh yeah you in vegas now huh
yeh I saw it. I'm thinking about submitting too
I can get up there pretty cheap
remember the game before and how awful it was
i remember the audio to this day
raven didnt remember so i showed them the mwsf run
"I never knew what it was called we just made sounds to reference it LMFAOOO" -Raven 1-27-2024

vibin and having leftover chineese from lunch
good 😊 to see my fave boss
oooh, is that a snorlax plush I see? cute
yo gl, nice rupee and arrows
KEKWait ok game the 1 rrupee 5 arrows was funny the first time
a year should have 13 months. Just think about it, if we had 13 months instead of 12, every month would be exactly 28 days. The first would always be a monday and the 28th would always be a sunday. Every month would have exactly 4 weeks instead of 4.25749638712500093 and we would properly align ourselves with the cycle of the moon. Cheer100
Why does Vati have an eye in his crotch
No way we getting bonus content!
sounds like a grand ol time
Ok its go time and ur wearing my fave tunic
It's been a bit. How are you doing?
Oh sure. Hope you feel better! The weather has been so weird where I'm from. I hate climate change due to global warming
I feel that. I'm in Wisconsin. The ice and fog is messing with me
Yeah I totally understand. I feel like the weather is very brutal with the transition and then if it's supposed to stay cold it should. It was in the negatives here last week but now it's like 40. I don't like it
Not good for the immune system. But at least Link can handle the desert
Apparently my previous message didn’t go through
I know it has to do with internet
The last time it happened wasn’t even a twitch problem unfortunately
It was so bad before I had to use cellular data
The remote bombs were kinda hype imo
inever seen that room filled like that
I beat this and this is blowing my mind lol
thought i was watching speedrun lol
Fire is one of the worst things in this game
I might need to replay this
@ghirahim_xc yeah this is fun to run
It looks fun but I’ve also  seen not fun moments as a speedrun lol
link between worlds is probably mine tbh
This ones so cool i like it
I also need to get on Golden Sun at some point
i am slightly less depressed, my mom got me a lego set for my birthday :3
yeah thats the plan, thats what ive been working on the last few days
but i hope youre well phanto274Bless

so you saying bowser might sucks ass to fight
how many badges are we working with?
this luck is a fluke KEKW
oh looks like you be fine
My house is almost back in 1 piece now! Just need electrician to hook in new ac and fixtures 😆
what are you thinking like 8??
what is the goal with this trick
ok is one check i understand but wow
nice when they found new tricks
Since when has this baby had different colors?
You'd expect me to realize huh, well that's one for me for forgetting shit probably
good lord how many Tayce T items can you get
Woke up to see you on my Switch. Couldn't tell if this was Stream or a vod at first.
Rather than getting cooked items can you change it and get battle items eg shooting stars?
1FP spook what a scam Madge
How bad is this badge pool
How restricted is the pool today?
we love a good fan smack
don't worry, usually i say d-meh-yr
Just the distracted drunk stream i needed.
okay done with my casual FF1 rando
i did music rando and temple of fiends past music was the fucking VICTORY THEME
that didn't get old. nope. not at all.
FF1 Rando? Never seem that before, how long is the usual run
i mean depends on the flags really
this took about... 3-4 hours i'd say?
i also had a randomly generated OW so that was fun
why suspicious? there are quite a few checks left, aren't there?
welcome to endgame of rando hell
you got to be shitting me right now he was in the mail bag
i'll be going now, good luck and gnight!
okay just took my new cane for a test walk
i was able to get through two laps around my building instead of one

omg u went there ur gonna go for a second. peepoStay
is this an awful shop spawn?
oh my fucking god i just saw the funniest thing
a really shitty AI generated news article with the title "Understanding the Mysterious Aura of the Areola Borealis"
just a screencap of it of course
but it also has the great line "we will explore the true meaning behind the areola"
Hii Phantom phanto274BLANKIES I'm finally here! Just worked 11 hours str9ngSadge
Better now that i can watch rando phanto274Smile
they absolutely choked the 2nd half
Phantom can you say "fuck you buff00n" rq its on the hotel room tv rn
Welp, best of luck getting either of those from Cley
wouldn't have anything to do with hundreds of other people in a relatively small space for a week either...
Did u take part in the massive group photo of zelda runners?
if i get sick blame phantom NOTED
also did your capture rig change? Seems less...blurry?
well Spitle got sick from that.
did you always have that? Or get it recently?
why not Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks
granted, I bet most people at the show probably have clocked a time in "2D" Zelda games, so that would be a large photo
I know, I'm just being a nitpick
ok now this is just abusive
where is the speed in this run? 🙂
yay a decent badge and decent cost
plot twist, kooper is the 5th koopa bro, and has been trying to earn their respect his whole life

I wonder if the Kirby one is out there
In ascii tiger KEKW I know the emote exists
I'm pretty sure there's a rule 34 corollary that speaks to characters having images of them smoking weed on the Internet somewhere
Yep sounds about right for the sa2 community
that is indeed a snoop dog sized blunt
What's funny is it comes from sa2 KEKW that's the origin of it
why are they're so many cookies / cakes lying around this seed
He went to kick sonics ass because he didn't get his Zaza break
I left my weed at home, what do you want from me
peepoIgnore HappyHippo man look at this hippo
To be fair I'm also on mobile, I just have most emotes remembered in my keyboard to how they're written KEKW
i just walked in and they were there idk what to do
SadgeBusiness has anyone seen my calculator, i think i left it with my kids toys, maybe he put it in the toybox?
You say that as im eating spicy mcchicken
I had 2 for 3 50
I’m now getting tempted to order some @ravenfp
Phantom how hot do you take your showers we're having a discussion
Buff00n is being a pussy ab hot water
I do hot water, not "burn my skin to the bone, hot"
gotta wash the covid off somehow
I used to enjoy cold showers. now that I’m much older I do like warm then hot showers too
gotta wash the covid off somehow
The switch twitch app is so shit
I downloaded it long before they removed it
i didn't even realize that was ever a thing lmao

at school I hand-soldered a 96-pin microcontroller to a PCB and it worked
of course, that was after I destroyed two others...
yeah I can understand not wanting to do so after that
when PM was hot, I grabbed 2 or 3 white JP GC controllers for at least $20 each
Buff00n jusr played a Mario kart race with a guy named cuntfucker
still, there's the answer. That's a sweet price point to hit
see OEM Joy-Con prices. $70 for a pair is bananas
I'll be sure to yell at George or Kham
I do hear good things about the Hori pads
mmm, see I don't like clicky buttons
I've been stuck into 8bitdo controllers ever since I bought their Pro+ controller
would strongly recommend their Pro2 or Ultimate Controller
Ultimate has the Xbox layout, if that helps
Ive grown a deep attachment to my ps4 pad
These seeds today are really mental tests

Rogue probably doesn't approve - but i've been mixing the Rogue skittles but not skittles flavor w/ fireball, it's better than i expected :]
Yesterday was my bday!! Im 20 now!!
You buy any of their waifu cups yet ?
I have like 6 of the stainless steel 24 oz one from gfuel and ... yeah i hear you about having too many of these things

Imagine failing that watt action command lol
our tap water is disgusting well water and as such i order 5 gal jugs of some spring water. But on the bright side the dispenser makes it really cold
Yup that lag always gets ya

Gonna head to bed now, good night little2636Wave
Reset audio is broken again btw
and I'm usually the one who's borked because Twitch likes to be dumb
Surely you can roll the A/B right?
twitch is like "you should stream metroid prime remastered." Despite remasted having less average viewers than gamecube prime LUL
im pretty sure if you inhale a copy star and an enemy you only get the copy star. But I might be wrong about that.
But isn't fire dashing the most riveting content?
Mashing repeatedly is tough, part of the reason I haven't learned BHS is it hurts my hand after like 5 minutes of attempts
That didn't bug me quite as much but maybe cause I was a lot worse at getting it consistently so I had more breaks lol
I don't think I will even ever attempt TTYD cause of that
Turbo is just so nice for speedrunner longevity tbh
We'll get to see kirby eat waddle dee's ass again phanto274BLANKIES
No one tell Pallos that Kirby is here
Rock cutter sure is an ability
Had to switch to PC cause mobile is bugged
Is there anything in this game that does more than 1 segment of damage
I think anything with water is cringe
I seriously expected at least one death on that first level
More surprised that didn't stop them
You either have a whatever neo star or cringe neo star
It was good. How goes kirby 64 runs?
I kinda wanted to learn this run. I have the cart but never really tried to learn it
Doesn't the leaderboard have it separated or something though? I foret
Honestly I'd like to see an actual expansion to combo Kirby abilities in a future Kirby game like certain combos cane solve some/most problems and some where it's hyper specific, what star allies did was close but not fully explored
the ddd on fire animation is kinda cool
Why don't people run on switch? input lag or?
I never actually tried a 64 game on switch, never paid for the thing I think
I don't understand how nintendo thinks that's okay
And Nintendo will never fix it
hasn't the 64 stuff been available for years
Then again I know n64 games are really hard to emulate from what I hear
Sparky is going through it rn
are you playing this on og console?
your stream makes it look like a ps5 game
Didn't know it was that bad
idk how people have that kind of perseverance
I can't imagine grinding a run like that on wii u
I bring it up cuz of how much worse it is in comparison
Also I don't wanna get spoiled
Cuz i do plan to play smrpg one day
its go time lets rock these fools
i have been craving a double chocolate cake like its nobody buisness
i think its another term for pound cake
this looks like it would be fun on handheld
The derust is real just finish out strong no quit
Punch the bee in the dick Madge
At this rate I think the game has the mutual hate you have for it
the run ender is over gbye swordy
the hippomouse is such an odd enemy fusion. like what drugs were the og team on
PogBones popesPOGGERS ghunzoEPOGna minimi6Pog PogChamp majinPOGGERS tippiPog
btw I was meaning to ask since you moved in you took Cley's room right?
You can sleep at night knowing I was in that room hacking a 3DS
They are surprisingly easy to hack after all
@buff00n did you see the Sonic x Shadow stuff?
is that difficult to set up?
It is high time. And whenever u get to kirby its ok.
You killed a man and took his hammer you monster
Wow Mario is an amazing actor
Mario showed his best chops in this game
And he literally made the castle shake
"Kid, I lay pipes on regular basis. I know EVERYTHING about PIPES."
ok Bowmoder we need ya beat
no one you say? *levels to spite you*
this guys mouth movves like a muppet LUL
for emerald what do you think of starting with fly? The one I did last night I didnt get it until mt pyre
have you been sleeping as much as samus and link
i been going to sleep around 1am ish and waking up at noon
fave portion of the run time
remembered why I buy games from best buy, less than a week ago I got Persona 5T for 30 bucks and tonight it went for 20 so they refunded the difference
oh nice u did a run back
yeah I don't look forward to my next move whenever that is.
how much did the route change?
ooh I thought this was bowser strats but the fire bomb, nice
giving the enemies iframes instead of you is cursed
@stavros12c34anenoglou they're about to get axed
i beat crystal kaizo+ e4 r1. im on my 2nd attempt. kinda godlike.
He's not at kanto yet so
they made crystal kaizo+ which is more geared towawrds nuzlocking
no fucking level 130 pokemon lol
oh i had really good rng my stream so mightve taken yours
He survived like every rng point of e4
Platforming in this game looks so ass
I despise games with this camera angle that make you jump around
the nimbus land entrance sucks casually
gotta have several dozen lights in the same scene
are the crystals on the chandelier also dynamic lights?
No tekken 8??? Say hii to mvd for me lol
Sweet  glad u all doing alright
Pretty good just chilling playing some tekken

U getting princess peach right phantom
Noice I'll be heading there all of March ^_^
thanks for reminding me of state of play
I hope they announce Tembo the Badass Elephant remaster
I cant wait for the king calamari reveal trailer!!
so statte of play is gonna be sub 2:45
youtube has a chat? thats wild
twitch stream has a countdown its less than 2 minutes now
could make a short out of something
I remember they had to stop the sonic anniversary livestream cause the Twitch stream started ahead of the youtube stream
you are 30 seconds ahead of the twitch stream my friend is reacting to LUL
show us more Sega classic project like the jet set radio reveal
Mature content Sonic X Shadow kiss confirmed
I don't pay attention to the AAA(???) Playstation releases
Can I take a well deserved break with her but in real life?
this is such a slow reveal
I would do it all for Eve
i just hope sonic isnt a buggy mess
This game uses AI art btw
Worth noting Biolizard was a boss in Sonic Generations 3DS
I just saw the godzilla movie so im on board
new game from irrational devs PAUSERS
it looks like bioshock to a t
best part of the sonic reveal is kids are gonna go to google and type sonic x shadow KEKW
looks like it could be good, could be bad
Think of your wife as a beacon
we gonna get any more release dates?
i only am bothered by vr games because i dont have space for it Madge
500 bucks for a VR? hell no
ok phantom will be a vr sreamer
i cant experience the games so its not fair and they should not be made KEKW
black tiger, google sonic x shadow
yeah no i am good lmao
i played the 1st 1 and i sleep
I wanna see that ninja turtle game called ronin
i mean i might be interesting in this cuz of the time it take place in
kinda like the show Blue eyed Samurai
I love they stole asassin creed eagle dive
yeah let me just buy this game again for full price how about no
@blacktiger51 dlc the cringe of the universe
some dlc is fine like monster hunter iceborne
Im expecting kojima to wear a mask like that now. 2 hands cover the face LUL
Thank you kojima for black goop
that reminds of shigaki the number one villain of mha
If im honested Ive never wanted to play a kojima game except for boktai
They should do that boktai vs megaman battle network crossover again but with different franchises
Players will be able to connect Mega Man Battle Network to Death Stranding 2 for a one of a kind battle mode
i have no idea who that guy is
that is the most kojima thing that ever kojima'd
if i can't play as that guitar guy, what's the point
that looks 100x better then the 1st 1
need the universe where konami didn't fuck over kojima so we can keep getting mgs
just call it an interactive movie
So 20 hours of cutscenes and then you go around an empty wasteland on a bike again
damn he just killed it entirely with one sentence, that's crazy
so a Bedge type of game ok
I cannot be bothered to care about death stranding I'm sorry
Flashfrost is losing his mind right now
i cant wait for ff7 remake part 2
That was like 5 games with very long trailers that I didnt want to play
that "generations" in the yt search did so much lifting
ok i was thinking axl was trolling when he told me to look this up
If there's no GaySex in the remake what's the point
the website is shadow generrations lol
We live in an era where the Shadow the Hedgehog game is considered nostalgic and I think that's beautiful
i still remember playing that game randomly during the 2008 election
truly a time to be alive
i only remember it cuz of everyone staying up late that night KEKW
Shadow the Hedgehog has 326 possible routes each with unique names
And NONE Of them have a sonic x shadow love scene
maybe there's a secret 327 with it
@SeventyFourTG DO u think dark souls and skyrim stole off that?
hai bootiful glglgl with run(s) blobComfy
Most people don't know it because it's a show targeted towards babies but Sonic Prime definitely has generations of Sonic X Shadow
oh its actually a non-cursed thing
i wonder what a sonic and shadow fusion character would look like or their own kid.
Shadow better rmention that damn fourth chaos emerald
we got a proto and bass fsion with megaman alreasy come on sega give us what we want
and no one told me there was a silent hill 2 remake Trailer Madge
@blacktiger51 It featured entirely gun gameplay
Put the new one on twitter so we know how to reach you
Phantom do you still have the giant donkey kong plush
You should put him on the bed
with sonic also dropping on PS4 I wonder how long the PS4 will be supported. This holiday marks 4 years for PS5
would love it if they would just move on
imagine is switch is supported 4 years after the OG switch launches. That would be at least 11 years on the market
only thing i really mildly cared about was sonc
the only other thing i could've cared about is getting its own standalone thing next week lmao
mirby there is a write up on PS blog too
did you see what mike pollock said about it?
"You had me at Sonic X."
need to remember to get the FF7 double pack. You get remake and rebirth for 70 if you preorder digitally
can't believe we're getting Super Sonic 3D World + Shadow's Fury
yeah fair. i also really can't wait to hear the new remixes
i also disliked how they basically forced you to have to swap to hit certain foes
but the way they're focusing on party makeup and combo attacks and stuff makes me feel like that won't be as much of an issue in rebirth
plus really from leaving midgar up until temple of the ancients you don't really have any party members taken away. it happens a lot in midgar but after that
"go away barret go hang out with marlene or something until we need you maybe"
also hope th raiders are doing well
That is a fair assessment. And a true one at that
speaking of SPM, I got 4th in Defeat Shadoo last night :)
Honestly the Flopside Pit is really not worth it though. You have to complete all 100 trials TWICE in order to actually fight the boss and you know what you get for it? A few cards
Flipside Pit for Dashell is great. Flopside Pit is just annoying
i mean yeah, 0.9^4 is only 65%
oh boy, endgame rng! my favorite!
Oh no i meant the red essence not giving you a freebie
holy shit, I just watched the sonic x shadow generations trailer
knowing sonic team it's going to be mid but it LOOKS so GOOD
They got Ian Flynn on board for the new Shadow storyline so I'm mostly looking forward to that but they have messed up the Sonic game launches in some way consistently in recent years
I kind of lost faith after they made Superstars mid
Like at that point I was hoping maybe they could stick to their original formula and be fine. Origins was good enough
what's up gamers hope everyone is doing well (:
Maybe they can remaster their older 3D game style though. Here's hoping
I would love a Secret Rings remaster fwiw
Secret Rings with a better camera and no motion controls would be quite nice i think
They should do more remasters like what they did with Sonic Adventure 2 PS3/Xbox 360, just direct ports of Sonic Heroes and what not to modern platforms
I still don't know why they changed lives to a Tails rescue count
Sonic X Shadow Generations physical edition should come with a baby Shadow keychain
gl on the run Phantom pokemoGloom
yea i saw, i haven't checked the notes in a while though
yea i remember doing SR on mad adder once, it was so satisfying lol
I have a con to go to!
Gonna be Astarion from Baldur's Gate 3 tomorrow
I went to Buc-ee's for the first time
Yooo Phantom phanto274BLANKIES good luck phanto274Smile
But first day of con is tomorrow!
Gonna try and meet up with my friend tomorrow
She's going all four days too
All my costumes are hanging up
hey man, Do you know if 1.1 makes the game run faster?
Missing both Magfest and Agdq kicked me in the FOMO-ass haarrrd 💔
oh my all bosses is ass. I love running it, the only thing that objectively sucks is having to wait 10 minutes for the ending/credits to run through.
It’s been neat setting the standard.
I really think it can be done in sub 3:40 not exaggerating
ALSO… you’re not gonna like the 3rd chest
waiting for that damn plant to water
You can potentially waste 2 minutes for no reason not even kidding you
Same with formless but screen transitioning’s at least faster
Gassox in the remake actually. I was rejected for not fighting him and was confused lol
I thought there was a different formless or something LUL
I’m also considering if Lazy Shell is worth it or not during 3D Culex….
I kinda need peach to be the item gurl in that fight.
1) I need both bulk and status protection and 2) Item lock can be scary and you need to rez someone
I do use red essence on Mallow during it
yeah, it’s weird doing it at level 17
Mallow’s Snowy and Ultra Fireball is too useful during the fight lol
Star Rain’s not worth it. long afffff
Honestly it just feels good to set the standard for that category. I expect any vet of SMRPG to just bop me the second they have a mutual interest
so I’ve only done 2 runs of Normal RTA and apparently missed the part you buy whomp glove for Mallow.
I really need to get my sub 240 already in this game LUL
lot of RNG? takes me back to the Paper Mario days :’)
yeah. pray Geno just dodges her magic lmao
nahhh… kinda looked like mallow did more damage slightly from what I saw
it’s funny how ridiculous Super Suit mallow is 😂
It’s cool everyone’s still flexing their own route in this game
OH, This is breezy??? I was like Damn!!! LUL This nutcase doing a Super Suitless run 😂
I’ve never seen any breezy runs of the game.
Cool! 😄 I’ve been thinking of doing Breezy All bosses tbh too.
I still might get super suit for 3D Culex, it’s a lot of health. post bosses in general are the longest bosses in the game.
Quartz Charm Buff is also a godsend
I still need to go to RPGLimitBreak ;w;
I want to travel everywhere and like 10 cons but $$$$ 💔
3 = 4th. 4th = 2nd. It’s more confusing than it sounds
Shocker feels like a gamble if I perfect time it lol

At least it's evident in the recording you know how it's supposed to be done
ou'll get something good in that timeframe, trust me
Switch Pro D-pad is also just hot garbo
dang i missed it, nice run!
@kbzonfc1 def nice but unsubmitable due to massive errors
Yo I have a game to look forward to in autumn leggo
And ggs and hello and goodbye KEKW
@everyone strimmer asked you a question
My Laryngitis is going away and being able to talk rapidly
Still have a leftover cold but that's also going away hopefully by tomorrow
it bugs out a config file and resets it
gonna lurk. have a fun run
Never forget that LANS just used a old stock image of peach instead of recreating the picture
At least that's 4× the amount of vanilla
I thought it was baby sNeed logic
Do you know how the free fly location works? Like how do you know wherre its at?
gotcha, so it may have a chance of being somewherre you already been to
that check was bananas B A N A N A S. that check was bananas B A N A N A S. Cheer100
Or can you win a shield from crane game?
Heart containers and bunch o rupees
I think this is like the one problem with GBLA, is that you can't bind the sword and shield to it's own button
Y'know... Maybe that's the reason why it was cut in minish cap
goodness this seed is a jet and weird one
Unfortunately if you did use the ocarina it would take you out of the dungeon
Oh so the kill is priorized over the warp?
"Hope you feel miserable carrying around all those rupees!"
Honestly I miss that trend in Zelda games where there's a gremlin that thinks you'll hate having to do less or have more of an item
Lttp has the half magic meter goblin
Howdy gl on the shit show
Just out of curiosity, does the colo doc have the bayleef route notes?
1.7 to go for another ham submission
I almost read gooooin as gooning
I'm gonna make you get wr eventually
I have  170.5K that I really don't know what to spend on
It's always very monkaS when someone tells you I have (exceedingly high amount of channel points) and you have redemptions for the stream
I could spend it on 1 VIP to demote myself
It could probably count as a demotion
But it's up to phantom himself
(I know you're they/them but I just can't even know if themself is appropriate in there)
There was also a cracked wall
Oh right talon aka Mario uses the stick for the honeycomb
speaking of cracked that was a quick fight
so very cracked i'm guessing lol
As long as it's not Goombario
Leave Rover alone, they just want to play catch
At least you're doing good on HP
Oh sick, someone actually doing the Rando
Did you do the Monthly yet?
Still learning and already doing Hard Seeds? :P Nice though
You know about bomb triggers yet?
Bomb Triggers are huge. They Revolutionize D
But everything in their own time
Want an explanation of what it does and why or am I backseat-dumping?
Okay so you know the Legendary Bomb Arrows, right?
So basically if you place two bombs within a frame of each other, the game thinks you're trying to make a bomb error.
BUT because there is no arrow on screen, it skips to the next mechanic in the list. Which is Cutscene Triggers.
So if you place two bombs within a frame of each other you trigger a cutscene!
The problem is, you cant place two bombs at the same time, right? So what you're instead doing is being on the edge of a screen, placing a bomb, transitioning and buffering another bomb.
This allows the following: Yoshi Check without Yoshi, D7 Pillars Exploding, Tarin Cutscene without Powder, D8 Opening without Ocarina or Song, Windfish Egg Opening without Ocarina or Song.
Oh and Item Pickups at the one Pit-Heart Piece and in the Forest Connector Cave
If you wanna attempt it I can also guide you via text. But let me see if I can pull a video on it.
Can I post a video link or is that filtered?
This twitch user also has a video series showing every single hard, glitched and hell logic trick in the entire game.
minus 3 things that have been discovered since then. Like, for example, you can beat D6 without L-2- Bracelet now
Because you can actually bomb trigger the destruction of the Elephant Statues!
And I dont know if you're on the Discord yet but I can highly recommend it. Daid (creator of LADXR) makes monthly seeds that feature some sort of new additions. 2 months ago he added Enemizer for example!
Oh, you can also bomb trigger the Fisher witout the fishing hook which is fun
You can also get that item through the wall with bomb triggers
And Feed Papahl (but only if you have the vittles)
Bow isnt required, only locks a single check
But what if the Seashell Reward is Face Key! Kappa
Oh since you're an LAS player. Do you know the pecuilarities of the Seadshell Rewards?
If you enter the Mansion with EXACTLY either 5 or 10 Seashells, you get a Freebie Shell
This is not in logic but it gets you there faster
These 2 shells are also permanently missable, even in vanilla
I'mma be big chillin once I get to the crib
btw magpie also has auto tracking if youre interested
Still astounds me that Daid's Randomizer runs on OG hardware.
If you set it right on Magpie and check the "Unique-Items" menu it will show you how many Non-MCB Items are in the dungeon
So like if those 3 checks left are the M C and B it shows "0 Items left"
Any interest in Mina the Hollower?
Ah it's called "Show Major Dungeon Item count"
And then under dungeon items set to "Map/Compass/beak". And the chest next to each Dungeon shows how many checks are left in that dungeon that arent just MCB
I love magpie. Would marry it.
If you wanna try a bomb trigger here... Kappa
The game knows you want to bomb trigger
Broom Broom Broom Broom. I want you in my room.
Leave this room before you save and quit
Because if you save and quit in the same room, it doesnt actually save it breaking.
You could say this function in the game...
The odds in the vanilla game of the right side up are - I believe - 50/50
For LADXR, Daid upped the chances to 75% right side.
more like a 75% its gonna failed
I do feel like Small Keys are dungeon local
Oh I thought you said only MCB are local
Or did you mean MCB are non local
I got it other way around
Idk if it's also in LAS but did you know that Goombas always drop a heart if you jump on them
Do the bushes in LAS above the well also guarantee heart drops?
1 SMK + 1NMK for Facade
If you use them correctly of course
I dont know if that's in logic
Crazyyyy. It's considered in logic. The superjump i mean
Youre not clipped in most of the time
and with way I mean like couple pixels
Yeah I think the line up is with the 2nd row of water effects
How many items do you even need?
Like do you have the NMK?
You could also just... super jump to the pot chest.
This way you can't get the chest on the right though
if you use a key here while not having Max keys you might actually hard lock yourself fun fact
fun fact, you know the Raft Chest key?
So it can never be a small key if they are dungeon local
Oh here's a fast kill for Facade
You can place bombs before he shows up
so you can get 3 hits in before his first text bos appears if you place it near the lower side of him
nope just as soon as your previous bomb explodes, place next one
you can also count to 3 right when his face fully disappear and place the bomb
If you wanna try it: Line up with the Screen Transition to the actual egg by jumping agsainst the border with a Feather.
Then pull up the item menu. Have Bombs equipped. AS you exit the item menu, HOLD Bomb Button and Up
The feather doesnt let you transition
use the feather to align yourself with the edge
Aaaand that pretty much is it. You can kill all pillars with this bad boy.
Lineups also work with Pegasus Boots or by manually edging yourself to it
for left / right transitions you need to hold left / right and up
You can also buffer an Item Menu through the screen transition and then buffer bombs again through the item screen buffer for some of the harder ones (Pillar 1 & 2)
Pillar 4 is so easy to bomb trigger it falls over if you look at it the wrong way!
Deth I? I thought his name was DethL
Why is this Kansas but this is not Arkansas??
The worst someone saw was 12.
So we're tracking for Hall of Fame Purposes.
oh another fun fact, you remember the gohma mini boss?
yeah if you play song 1 or 3 or ocarina with no songs to them, they open their eyes.
You can also skip that fight entirely with Hookshot
If you do 0 Deaths there's a secret Prize in LADXR :pss:
Make sure to check out the Monthlies on the Discord
i do like watching this more then tmc rando
just wait till you get to Shaq Jumps
So essentially you Pegasus boot feather jump near a wall then pause menu before you hit the wall then you equip sword and item menu buffer the opposite direction and the sword at the same time.
And you do a jump in the other direction. That way you can stand on pegs and open chests like in D3 and D7
Dont get me started on JESUS JUMPS
I dont think youre ready to hear about Shonen Jump yet.
Jesus Jumps let you be like Jesus if Jesus was in the NBA.
That's why Shaq Jumps and jesus Jumps are best friends.
running against a good early game sucks
your PB is still the first one on the route change right?
its gone from my mind already
so I assume sub-2:40 is reasonable, then
I mean, that's what they say.
We're up all night to get lucky
ah right it came out literally as I graduated college...
I hadn't considered how much of an impact chain was gonna have on the speedrun vs the SNES version...
komari1Think so do all runs accomplish Mack Skip because he's not called Mack anymore?
welp time to leave then >:(
K see ya in two and a half hours
Omg two text boxes that changes everything PogChamp
You know now I get why some runners hate me KEKW
yeah, I'd guess Rose Town then also does some filter/effect which is unhappy when midas leaves things in a bad state
ohhhh right, which is when they queue the slowdown on the music
How many people hit this cutscene multiple times without restarting the game, after all?
doing pretty good, how are you?
come on dominos, get it together phanto274Facepalm
i am! im just lurkin car shopping online currently spinofdog
idk why my keyboard does this sometimes, the numbers just straight up randomly dont work and it only fixes when i restart my pc
i think it needs driver updates tbf but im just so lazy
im so frickin stressed tho because i need a new car for my current job and this new job. My vehicle battery just randomly dies and also needs three thousand dollars in repairs on the engine because it needs a new timing chain NiceSoftlock
it died mid shift on thursday and i was CRYING because i didnt know what to do and no one was answering me
thankfully my friend knew a guy in the town i was in lmfao Gladge
i negotiated a price on a car tonight that a family friend looked at/tested for me but the dealer basically wanted a deposit in order to take the ad down and keep it til next saturday
so i was like um. Im not putting a deposit down because i dont have that money rn and i also havent even seen the car myself
so i was like well, ill check in with you on wednesday
yeah well my current job is home care, so i literally am using my car to drive to clients homes
my new job is fourty-five minutes away but will also require occasional travel to towns around that area
im tryna also get a place in that town but theres like nothing to rent
okay this number thing is annoying me brb pc restart OMEGALUL
I found this amazing Miku figure
I can totally see someone crushing on Johnny from this game lol
"Don't be intimidated Mario, just try to imagine him in 3D. OH NO HE'S HOOOOT"
I'd definitely recommend this as someone's first RPG
But has basics like HP and magic
Isn't too long and the plot ain't complicated
The remake is obviously even better
So if someone wants to get into specifically JRPGs, this game would be my pick
I would say Pokémon too, but that's kinda different from other JRPGs mechanics wise
RPG has the more straightforward layout
Darn the shark bested us this time
Persona 5 Royal is too complicated to suggest for someones first RPG
I love it, but it definitely isn't for everyone
But Super Mario RPG is both simple to understand and really fun to master
persona 5 to me has to many group conversations for me to enjoy.
Once you rly understand the mechanics
I say as someone who's only beaten 2 superbosses
I know WHAT to do, I just gotta DO it
Peach is amazing, just not in a speedrun
Getting p much a full HP recovery with a proper action command
My main complaint with this game is the platforming
But the RPG parts are so good that they balance out
But yeah the platforming is p jank
I do like the way they use Stars in this game tho
The camera angle does not make it any better
@Ohrocks no Thanks for the gift sub!
What does bot mean by this
Shout-outs to Twitch doing stupid for the 1,000th time in a row
Like, when has Twitch done anything cool in the past 5 years without it going wrong?
I'll probably chip in 15$ when I have time and not working
Yo I just got 4 new static emotes back today 👀
I have like 10 animated slots too
idk wtf to do with them
these are the new ones that came back today
I'm pretty basic lmao you're guesses are probably correct lmao
Lost, NoU, Smiel, & Zombie lol
Okay, Rainbow Candy is a winner
Yeah I was gonna say nimbus castle
do you consider dodo to be mostly cutscene?
yea thi game needs this a lot lol
oh did you beat my fortune pb? lol
yea just gotta have in mind that you do half dmg when Johnny is red
lol true, boomer is a fight on a different game
YEP 12 am been going to bed early due too being fucking cold in my room
feel like i am in a freezer
we don't do heat in this house not cold enough for it
I see beating that Piranha went just as plant!
If you think that's good, I've got a pun more!
canonically the widest character in the game teejay46Cloudface
Why do those things look like mallow
Btw, I picked up that Slow Go badge at like 20 minutes
Took me 3 hours to beat that seed
I told chat, next I'll do an Iron Boots only Zootr, but it's more expensive
Didn't you do BN6 with Quiz King?
They actually talked about picking up Super Slap btw
They were trying to make peach relevant LUL
she had her time in SNES
Her joining my party is too much
Shocker is like 26 frames later to time
Finale to this mighty salty run back
If the implication of this area is that Smithy is massproduced, who manufactures him?

Nah rain is goated, especially when inside
Rain is good cause I don't have to water my outdoor plants
If it's raining inside you should probably get that checked out Kappa

I got 1 at home lolol

Whats weird is I bought the special research and it just wont show up
I spent 1 whole dollar on that research
See if he has a dollar, he could've used it to prevent timeout
All the good items up front lol
You neglected to pick up Hammer Throw, didn't you?
Who dropped their cake in there
Pokémon chatters are the worst I swear, bros just said gouging fire is trash KEKW
And just because only one had it, got to finals, and of course, dunked on by urshifu as always
ello! how is the race going?
They need to make lime flavored
Omg why they just explode him now?
My gourmet guy goes into the details about why it was good
then they run around and take off
adam was fighting heart when u was fighting jr
oh yeah i didn't look at the tracker whoops
Don't forget to do a pit run Madge
i got to pirates fortress in mm and gave up because i kept getting caught, definitely should have practiced a bit more (like at all) before jumpiong back into MM but it was fun, and i played better than i expected to up til that point
my brother got invited to a combine for the professional soccer team in vegas

hes gotta be good enough to get signed tho
phantom I'm DNFing where was the last fortress key
ngl i was gone for a hour so idk
i left and come back and you was in go mode
I believe Russ T had a Fortress KEy
it was a block just before tubba castle
Darn missed the ending what was ur placement?
did you get free pizza cuz  of it?
Costco jacked up my order… I ordered a hotdog (with drink) and chicken bake and I got 2 hotdogs and 1 drink…
Nsingman finished about a minute ago
i had pizza hut burn my 2 pizza and they send me the whole order again even the pop and beard sticks and they was like do whatever u want with the 2 pizza
it was fine as leftover so hey didn't taste like burn pizza
Hello flu boy here reminding everyone that the flu sucks
I’ve been feeling like death since last night and now I finally stopped dying
constantly reminding myself to hydrate is what stopped it
anyway chilling and probably gonna sleep as I lurk phanto274GL
"out of logic but I'm gonna do it anyway"
I am existing and enjoying the world's atmosphere :)
Also weather has been nuts the past few days, apparently there's a tornado warning in California???
i miss it where was bombette
what does the 315 next to Paper Mario randomizer (N64) mean?
what’s next to the record on the tracker?
i think the thai place messed up my order
and made it hotter than i wanted
fuck I forget the emote LOL
I just woke up from a god tier nap
we're considering throwing a freezer in my living space (basement)
I admit, the idea of ice cold vodka and ice bars in the luxury of my room is VERY tempting
in addition to, y'know, having a freezer for storing food
Nah a freezer of just alch is all a person needs
white onions is good on pizza
dominos making me look bad for repping their company phanto274Rage
they did that to me at gdq except with anchovies and olives.. I ordered pepperoni phanto274Smile
my friend would always get bacon mushrooms and white onions on pizza its was good
pizza sounds so good right now
I had a fat steak earlier tho
can i have some steak too? phanto274ColonD
I love steak like it’s no one’s business
i had roast pork for dinner pretty sure we have leftovers
I've converted too many people onto spinach tomatoes and garlic (onions and peppers optional)
HOLD up spinach is good on pizza but only on pizza
9 times out of 10 i just get a pep pizza
my older brother does chicken spinach tomatoes (garlic optional)
the only tomato I do is ketchup
I eat that shit by the gallon
I'm not crazy about Meat Lover's
i actually hate anything tomatoes beside pizza sauce
i don’t eat them either hahha
I used to hate veggies, but eating bitter stuff made me develop a taste for them
I have to use a special supplement bc I have the palette of a small child
Glitchless and I died to the lava bubble in volcano LUL
i only like cauliflower broccoli and carrots
i would eat mushrooms on a pizza but only on a pizza
they’re sweeter as the name implies and has a lot of natural flavor
Also, in rando I skipped the left tree on the beach which had storeroom key NotLikeThis
grandpa throws brown sugar in his chili
Laki -> 3rd tubba key in winding path
its starting to get cold af in my room
i only have shorts on rn
I did an escape room the other day and I solved a puzzle all on my own monadoC but we didn’t escape in the end monadoHands
We were two solves away from escaping
i want to go to the mall there
dreaded was talking about an airbnb
but staying on property is sooooo clutch tho
am i gonna have to pay an arm and leg for parking again
it was 35 bucks a night to park
i might get a suite with a kitchen tbh
i have a hilton card, i can book seperately and save tons of money
I'd like to cook mire, but I'm usually away from home
he says, as he has a piece of chicken marinating in the fridge
Phantom, you can't just Shooting Star all your problems
I cook any and all soul food
vegetable oil w/ jerk seasoning and chili powder
put some respect on greens, that a [EXPLETIVE]-folk classic right there
I do my ancestors bad when I don’t cook em
when I was a child, I threw some greens in my backpack during dinner cuz I didn't want to eat them
you'd think after every holiday ive lived i would have eaten greens by now
it STINKS when its being cooked
it doesnt come near my plate for that reason
i was the person who walked off with a giant plate of meat
I'm convinced we're not eating / talking about the same greens
my mum's greens don't smell nor taste like ass, is my point
i bet mines dont either but i refuse to try them NiceSoftlock
slide 'em over, I'll test 'em myslef
Greens aren't THE priority, but I won't turn 'em down
then again, you can't eat everyone's cookin'
regular mac but even macaroni salid
i dont eat anything but chicken tenders while im out so im pretty sure my opinion isnt a strong one
we getting biscuits with our order, or we ain't getin' popeyes
Watt should get an attack buff when hit with thunder / electricity
they dont have chicken tenders FeelsBadgeMan
I ‘ve been going to one often enough to the point staff recognizes me and knows my order monadoKEK
they got chicken pot pie soup tho, which has quickly become one of my food addictions
okay this is gonna sound really childish
but i dont like soup/sandwiches bc it means different food groups are touching
dipping the sammich into the soup is SO damn tasty
i hate that im this sensory with food
it depends on the food, imo
what about dipping fries into a wendy frosty
my job sells ramen cups for less than a dollar and we have hella spices in the break room, so I've been fiending
tho I'd like some ACTUAL ramen
hating stuff that's too salty is just correct
damn that cutscene is still slow phanto274Smile
heya fam. congrats again on todays race! phanto274Jam
welcome into a 3rd yes 3rd rando
we were yeah, rigby finished around 6 hours. I was more concerned with learning checks so after 8 hours I finished all 8 gyms and called quits
you just reenter, I did all the cheeecks there
It's on the game description page, isn't it?
It's the first item in the list of "what other changes are made to the game"
also our abandoned ship was double dip. After dive you go for heat badge and strength, then go back later for key 1 for rain badge. Also feather badge was on victory road
Point being: don't say something isn't documented if it's in the most obvious documentation
I would prob review the one place I think it be at first
everdrive has a clock? so like berries will work?
Imagine jumping blindly into a rando without reading the FAQ
And why doesn't web generation work for you?
i dont like the website either
I made a seed on the web site once but have no idea how I did it. Locally actually makes sense
I guess it's a bit of a different flow if you're playing solo on console
also when you make an emerald seed does it automatically open in bizhawk for you too?
I've never used Archipelago for a solo rando bc that's not what it's primarily intended for
i think it also have red and blue item rando on there
ive been asking for an emerald key item rando for awhile so ill take what I can get
my longshot was looked in someone red and he was working so i cheated
what kinda stuff does it add?
oh you did an emerald rando yesterday
good thing combo rando wont be on archipelago
i wouldn't mind it so much but bizhawk is shit
my pc is ass so every time I try to record something on dolphin I get at least one or two instances of everything crashing
when it does work, it is... unstable
sup dawg hope rando has been fun
i tried using bizhawk for super mario world when i was like 12... it was miserable
should of use snes9x for that
i didn't know it existed at the time
i just went with bizhawk because i'd always watch nathanisbored's let's glitch super mario world vids and I wanted to do that stuff
that dream did not last so long
i use to play rom hacks of smw as a kid i always use zsnes for the rewinds
you could try VBA RR KEKW
oh boy 74 whole points left
what happens at 1000 hours of pape rando?
at 1000 hours this axl person get un vip Kappa
i mean im sitting at 90K, i could just redeem it again
9k more points then i will be at half a mil
i have 700k in jcogs LOL
I had 300k in coneys chat at the start of tonight but then he did saltybet kazamsCatglub
i've got 242k that im just chillin' on in here right now
its g r e a t
even if i dont talk too much, i like hanging out here phanto274Smile
I almost cried and had a heart attack and screamed and hollered when i heard that sound effect
I am doing homework so it brought me great despair
But you were just having yourself a nice little nap !
the one thing from wendy's i care about is the baconator but it's so expensive that I might as well just get a burger somewhere else
everything else is like, i'll eat it if someone buys it for me
i really like the cheesy cheddar burgers
i haven't been to jack in like 15 years
i loved their crispy chicken Caesar wrap and im still sad its gone
i considered getting some when they dropped the snoop dogg meal, whatever it's called, but like... that was so expensive for what you got
i hear they used to have some insane deals but y'know... nothing gold can stay :)
mcdonald's is absolutely worth it when you have the app and you know what ur doing
the food is so good tho Sadge
i've gotten some crazy deals from mcd's in the past
lmao yeah. mcd's is food and not much else
mcdonalds app has $650 combo meal, double bacon P w/ cheese. only time i ever eat there
i just got 10 pc nugget lg fires and a ice coffee  so good
hot take, but burger king has some good deals
if you live in the united states, burger king is never worth it
i like to think i have an iron stomach and that shit fucks me up every time
stomachaches for days and it tastes like ass
the last time I had Burger King, it reminded me WHY I don't eat Burger King anymore
even in canada burger king is mid
they have a pretty good chicken sammie
@blacktiger51 that's just it, it's MID
BK in the US is outright BAD
Sour Watermelon Rouge Energy, my BELOVED
Bk does have a decent milkshake
what up phantom, i watch your youtube videos all the time thanks for the content
ya seems like its been pretty rough
wait when did you find bow
regrettably, i stand by taco bell even if their prices get incrementally worse and the food quality doesn't get better
it's pretty good, but like, it's gotten way more expensive since 2019
......... that was 5 years ago!
and the beefy 5 layer is getting up there
you can get all those things in the cravings box though
and the cravings box has pretty good value in most places. some franchises will screw you over on the pricing though
all this food talk is making me hungy
hmmm, not the build your own cravings box
no yeah that's why I just... don't get other boxes. they're usually badly priced too
THANK YOU. breadcrumbs on mac n cheese are so bad
i said i wasnt gonna eat tonight and now i really want mac
i use to be able to get a box thing for 5 bucks that come with 2 tacos kfc fries and a apple pie then you could add extra tacos for 1 buck so i add 2 and get a drink for under 10 bucks now its like 16 bucks for all that like wtf
where is this go mode item
my Bedge is calling me but we so close to being done
i mean there' sno man doll
surely it cannot take much longer 4Head
i gtg but i hope you find what you're looking for
no details obvs, but interesting to see how two ppl go about the same seed differently
i have the attention span of a turtle
hell yeah we were playing bug fables
i had a seed the other night where i was bottlenecked by ultrahammer because i forgot the block in the spiny room was a superblock LUL
yeah little stuff like thats gets me all the time
i also screwed myself another seed because i forgot where the renewable cake-mix was
i really should have a notepad open when i play rando LUL
im definetly gonna need one when i try the DK64 rando soon LUL
are there boss shuffle randos where final bowser moves locations?
just shuffle the whole ass room
was just thinking abt going to final bowser and getting tutankoopa
if you do that you gotta include gooba king asachiTotalSmug
like cmon we need to have goomba king do something in rando more KEKW
i am about to raid my Bedge that where i am going
I'm here for the resets to bad quils or espy
We don't need it but up to you
As long as you know it's runnable
all 6 party members i care
If I can't see every party member's friendship rising I'll riot
also marcoGL beestGLGLGL majinGlad brugglGold marcoGL_HF
For anyone who doesn't know this is mandatory for the program to get your rng seed
it's useful to have stats up but only if chat actually knows enough to know if quilava will outspeed or something
I remember when I didn't have the rng burn and I had to roll like 110 times swifFlop
if you get it first try I will pog out of my mind dude
If this is first try the game hates me
What's minimum IV's to run Espeon?
Sounds like the perfect beginning to a speedrun YEP
Hp as in hidden power not health
fair, wasn't sure what the min SpA and Spd were
The main main thing is to get a good quil more than espeon
Fair, which there is no manip for YEP
This is to advance rng KEKW it's not go time
Forfeiting to a Bug/Grass trainer with Ho-oh and Charizard in the lead, seems like the only reasonable play YEP
Wait 2 frames of good ones?
Use him to heal your other mons phanto274Smile
yo phantom i was excited to see you announce you were doing runs of this. one of my favorite games as a kid :D
At least your reset music is great KEKW
At least it's the quicker of the 2
god i used to watch this forever ago and there was no manip for this so people would just sometimes reset for 4 hours and not get a runnable espeon KEKW
yeah he was DMing me about it cause I asked him to look into another game but he was busy with this
I'm more thinking as to how the fuck did they find this KEKW
Damn this game is so good
wdym HP Bug isn't going to get it done
You're telling me the physical low base power move on the special attacking pokemon wouldn't do it Clueless
Although I don't know if I've seen enough of a run to know who attacks the most
These are wild that they even exist
are we gonna be a based typhlosion chad or a cringagatr
assuming you did your cheating manips right
johnstone is just doing a living dex run of this game rn
bro is catching the delibird rn
bro isn't even doing the master ball dupe
bro his whole team gets roasted by charizard
seedot looks like an acorn it would not be a tasty snack
it would be a bitter nasty little tengu seed
Everyone in Orre is on the juice right
how TF Gonzap lookin' like that
did you get the right umbreon?
we gonna see some sick bite damage?
Real umbreon gamers teach their umbreon toxic
DID YOU KNOW GAMING UMBREON WA SSUPPOSED TO BE POISON TYPE
BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO RUIN THE TYPE CHART?
THIS WAS THE ONLY POKEMON GAME THEY LET YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
THAT DUDES ON THE JUICE FR
i was on caps lock wtf
Es Cade aint on the juice he's on something worse
you need to combine the mcdonalds with the juice to get the gains
Chat are these glitches for real?
you get the juice for ur typhlosion
They dont need balls that much in Arizona
you have to set out cheese for bait to capture a sandshrew out there
you dont need balls because they're on the juice
Fun trivia fact Lotad was drawn by a child in a magazine contest
omg ur running the best pokemon gams ever blkkatGasper
yo why is your makuhita incel type?
Dude they need to bring back shadow lugia alueivDance
Do you catch any shadows in any %?
omg catching the legendaries was a pain in this blkkatKEKW
I remember the first time I played this game, as a child, I didn't try to capture any pokemon until the Miror B. fight
let's see if we get a good quilava
cheating? welp i'm out cya it was fun
this games graphic studio and soundtrack team went all in for this game so good blkkatGasper
yo u can catch in ground wild blkkatChinchillLurk
let's see if we got a real one
dude if it was shiny would be crazy lol
was a good run umbreon thats my fav mon yewfGato
The split has him named Santa clause
As a kid I would have NEVER expected him to be the TRUE final boss
that's quite a few drinks on the table
liquid was a cool twist alueivDance
wes the most fly portag lol
Barboach looks like a fun arts and crafts project with just a balloon and a water bottle.
dude i love this music so hypw
bagon would make some tasty fried chikcne
I'm stuck in an ad and dont get to see the streamer reaction
Bagon maybe a little gamey though?
even chickens can be gamey if you're eating an old rooster and not one of those genetic freak crime against nature broilers
I did my first run with typhlosion i believe and then tried again with meganium was fun
I think I reset after realizing I missed so many good pokemon as a kid, don't remember for sure though.
i liked using meganium cuz they can tank earthquake and do it back lol
voltorb is already cringing they didn't see the need to make it a shadow type
The music in this game and XD is so good
that doduo is doin' a little PogChamp
Swablu has sick nasty special defense that's why the cloudy feathers are for
i'm reporting the stream for gratuitous violence
look how you hurt that spheal
it's a radish.... but it's kinda odd.....
it's a shrew.... but the back is coated in sand.....
if you dont take out that snadshrew right now it will decimate ur team
one of these is the Mantine, right?
they needed the lowbie remoraid to evolve the manytke
why they make the luvdisc that sad
how could you do it to them
just throw a pokeball at it
oh snap ya catching that ? thats a good mon
@needaname37 yea i know this the whole team
mantine was on my team back in day just saying lo
Lost you time out of spite
back in the day it was espeon typhlosion all 3 dogs and tyranitar
i'm not logging in till after la mulana tonight
so if someone finds me titans mitts, i can get your heat emblem
girl is in full cosplay guarding the secret gang's cave
would bagon do well free ranging in a coop and run?
bro another ad when i ask about bagon
Why meditite again? is it for held item?
oh it’s twisted spoon isn’t it
meditite makes a journey once in its life to mt. coronoet in the sinnoh region
Look at that lovey spoon for your Espeon 🥄
you have a good sosh dude?
Rider sosh? I barely know her tho
mareep is a good pokemon to keep you get milk, tallow, and wool for compost
and in this game surviving is a must lol
need the CAD files to injection mold my own Beldum
dudes prob gonna spam rain lol
Hot take I think the XD theme is better even though I still like this one
that wasn't digging a hole that was phasing through it like this was skyrim
good ole Pokémon Stadium ass move animation
i still vastly prefer his XD theme but the Colosseum one's still a bop
if this was 2016 internet we would all post "cringe"
that's 7 more fights than i've ever used a plusle in
duking doesnt need a plusle to defend himself after he found a dealer for his research chems
nobody in Agate village is juiced though since the old heads know that shit will kill ya
this is the pokemon area where you find an old woman whose boyfriend is a mightyena
do not post to pokemon's official twitter account
I need to go shopping but gl with the rng fest Phantom phanto274Bless
you laugh but a hp fire off blaze would be fckn sick
wasnt there a youtube video where they showed the pikachu winning this fight?
ur shadow rush is physical rn?
damn that quilava got a BOOTY
in pokemon legends celebi we will visit the agate forest
time to replace with entei then
popping in to drop this ooc quote
I realize there's some overlap between" furry"and "monster fucker"
bro i go afk, come back, and suddenly we got the big BADGER
we're at the point in the game where we're fighting gravelers, not geodudes
outrageous that they thought a 100 battle challenge was okay
"it doesnt matter now" suddenly 2 hours over WR
my wii almost roasted itself and I saw some cool artisanal, wild caught corruptions from it.
the fan was dusty from not being turned on in 2/3 years
This game sucks there's no agumon
I need his big ass head to be present
both wii media players struggle to run standard off the shelf x265 files
I have to re-encode to watch my cartoons on an authentic CRT
I like shoving random things in my soda cans once im done with themto add impurities to the recycler's mix
bro fucking owned u ur destroyed kid
just takes while to head back
look at that monster on platform 10
Anyone else get a pump before battling pokemon gym leaders with your legendaries?
rated E10 for mild cartoon violence
did u know u can connect dualshock 4 playstation controllers to the nintendo wii and play gamecube games with it
are you playing pokemon colosseum on a dualshock 4 rn?
I had this game on gamecube! Loved it didn't know you'd run it
just got another ad, enjoy your 3 cents from this phantom
when you accidently rematch him again he will have a level 60 burned guts swellow
then it will be over 4 u
that is japanese signage.... so cyberpunk.....
EIN is only on research chems
YOU SOLD TOXIC? UMBREON COULDA USED THAT
they were so loyal to the source material.... except for shadow pokemon being cringe....
bro now curtissimo comes live with kirby 64 what have you done phantom it's spreading.
I followed him when he was playing that new F zero
3 rare candies in a box was the most PogChamp moment of this game
is that steelix was shadow you could Stealix it
bro that cell phone crusher guy just cracked an apple vision pro into pieces
at least the glass is laminated so it wont cut up your face if you do that accidently
bro it broke just from the scratch test
this thing is flimsy as eff
why is thtat jigglypuff not shadow
ive seen waht it can do in melee
imagine being an evil shadow stantler and eventually growing as a person until ur a wyrdeer
it would mess up the pathing
you could bake that pile of swine for its lard
let me guess who the murderer was
imagine calling your evil train the SHADOW LINER
not doing the under colosseum for a SICK togetic?
or u just gonna steal that dudes?
wild that he gives you a worse elekid if u evolve it
shadow aipom? aren't all monkeys just like that regularly?
Yes I am back great outing and munching. How is the route?
oh so u decided no stats
Will you run gale of darkness?
a different sort of question but did u ever try the hello kitty form of tetris?
it is such an interesting concept and i like the penalty system.
So what happens if you get a shiny in a run
You dont catch any shadow pokemon?
Oh yeah you get qualava as a shadow I fogot
Espeon is so op in this game
I transferred between this game and emerald 🤣 via gba
It was cool to see kyogre in the mainstage fights 🤣
Anyway to get back in blaze?
meditite is getting purified a lot this run
dw u cant accidentally give umbreon earthquake.
Why he need to be dead?
Does it help to decide what they send first?
bro that porygon's model is fucked up
The milk has gone bad Sadge
put it out of its misery
Typhlosion getting flamethrower so late before HG/SS is a travesty
unless I missed an X Defend lmao
I finished my first emerald seed!!
At least they're focusing the weak side Prayge
I forgot about the shadow metagross
That would make more sense to swap Typhlosion in maybe? Hmm
You did use x special on makuhita and then didn't attack with espeon?
Emerald Seed I did. Ill send you the patch and yaml settings later.
did it die somewhere it wouldn’t have got attack EV’s?
Or maybe Houndoom rolling a plus def nature
Yeah I’m not pulling the calc out I’m just surprised it lived since Houndoom’s bull is poor
It must assume makuhita dies cause it’s an instant kill
that’s the last boss too Clueless
3 fire blast hits EZ Clap
always threw me he could fly KEKW
thank you no sandstorm SpDef boost
Oh nice we get Ho Oh as part of the timing
Oh god that probably wasn't a drone copter KEKW
I never considered that before Aware

I am looking forward to it FeelsGoodMan
I think I already praised this games ost today
which is good because you spend so much time battling
o think she lost all cards but I missed how
I didn't know that the pokeballs didn't get used I sweating at first
why is first on cooldown I wanna be FIRST
I'm unfamiliar with what you're doing. Are you just fishing for a good team comp?
yo this rich boy got a cacnea
and that doesn't count against time?
you go through all of that and THEN you have to hit a frame-perfect input? yikes.
wait it'll even tell you how many frames you were off? Wow.
that girl on the title screen had some bug eyes monkaS
Oh don't need much at all
oh right HP has variable BP as well in this gen
right, I figured that. Do they not increment once per frame?
because if it's 435 increments you need, this seems like it would chew through that real fast
my man has two Zigzagoons and decided to not evolve either of them?
no Willie, you don't need seasoning, you need to evolve.
they just dropped that body bag like it was a pack of pillows
wait, gen3 was still certain types are special/physical?
didn't play gen3 as a kid
and ghost is for some stupid reason physical
just allowing your fast gengar to set up for your slow special attacking partner to hit harder 10% of the time
Well the only ghost move in gen 1 was what lick
It makes sense for it to be phys
dude looks like human mr krabs
they’re the guys we terrorized with explosives and mugged
so are we catching the shadow Pokémon or are we just catching the starter and sweeping
have you ever done a randomizer of this game
for the first time ever I had to go without gas ⛽️ for a day. it was sleepless and chilly 🥶
it is now we are up 🆙 and running 🏃‍♂️
how bad is the manip for this game, i remember being told its not fun
wait you can snag when they dig?
yeah 👍 pokeball dimension phases all elements
i'd be down to learn for sure tho, this game has been on my list to learn for a while. but i just committed myself to routing magic pengel since from what i've found it could be a sub 4 hour run
its a 8-15 hour game casually
and it has no src page so its a free WR technically WICKED
be right back my dinner showed up
the names are hilariously bad in this game even compared to other Pokemon games
i want another colo pokemon game
Yeah those names are questionable lol
there’s a joke I could make with that name but I’m gonna keep my mouth shut
this and xd were the only time i cared about story in a pokemon game
even legends couldnt keep me interested in the story past the time travel bit
I found a shiny hippowdon in my file of Pokémon arceus and I wasn’t even looking for it
i found too many shiny pokemon in arceus
all my shinies in scarlet and violet are from wonder trades
i mean i like that they seem to have increased the chances of finding them, but it also kind of ruins finding them
why can’t this remoraid be the shadow one
that’s a real cool oldish attack animation
you both jump off the roof to battle here
u cant do the full heal target glitch nooooooo
pretty sure the strongest Pokémon we’ve fought was that mantine and that cool oddish, everything else is pathetic
espeons attack fell whyd u use return
he has a b*dass twisted spoon meditite
They really got away with that "Shoot!"
the ESRB rating is just E, not E10
what is that guys catch rate
the best Pokémon ever dunsparce and my favourite
At least you can evolve him now
I mean he technically did get better
time for the best fight in the game
why steal plusle of all things
hey it’s the magic happy place
if I remember that kirlia is one level away
is it possible for pikachu to win
Yooo Phantom phanto274BLANKIES good luck! How have things been today? phanto274Smile
Very nice! I just woke up from a nap and one of your vods was on, and i was like damn phantoms live iceblueGoMode
now quilava isn’t evil he’s just joined the terrorist group
We need the experience and the attacks to land
plusle is still in our team
The music in this game is so good phanto274Jam
shall we dance on these 10 floors
no lie he should have been a machamp 2 armer.
mans just slapped him silly monadoBonk
Also dang the RNG manip must have gone well gl gl!
killing entei instead of capturing hurts me a lil
Look away for Suicune and Raikou too Stavros phanto274Cry
at least they were dumb with attract
no way this game has a manip too NotLikeThis also yo gl
Sneasel needs Fire Blast? That's surprising to me
I was gonna say it must be close
I hate when I blow up a room, creating a giant impassable fissure that my enemies can't cross only to leave them a key to get in another way
oh right I forgot about this tech
Just in time to see you beat Skrub. Kappa LUL
Is Ein the most normal name in this entire game? LUL
Still good time save and if end goes well there's a big time save there too
But I like to wait for multiple minutes to ferry only 5 people through a door at a time
U forget gonzap split again lol
Oh nice I made it in time for the fun fight
People can say what they want about this game, but the AI is SMART
my fave shadow pokemon and my fave gold star owned card
There was a couple extra fights too
Have a good night, thanks for stream phanto274Smile
bye all perfexct strim as always
hi, so I didn't watch your first runs, but I have to ask: how is the manip?
it's mostly a manip I find insane from a technical standpoint cause it's on gc which is rare because most gc/wii games seeds correctly which this one does, but the manip is a seed recovery
gonna train myself to get 9990 in snow whirled during this
took I think like 3 months total of dev or something?
I wish I could remake the program in avalonia....but bug fables takes all my times :(
Qt's toolkit is....it works, but tbh it's harder to get it right
yeah high dpi is a problem
avalonia and C# are much nicer to maintain and don't have these problems as much
ik you can do high dpi stuff with Qt, but I just never learned how
Last night I curious, so I did an off stream emerald seed without using the map tracker and I actually finished. I was mad I didnt local record it LUL
one thing with this manip that's kind of weird: frequently, you'll get a cluster of 3/4 in a row to be a good seed and you hit the 1/4 bad one
at the meterroite I ran into a wonder guard and had to chip damage with sand stream
the program hides that umbreon is generated first so the espeon can get overap with similar rolls cause they align
I sent you some stuff to help with emerald too
one dog pokemon to watch his ride, and another by his side helping him steal shit
xd's manip is the same, but you enter 2 numbers and it's 2-4 passes only
I heard that colossuem was made difficult to combat rentals companies.
Is this all to setup the manip?
Throw the whole speedgame in the trash
The worst thing I've ever heard
I'd rather speedrun Z1 for a sub 28
I saw someone manip all shiny captures on this game on yt. Took them forever 🤣
Finally get to umm rider willy 🤣
team rocket 🚀 kills off all newcomers speedrunning bc even the manip won’t stop protect and explosion 💥 critical
Should have a gamba on how many fire blast misses there are 🤣
"Too bad to keep going" point
You should get a shiny qualava in this run
I knew I could count on you
hope to see that oddish dance ahain
Wait does the rng manip make it impossible for the qualava to be shiny lolol
what the heck was up with that guys hair?
was not paying attention to that
Where table so I can see if W or L
Eh it's fine either way you have the minimum for a good one anyways
no why did rants use imprison
AI in this game is mostly if you don't attack they don't attack
Just get better it ain't my fault
that went pretty well still now onto the oddish
so espeon and quilava are front in line makuhita is the mascot, meditite is support and plusle is backup, am I right?
and umbreon is the couch surfer
blaze with no flame wheel nice
now you can sweep the rest of this area thanks to oddish
it’s ok makuhita is a wall
all set and at home time to enjoy a strea with my besty
watch out for the mantine, the only Pokémon with a bst higher then 400 so far
don’t worry you’re about to crit everything in the next 4 areas
So how is this run's Umbreon?
this became such a run C!@#Blocker
no wait put the music back
They should put this theme in all games
why is this song so good
miror b knows what records to play
knew it was gonna be tough
I like this game a ton as a kid, but replaying it made me realize how slow the combat is
there is a romhack of it, I played it on 110%, it was bareable by that
also sorry, I am playing Splatoon rn
it is pretty good actually, more difficult, physical/special split, fairy type plus a ton of more avaible pokemon and new moves
but that is pokemon speedrunning, rng is a huge factor on it
so I've learned, I never activly speed run a game
kinda fun to see a typhlosion outspeed espeon tbh
I guess it depends on your SpA stat as well
I forgot when they changed that tbh
they changed it in gen 5
tome for new notes I guess
the area really has a nice vibe to it
I played a bit of the first xenogears
but other than that, I love the Xenoblade series
the 3, when there are 4 LUL
You wouldn't like it anyways unless you're a yu gi oh fan
Well it was master duel KEKW
i have over 600 hours in master duel
Well you'd be happy to know swordsoul is out for free
Bronze 4 on 4 new accounts here we go swifLFG
As long as it gets me full swordsoul, worth it
Dueling twice at the same time is not something I recommend
Specially playing naturia on one and swordsoul on the other KEKW
take the attack down a notch
are X items +1 or +2 in this game?
Game said no all run long Vibes.
now everything falls apart, that's a shame
do you know if this game has the same catch rates as GBA?
wow, is ORAS rayquaza was changed from 3 to 45
Oh hey it's the one Pokemon game that doesn't run like hot garbage on Switch
U trying to speed run, let's go, and coliseum???
I haven't touched let's go since the year it released but I do enjoy watching runs of it
I followed in late Oct 2021 when you started BN6 and lets go wasnt long after that
How did Colosseum go? I napped lol
Damn sounds like it was awful
Hopefully this goes nicer for you. So any more Colosseum runs?
Oh nice. Maybe do a mix of Colosseum and xd  😁
There's a manip on that one too?!
Wow did not know that. It only had 20 sp A tho didn't it? Was just a speedy one
Oh well then.... that doesn't make sense then
There any manips for this game?
what is a literal child doing my himself in a cave?
I'm am the ghost of the fallen cubones and I have come to steal your soul if you fail 3 out of 6 trivia question muhhahaha
Making a spread sheet for the first 3 gens catch rate so I have a general idea or how simple or difficult they should be
The rules 1. 5 guesses per mon 2 1 hint per mon effects may apply this is a game for your soul after all 3 you must have a overall score of 4 to keep you soul are you ready to begin? There is a 2nd lis or rules if ud wish to let chat par take
I put everything at max catch rate then sweep the game with whatever legendary is a surf encounter
100 has been my base line
I believe you can avoid spinners by pause buffering but not sure how difficult it is
I saw someone who's done lots of gen 3 speedruns doing it in rando so I assume there's a way to be consistent
Imagine trying to sneak past a spinner in multiworld and game stops you to say "Billy sent you a potion" then you get caught by the spinner LUL
Wait so in let's go eevee blue has Pikachu?
Well you understood regardless LUL I'm ignorant in let's go lore
youll see blue later on SS anne
Why can't this one evolve then Madge
Our starter is special and has +100 BST from others of its species
So basically good enough to train your sweeper
only 55 from gen 1 have a catch rate over 100, granted alot of those are ones you arent intended to catch like final stages
Yeah a Pikachu or eevee solo run even if it's +100 bst is kinda uh, well mid
Electric + Water is still pretty solid coverage
yeah, the fire move always burn, water always heals, elec always stuns, ect.
Thank God we hate that rat around here
phantom, imagine if baddy bad always caused flinch KEKW
Look at the bright side spinners aren't as fucked as in bdsp
Yeah spinners don't make any fucking sense really KEKW
I'm glad they became optional in this Gen and hopefully onwards
Im curious on how the emerald blind trainer setting works
There are good items but items aren't very necessary a lot of the time in S/V
I remember some of the held items were locked behind trainers too
I guess a lot of them can be bought but I want to say some of them were only in shops after beating the game
gl gl, how did Colo treat you?
stream was good, could have had 1:06:xx tonight
I thought there were more but I guess Eviolite was the only major one that's only available from trainers before postgame
was a minute ahead entering timelossus
Some also only appear in shops after a certain number of badges
and the 2 seconds ahead after armory and weston boo
Also the TMs are good but idk if any of them were exclusive
Earthquake was a trainer TM, 'nuff said
honestly if i actually practice boolossus and area 4 i could 1:05
None of the TMs were bad per se (except maybe Aerial Ace) but not really necessary in most cases either
Blizzard, Hydro Pump, Leaf Storm, Flare Blitz were among them
More singles than doubles I suppose
I just learned how to start with 99 rare candies
r u excited for pokemon let's go Wooper?
uh oh phantom has become a doubles chud
does champion trace have ~that~ pokemon?
I need a list of trainers who have one...
does giovanni have one in this game?
in his FR/LG battle they are both still rhyhorns
in his pokemon world tournament appearances it is evolved into a rhyperior....
You will never get a voltorb early
you will never have a custom SLOWPOKE kigurumi and battle new trainers in dark cave wearing it
You'll battle one in dark cave when let's go togepi comes out
unless u get lets go wooper instead
make sure u send supportive messages to ur nidoKING :)
muk crawled out of those bedsheets
This is the gym that made playing this game worth it
this is the gym that made MAKING this game worth it
this gym caught me off guard when i first played
DONT WASTE IT ON A WATER TYPE POKEMON?
WHAT IF I HAVE A VOLCANION?
so yesterday my local shop got a complete in box TMC listed for 200
sealed copy of xenoblade 3DS for 40, you cant even give that shit away LUL
I threw away all my gameboy game boxes the day i got them as a kid
i can vividly remember opening up leafgreen version
then disc games taught us all to keep the boxes
Oh nice they are. Was this game actually good?
btw tmc box only is worth 108.70 usd
Well tbf I haven't played a pokemon game since Diamond and Pearl
So I can't argue with you LUL
and you only use those joy cons for this game right?
do they have the based new hall effect sticks?
im just eager to see nintendos next controller
and pls dont be 80 bucks
and ship with a controller I actually want, dont make me buy it seperately
The controller for the Hyper Nintendo Entertainment System will be the Switch pro and wiimote controllers
i gotta go sleep but it was nice watching the stream! I hope the rest of the run goes well!
dont remember who I saw do this but you can use a rare candy to revive a fainted pokemon then heal it back up
that must be where I saw it then
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed trainers, and fellow Pokémon enthusiasts, Today, we gather here to pay our heartfelt tribute to a Pokémon that has left an indelible mark on our journey—a Pikachu that, despite our best efforts, was boxed and has now departed from our party. In the face of this loss, we find solace in the memories we shared, the battles fought, and the bond we formed, however brief it may have been. Thank you, Pikachu and screw you, Phantom. Cheer100
gonna dip here, have a good night
He's good for like most of the elite 4
What's the ideal time for a run
So just a pikachu and starmie
nice back in time for the e4
i wont be mad if you don't finish
strim was fun, had an all cards run that was good until it wasn't NiceSoftlock
Apparently 10% of stream was spent talking about potatoes
yeah potatoes came up on I think 3 separate occasions LUL
i think i was responsible for 2 of them
JCog actually forced one of her viewers to cook a potato during the stream D:
imagine replacing Blue with this loser
you're gonna eat this potato and you're gonna (not) like it!!
i had to, or risk her leaking my address and sin number pepeW
I mean it was indeed edible
My fav part is entering champion
I think this is the best champion theme
and entering champion is literally 10/10 goosebumps
is it you that's being recommended to me on insta? LUL
YEP only for about 6 months
what are they worth if you're just really cool?
NOTED but i am broke lol
think its Bedge time for me after you raid
ggs, thanks for the good lurk
my finger is on close page
i got the persona 3 remake
it fix a lot of the issue i had for the og version
it's like a slightly toned down p5r
the big 1 you can control your party members
they added all out attacks too
dungeons are better, not as good as p5 ofc
looking to an upscale of p4 though
makes you really appreciate p5 tbh
i played p5 1st also but i do really liked 4 golden
yeah i played a couple hours of p4g years ago, then dropped it quick, 100%'d p5 and then 100%'d p5r and now am playing p3 for the first time
i got the palatium for royal
you can get by doing tartarus 1-2 times a month
i only got to floor 10 so far
yeah, had to call it early. stopped at the start of FreezeMan's scenario
Yeah, still dry throat but I'm able to scream at Pallos
i haven't played LADX in so long
it's okay. we didn't see that
Boomerang kills deathl in 1 hit phanto274Smile
I’ve never played or seen this game so I have no clue what’s good
I’ve played breath of the wild and that’s it
those boulders seem a bit targeted to you
which letter? i hope its the E
they should add the flying items into the rando pool
what’s the point of a boat ride if you can swim
why was they’re a walrus chilling
i know chain chomp is an Easter egg but why is the chain chomp an item
which dungeon is face key for
aren’t bombs found everywhere or do you need to find a satchel or something for them
It's like that meme, "you can see sound"
"plays sick tunes" "hah, made ya look"
Mario sacrificed himself for your allowance
will be in and out but awsm ur playing my fave of all fave games
I’ll be right back I’m gonna real quick google the map of this game
Is the boomerang damage a rando change or is that item just busted in LA
the best Easter 🐣 egg 🥚 in history
bc they saw link 🔗 to the past players not use boomerang 🪃 much
Kirby looks different than I remember
If you talk to the kid you can run doom in zelda
Simply hit the weak spot with boomerang Kappa
I wonder if Pallos realizes that he's no longer in timeout
I mean, listening to the cave music sped up and higher pitch isn't also as special
getting all the pride instruments I see
What if I said it was my favorite boss?
why does he have the most health out of everything
So true cause my favorite boss is the big buzzblob
Petition to make egg capital "E" the Wind Fish Egg
You'll never recover from back pain
i hope you're well and glgl with rando HypeLove1
i feel like the two pear well together ngl
why is that delibird on the tracker
now you can make mewtwo your slave
Now you can find where to capture deoxys on the map
sadly this is emerald so it would be speed form
needs to be a chad firered randomizer
now you get increased speed in battle
That moon stone is for when the rayquaza ends up being a clefairy
he's part of the Sceptile community.
if you keep trying every night with your partner god will bless you with a gyarados
u got flash before dewford cave
what if each berry tree gave randomized items
what if you needed to grow berries to get key items
bro latias is doing almost as much damage at level 10 as that ratata
time to capture all the fishing pokemon
this isnt a nuzlocke is it?
where's the soulful and epic webcomic to go with
I know in vanilla, if you fish in petalburg....
did you catch the typhlosion i was in an ad
All the door labels on norman's gym could be bullshit in randomizer
ur rattata needs a rare candy badly
I know mice will chew through a candy wrapper
if i redeem a link awakening can it be dungeon ER?
you can see him when you're driving
Tangrowth is an OU chad monster
there a setting where you start with 9 hearts and you lose 1 when you beat a boss that sounds toxic
Tangela using rollout would be horrifying
I got lucky and caught a level 45 rat
speed boost slaking would be AG
tangela is standing like a flustered anime girl from a slice of life anime
now go back to the cave
i just give the seed id right?
ok i think it just the seed id i gen the same seed with it
I've also started genning seeds with 99 max repel
yeah it doesn't change anything you could save and restart after every step
no i did normal setting and it gen and said shuffling d2 and dungeon ER was off
i also have the log if you get stuck whenever you do it
NOW YOU CAN RIDE UP THE SANDY SLOPES
If only there was a way to skip pokenav
the secret house in this game inspired real life entertainment venues
can you ever forgive game freak?
graveler is the most 🦀 type pokemon
I got the retroachievement for the really good cycling road time
" Going All Out (5) (14) Get a time of 9.5 seconds or lower and 0 collisions on the cycling road. "
I’m assuming moves are also randomized?
more importantly, tangela usually doesn’t learn splash at level 32
I bet you like having wonder guard black listed
I did a seed once I had kill it with sandstream
I also got the retroachievement for GRINDING OUT THE GLASS TABLE IN THIS AREA
yeah it needs to become a sneasler
Starter with extreme speed is so good
Seed i did last night shaking had facade, flamethrower, earthquake, and thunder punch LUL
kindler bernie is gonna call u and invite u to the cook out
you can't just Earthquake all your problems
he took the oras latios you get right across that river
OMG my event ended and it was sooooo good
and glad to u still on
damn that raichu got a BOOTY
find the feebas encounter in this rando
if there were charmeleons in the grass would u let the kids play outside
pokemon games dont got routes like this any more
this route is like 2 of the alola islands
this route needs darkness like a cave too
look at the gen 1 ass backsprite
this isn't the japanese version so you actually do need the devon scope to fight the gym
bubble is worse than hp water
aoe damage aint worth that much
castform should hold an item so that its a check
Random question: Have you caught a Grass-type?
You need to have a grass type in your party for one of the checks in this game
local gamers so brainrotted they cant remember the winona gym puzzle by heart any more
Ooooo cheeky little ruby sapphire run
this is emerald wtf u mean
dont you see the GREEN CLOTHES
This is my exercise for today
okay i rolled a nat 1
you NEED to go faster now
Funny how you never notice if you just one-shot everything lol
you do notice when your level 73 rayquaza just barely doesn't one shot the elite 4 pokemon
Twitch ads REALLY want me to try refrigerated dog food in plastic packets
If you are in the run animation, trainers always aggro
Without having experience doing buffers myself, I think you would have dodged the encounter if you just let go of the B button
hey what pokemon is that and what does it evolve into
In that particular case, you would've hit the trainer regardless because you were running
now you can find out what rare and exotic creatures the safari zone owner has imported
Having a riding and flowery Charmeleon is funny as heck!
they didn't need to go so hard with outside mt pyre
this game's ost is so sick
Cómo hizo para tener a entei😳
Wait, is there a setting to make it all double battles?
he traded the entei in from his previous pokemon colosseum runs
phantom dies inside when he says a singles battle
But all trainers that can turn stare you down when you run
wobbuffet with slack off would be AG in gen 3
I think frozen should have been replaced with perma slow.
Was the complaint you had with the PokeNav just that trainers still bug you randomly?
The one time you don't so the manip too
Onix not so sturdy now after being randomized
I think it's by the start
stay out of the family pond
Not sure if placebo but the manip seems to be working pretty well
you didnt get the hiker on that cutscene
if bird type was in the game blaziken would be fire/bird
bro came here without the acro bike
lax incense now u can breed a munchlax
thats still funny to see and we are 2 away!
time for the 7.8 too much water saga
castform knew poison tail because its made of chemtrails
it took me 30 minutes to notice that lol
so youre detroying my time with about 2 hours
this was the firs tone I cleared too
what arre your overall thoughts on this one?
it makes me wonder is super rod is required for logic
I learned alot from this seed so thought it would be valuable for you too
now that youre here wanna know where waterfall was?
spoiler log said it was at the top of a waterrfall KEKW
skipping magma emblem was really nice too
yeah, I screen cap'd this LUL
also thanks for pull requests, I take it I did the map stuff right?
I didnt know how to combine everything so I sent it all seperately
I thought I sent a PR for the kid in restboro apartments, its the first building to the south exit, he gives a permierr ball in vanilla. Not a big deal as long as we know about it
thats what I went with too
entei and the 2 HM slaves KEKW
yeah i stopped marking the map but use to to see when areas open up
thanks for doing this, ill prob catch the vod on mon or tues
i forgot i had monster jam this week lol
just relaxing on my day off playing that kirby pokemon hack
just went through a series of emotions
title screen -> oh no did I miss it? -> 8 minutes live -> phew
i love your paper mario videos so much
is N-chapters the any chapters or the first ones specifically?
guessing you're not doing the weekly/
swifThink to be a twitch goblin or a football dumbass
Considering my dad is a 49ers fan, yeah, I know KEKW
Yooo Phantom good luck phanto274Smile phanto274GL
Has anyone discussed about a hint distro of sorts? And by that I mean one that doesn't literally just say X has X thing
To be fair in an rpg it shouldn't matter as much
Why the fuck would you use fool bozo
Goombario sounds like an excellent idea
"tattle on where the next thing is"
making goombario have some sort of use? quizmoPog
Another good one could potentially be signs as hints as well
And besides abused it's if you get lucky ggs, if not too bad
@SwiftPichu_ I do like this one
what’s the point of that electric power if it only lasts one hit
well just had my 1st game over is persona 3 remake
debating if I want a burrito after I take a nap
my son: "Does Phantom play Paper Mario every single day?"
red key para and upgrade to finish up this seed is great
"I hope they go through a secret door again where they drop down. That's so funny"
and then you just did them
so i just realized my new router uses WPA3
cause 3DS doesn't know what the fuck WPA3 is lmao
does it not also have WPA2?
i tried to adjust it to that, reset the router, still wouldn't connect
so i'm just using a mobile hotspot from my phone since i'm just uploading a pic from colors! 3d
good idea but alas, won't help my 3DS lol
I cleared out my StreetPass a few weeks ago at work and still somehow managed to get a few more passes
I feel like chapter 2 is most of the time 7 scaled
guess u can beat chapter 2 now Kappa
watch him show up in the shop
I just thought of a really stupid addition to the randomizer where the locked doors require a Radom key
most likely that’s why it’s stupid
I rolled 2 seeds that were norman sphere 2, so Im considering start with super rod but leave it in home PC and if I need it I can go back for it. I tried start with 10 rare candies and even that wasnt enough
ill be lurkin' while i watch the usherbowl + make ribs :3
yeah and if I need it I have to spent time going home for it
what if we added more badges to the pool like you need 6 badges to fight norman?
time to go meteor shower the toy box
ill have to play around with that and see what works
locking norman behind 4 gyms is an option too but i find the badges more interesting
so second second seed norman gave knuckle badge which put steven in logic, and soda pop house had surf opening that up
so if I did the letter out of logic I wouldve been fine
and the first seed it would put cut in logic opening the woods and route 116
if you have money too, its not as cheap as lets go
a few neatly drawn boxes could help with the minesweeper tracker. gl hf btw
Wild, this long and no other partner
how do you tell the three toads apart on the tracker?
the three that look th same in a column
its the one by the castle, I forget his name
i havent touched this game in awhile lol
i never noticed thats who they are arranged
I forgot today was football day
I wanted to forget today was football
so the chain starts and ends with goompapa
i was wondering how you were gonna do this
imagine having to return here for panels
because you did the skip maybe?
I guess I missed that dialogue for minimal cutscenes
they ask you the warp question, but that should be everything
is the insecticide herb a rando thing?
icebound, thats an interresting write up you did about the minh T seeds. Throwing black toads is really clever
that's how pape does it all over the place, I stole the idea from the original devs lol
so when I locally gen a seed it zuto runs bizhawk, well that bizhawk window doesnt read any inputs and I can even rebind my controls
it wont even take keyboard input for me
if I open bizhawk normally tho that is fine
its just when archipelago opens it
bombette looks like a lemon candy LUL
with the release of the sora amiibo on friday im prob gonna organize all my amiibo into a tier list on the shelves LUL
with a post it on each shelf for S A B C and Trash
Olimar will def be in trash tier LUL
how do you make an egg missile?
fine until I needed a fortress key that was in rowf 2
mr zebra actually raced too today
iamgine hammering a tree and egg falls on marios face
truer words never spoken by a got
Axl SS and I made some notes finally for BN2 that cater to us lmao
at first I read that I thought, "who is Axl SS?" KEKW props on the notes tho
did the LC ever get added to the board?
Our notes basically just tell you what to do in order, with no direction mostly, so it assumes you know the route lol
hey phantom, do you know what this means? You can have a free WR with delete dive man buster max Cheer100
just make sure you get your bustermax runs in before jugoomba
its weird how you can toggle GBA buster max
only 4 5 and 6 are updated
sorry ice bn2 isnt updated LUL
they need to get those boards up
you submit a run they have to do it
i'll have the full run learned by tuesday
do a bn2 run and submit it bn6. Thats what id do
of a 5-chapter LCL blitz, I still managed to go into a chapter not required thinkning otherwise KEKW
Buit I did finish within 30 minutes of 1st place so thats a goal accomplished
2:44:29 (me who is learning lol)
not the worst for sure, but not nice or easy in the beginning for sure
chapters were 1 3 4 5 7
4 + 6 are my faves to have included
sounds like where I used to live
Uber Eats'ing 2 burritos cuz apparently it's a buy one get one free
lol, Troopa ate shit in front of 3 people
ah, right, you cleared last seed while I was asleep
thought you were going back to Koopa Fort for some reason
I'm waiting on my dinner to arrive
Ah yes, storing the turtle in the cupboard
wait when did THIS update drop
showing how many checks you have done
its been a hot min since i picked up rando lmao
i should try rando at some point
i like it but i get anxiety and tell myself i suck so i never want to try it lmao
but idk any glitches except merlon skip phanto274Smile
and glitchless rando sounds like a difficult time
This is why we throw Yobbi in the volcanos
This be looking like a real thumper.
Tracker says you have another letter
"And suddenly the seed got thrown in the trash"
God that sounds like my OoS rando yesterday
Willard sent me a version of the rando that lets me start with sword
So I'm gonna probably use that one from now on
I can send it to you
Yeah but think of the BM you did to tutenkoopa
Idk blasting tutenkoopa in the face with 3 egg bombs is worth the time loss
one last middle finger from this seed
I only have 8 friends :(
I can't even share with 10
Darn must of just missed it GJ on clearing the randos. ur streaming schedule is sweet.
Drank too much last night, now I'm laying in bed chillin lmfao
It was a good time, im not sick just super tired
is this game just to get in the mode of manipping for kirby hundo PAUSERS
yeah just do that but for like an hour straight
yo I come in clutch for you always pal
But he's playing pikmin and I wanna watch pokemon
They put pickles on my burger frick
Oh I did bully ohrocks last night I guess
It's all alone with white digimon
Makuhita would be a good plush he's just a punching bag
oh yeah how did I forget him
do you believe in magic phanto274GL
you get my actual dollars now
then you'd get more of my dollars woa
phantom you should use this ffurret I bet he's really strong
ah yes, Ekans signature attack... high jump kick phanto274Eyeroll
im doing a 6 badge on norman on my DS without opening the tracker lol
Darn the reset came hunting for u
running starter crawdaunt with speed boost and caught an early on flash fire herracross
next time can I give bits and have brian count for you?
I do trolly stuff like that in another stream all the time, they have brian speak for 300 channel points so we kinda go wild with it LUL
sounds like bn4 all over again
gl phantom VoHiYo this run seems stupid brutal
Gone for 15 come back and it's right where I left phanto274ColonD
would you try grand colosseum as a one off thing?
for the 3 legendaries you can swap them with the birds or regis which you could make a discord poll out of that
nothign a wuick claw wont fix
ran into a trainer who's battle sprite has a baby and see sends out a rayquaza, now im imagining the baby crying its head off LU
Mega Rayquaza is so broken it became a smash boss.
Duking is literally the meme with the super muscley guy typing behind the computer
oh just realized I caught a grovyle early on so dont need to worry about the dumb grass check
made it my HM slave so itll be in the party
i hate this, magma emblem on route 119 without fly
@Axl_SR are you playing Emerald or a romhack or something?
wanted to try 6 badges on norman but didnt feel like streaming so playing on DS
also started a vanilla ruby playthru and the trainer layouts are very different
Yo, have fun with venus KEKW
Oh wait the suicune should target espy anyways
Crawdaunt will make use of mystic water tho
As if cast form wasn't already fucking terrible, V2 coming right up with truant
Well now you have 3 queued up KEKW
Ah OK cool, I lost count
iirc it fucks up a bit but not like, major
I love the music in this game
Do you have any plans to do Gale of darkness?
it's okay when it's dead it can't outspeed EZ
glad I rememberr before I got there, I cant do magma base without strength lol
cool speedrun list! How do you have the patience? I could never speedrun a game without worrying about how many mistakes I'd make
nevermind i do have it, just not the heat badge
Last speedrun I did was resident evil village. And that was before any notable skips were found lmao
ooh did you save the speedrun on twitch?
You gonna make it back with the new knowledge
sees sheer cold *screams YOU NEED TO DIE!*
I'll never get over Numel's damaged animation
heat badge finally in mt pyre, now to do magma and aqua bases
I don't like Pokemon randos as much for some reason
not gonna lie, childhood Axl raised the plusle to level 54
I couldn't even use a Plusle as a child
USe Protect and bait everything into that slot surely COPIUM
I was gonna say I remember it being fairly late
Eagun is actually Ash and here's why
dive locked behind cut by rustboro, i hate everything cause I have 3 room keys
wait how does anything get locked behind rustboro?
2 checks behind cut trees east of rustboro and 3 checks in petalburg forest
so i did the ship and was like i didnt do stevens letter, then i go back to mr stone and he gives room 1 key phanto274Eyeroll
Did you get a good SpA one?
you ever just stop and ask who comes up with these wack-ass names
Funniest part of the run for sure LUL
Dakim makes a bit of sense, he dacked him in the face
I need to go to slayport before aqua base right?
I kinda wonder if you were able to clip into the jail cell you could get to The Under early
wish i had the SS ticket right now LUL
Your movement options are walk quickly or inch along
The only thing I could think of is manipulating Rui in a spot so she would force you out of bounds or something
Are gender ratios the same? dang that's lucky
dark suicune was my fave team rocket card
glad its owner is my fave queen
fly was in aqwua base... i hate everything
Ah dang the 75% reduction Sadge
what type is Espeon's hidden power?
is they’re any area you’re sure you can make up for lost time? phanto274Bless
We gotta claw our way back
wow... room 1 had TM41 Transform LUL
Wait. Do you not have to fight the ludicolo squad?
Oh shit. Shows how long it's been since I've played this game LUL
ok gonna go real quick gotta shut down to clean keyboard and hands.
He reminds me of the Goron from ocarina of time
Yeah just play the song and he won't wanna fight anymore
Slapped in the booty with ads brb
yeah it would be Venus huh
I finally found rain badge giving go mode, was in pacilog currents fuck that
well im not using any maps or anything lol
Venus mailed us a good one.
That horn sounds like it'd play over the speaker at Portillo's
yo he gained the power of knowledge and is gonna destroy this speed run phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam
probably gonna be lurking soon persona 3 is just too good
so been playing more of ruby today
you get no phone calls and that is amazing
yeah, I walked out and thought "why didnt mr stone call me?"
I do know they do plan to add berry checks to the pool
free time save for next run Kappa
when that door opened it just showed outside like its literally just a door frame LUL
here is something funny, when you fight jumpluff look at its shadow
yesterday I was listening to a didyouknowgaming vod
do you have a goal in mind for this category?
its weird to see people actively running bn2
it doenst want to come with us
what do u need  them to do
very lost on hoe this gets u a espyon
Yes made it in time. Hope everyone is well. Did u get the snow?
Hopefully run today goes better than yesterday! phanto274GL
That's a pity. The quilava was so good yesterday
why perfect espyon and not perfect umbreon
my fave eevee is the ghost and dragon type on deviantart.
but official canon its glaceon both the shiny and reg
my fave shiny eevee though is leafeon and espeon mutation over blue ringed umbreon.
@darkapplequeen 5 royal, I wanna finish this before going to another one
@SwiftPichu_  i beat 3 reload it fun
I know it is don't worry, no spoilers emerldRiot
me got p5 installing for tomorrow
Weird, but I also was around before Charizard was even in the burning rng
Now you see why I said welcome to reset hell
all these poor umbreons and espyons in the bin
to give extra luck have espeon on ur shoulder
lol, the jingle keeps waking me up
I’m guessing this isn’t going to be a casual run you do after the month is done lol
Couldn’t happen any other way LUL
Surely they’ll figure out an rng manip for Quil Clueless
Yeah that might be a little yikes
this game would be to perfect if that was added
my reaction to any children near me:
hi, so is the battle mode thing you did at the beginning for starter manip?
Pokemon Fun Fact: In pokemon emerald when you do the tag battle with Steven you can selfdestruct to give Metang all the E X P. If Metang gains 2 levels it learns Iron defense and you can pick when move it forgets. Also if you mod the exp gains you can evolve Steven's Metang into Metagross which is the wildest thing ever. Cheer100
ill link the video I saw it in
rigby is doing an emerald rando, so far 5 badges, HM03, mach bike, and go goggles
I'm a fifth of the way to channel point goal
Poor seedot. Stored all that energy to just go soft LUL
come next month im gonna miss this ost
Did you get a good one this run
Flinches should be removed from pokemon outside of fakeout
They have harmed me for my entire life
Child me got double/triple flinched so many times
Pikachu needs to be dealt with
looks like you are making up good time, looking at all the gold splits
at least this time it isn't faster than espeon LUL
Lets dance on the 10 floors
you can really have bad luck with good luck LUL
so basically a magnitude 5 would have been fine I guess
I don't think I have ever watched this speedrun before. How is it?
Yo Phantom GL on the colo kidroc1Bless
It's been a hot min since I've watched/ran colo
Yea I've been a colo mod for that long
I've been around psr since about Nov 2019
Yea frlg was my first run, I want to expand my games it just sucks because manips plus time to run has gone down recently lol
Plus frlg tourney each year takes up some time for me
You plan on doing any of the main series pokemon games other than let's go?
Gonna lurk for now got work in the morning but GL kidroc1Bless kidroc1Lurk
I never understood why they gave you a lvl 13 plusle anyway
At least make it have perfect ivs and some good exclusive attacks. But no it sucks
Okay, I need an explanation for these strats now
@Schmueh tough to explain. but u reset for ur pokemon start.
Well, I am stuck in ad hell
I guess it's faster to lose those battles and go back in and you don't need the exp
Also I didn't know the dna samples are randomly generated
Just do a tas run, easy
but ye, we playing pikmin 4
i'm doing a big ol marathon of the pikmin games, and this one is the last stretch
he's like half the reason play this game
why are you fighting a monkey
Like WHY on earth did they decide to give a TREE SAPLING, NIPPLES?
probably a preferred option to morning wood
Endgame of the mon is here
Other than the fact in a weird way he reminds me of sephiroth
half the trainers feel like their just a pokemon fusion themselves
@Tandris I do think they eat the DNA of their mon no lie
I was tweaking the emerald layout, but like the old one more so I changed everything back to the way it was LUL
Houndoom not living on one? PAUSERS
Hello all you amazing people! I hope you're all having a wonderful night!!!
phanto274GG phanto274GG brugglGold brugglGold tippiEgg tippiEgg popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_SG popesPOGGERS_TK
Ho-Oh just killed a guy POGGERS
u got a marathon or something?
She did say she would do another run if that changes your mind
perfect timing, wrapping up the Kirby 64 video you uploaded
how high are we counting today?
have you looked at red blue rando? there is talk imseeing about it needing money but all I can think of is safari zone
that sound horrible I want it
sounds like jumpless in pape KEKW
i saw that in discord LUL
how's the colo learning been treating ya
quil isnt too bad cause you tend to know early on enough if it's bad but even then fights later on can be rough
never actually did runs of this tho when i learned it, need to get back to it one of these days
so ive started playing platinum casually and I love the bag compared to emerald. Not having medicine and battle items in the main item bag is so freakin good
I am looking forward to when platinum AP happens
since it is being worked on
could just look at the other DS AP uses
i'll run colo whenever i have a gamecube again, and a rt4k to put my carby into :)
going on the internet and telling lies? D:
I heard that people speedrunning this were using a special save file that fixed the IVs of the Espeon and Umbreon, is that what you're doing?
im a dum dum, there are a few DS games in the works so I just assumed at least 1 DS game was done
Ah I wasn't sure, it was this and Mario Sunshine that had that sort of thing considered but I never learned what either actually did
tfw Sephiroth learns he isn't the ultimate life form
the most tragic thing just happened. I tripped over my DS charger, my DS fell and the game flew out. I havent saved since I picked my starter phanto274Cry
Good Espeon with early manip. Sounds good to me
maybe that means its a good quilava phanto274Thonk
I shouldn't of wished it luck :(
Like, I got my problems with this game with how slow it can be but the 54 checks goes on for so long it gets funny
hungover after working through a 24 oz water bottle of vodka this early morning
No, I just need 1 audio cue on the title screen
And then fuck it up and get Elec
I actually heard your metronome lol
Yo phanto274GL  been here for awhile but was afk
Rider Willie? If you say so
nvm that Misty went a majority of the anime w/ midriff showing
every game you play has such good music
what would this theme be called
Colosseum Battle 1 (Normal Battle - Pokémon Colosseum)
miror b is the only theme we need
there's an evil team fight song, and a normal trainer fight song, but this song is used so much it may as well be the normal fight theme
I think with Not Sephiroth they were just trying to be artsy or something
why is Lonely a nature that exists in this kind of game
A: Oh no! Anyway, kick their asses, Wes!
ok i am actually here now what did i miss
NOOO dont beat up the furret
this quilava is 31 everything i assume
come on phantom it's pronounced murr bee not meer bee. oh you meant the friend to all luidicolos carry on :P
okay so I dont use steam, but I got an email saying a game on my wishlist is on sale. So I changed my password. Then when I go to my wishlist its empty. I think steam is just to get me to come back LUL
also the game was something I never heard of
looks like coaster tycoon with online
back from dinner and Yo little caesars gave us a free crazy bread
I will say one cool thing about archipelago is with bn3 you can save, use an unlocker, send your item, then soft reset KEKW
my mom bought 2 and there was 3 in the bag so guessing little caesars fucked up
Spheal is so sad when fainting
Roses are red, Violets are blue. Omae wa mo shindeiru Cheer100
Hello and GL on your run
alerts are broken but hope you like my poem
His xd theme is better tho
I forgot yesterday so reminder to look at jumpluff's shadow
Man fuckin NAruto ran outa there
prob cause its easier to animate, Sonic has ran like that since dreamcast days
Don't forget to equip the exp share on time as well
is catching or killing tyranitar at the end faster?
Do you have to catch AND purify everything?
That sounds annoying. But then again you have all of battle mountain
Shows how little they think of Dakim. Only put him at floor ten 💀
Who Needs An Entei? We Got a Typhlosion Baby!!! x3 DinoDance
R u winning im finaly back
Now just get good dna samples
Or just go for the yolo strat and guess all 3
what am i eating with my spoon
No worries! Gotta spread the Colosseum love wherever possible
but im carrying  IM the espeon
Doing a HC nuzlocke of XG and just lost the bulk of my mons, but overall was really fun all the same thanks :) How were your Espeon and Typhlosion stat rolls?
Modded Colosseum so know how much hidden BS there is with the purification rates hahah
does that mean i come back
Yeah in my Grand Colo nuzlocke the crit rate boost was a godsend
How long have you been speedrunning colo for?
everything is blank except for  jan and feb
Right gonna head off now as stream was 5 hours and I've got a hunger brewing, nice chatting! Best of luck with this run :)
I love how hitmontop got a better defensive profile and is actually good in grand colosseum
Espeon still the OP Special Sweeper he's always been
Hey Phantom, have you ever watched the Steamed Hams skit from The Simpsons?
I gotta link you something you might like later
It's Steamed Hams in the style of Megaman Battle Network
Oh no, I dropped the Lift Key
Oh snap, you're just wrapping up
Personally, Glaceon is my favorite Eeveelution. Same Special Attack, but more defense (at the cost of speed)
And breaks the OR-AS Delta episode since it's mostly against Dragon types
Ein is bad and unfair in these runs? fatpidTHONK
gl for the rest of the run fwiw
Everyone likes this theme but I think the Peon theme is better
Using that Full Heal performs a glitch, doesn't it
oh god I just realized, you RNG manip for a special HP don't you for these runs
fuck i missed nascour's theme 😔
iirc it only went up to 60
Santa Claus? No screw that. This is Dr. Eggman
I hate sand...it's coarse...and rough...and irritating...and it ruins speedruns everywhere
sounds like me with LM just now KEKW
Sent you the BN Steamed Hams in Discord DM
Modest being bad is so weird why is it like that LOL
Espeon was just pissed their umbreon friend got replaced and had to kill it
writing this long message to see if it gets added to markov
how do i redeem a game to learn?
im curious if this is fun
is this on pop tracker too?
yeah. not a fan if colloseum so im glad for a bit of variation
No way u do classic randoes!
i remember why I hate bn2 LUL
+12 minutes im not doing freeze KEKW
what are the settings listed on your tracker?
oh boy, time to strength some trucks, gl hf!
imagine if text speed on the right is the slowest LUL
man FUCK john what a dick
btw, I found my DS action replay so now I have all the event items on platinum like azure flute, member card, secret key, and oaks letter
i forget that moves like it and wrap are actually broken this gen
Had to go AFK for a bit. What have I missed?
Also how does this work? First time to one of the Pokemon streams lol
is it just get 8 badges to get to pokemon league
I presume roadblocks don't exist then?
i forgot gen 1 only had 5 HMs
No Police in Cerulean, Tea guards, etc
did gen 1 have rock smash?
fly was the one I forgot
I always found it pointless how cut and rocksmash serve the same purpose
Viridian Forest? More like Cerulean Forest amirite?
cant wait to see you hold B on the bike KEKW
legendary, majestic bird pokemon, goes around just pecking at grass dwellers for funsies
So yeah, Moltres is great for now lol
yo running shoes in red phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Jam phanto274BLANKIES
unironically master ball is pretty cheap
why is every Pokémon level 5
when you said "gen 1 sleep is cancerous" I swear I heard that in Ouro's voice LUL
why do you wanna learn boring64?
Pretty sure that was 1HP left lol
he was at one hp lol
refreshing my wifi box be back later.
At least this is some good EXP
Wait what? You can run from Fire Spin but not attack?
That's the complete opposite from how it works now
so somthing I learned today, in the gen 4 games the dark caves are actually lit. They just place a black texture over camera's field of view.
This early that's an almost guaranteed OHKO
we can sweep the next 50 trainers easy
why does dratini have rudolf's nose?
so thats good in early game
save that candy for when dragonair gets to level 54
yooooo we can sweep with everyone
What's he supposed to have? Double Hit doesn't exist yet
fact was so fun I’m already tying the noose just thinking about it
are rare candis a bonus in this or detriment?
@gyroguy123 The struggles of Gen 1
kanapeWave Whats the good word (and yes Itemfinder is 🗑️ )
Didn't you use your Dragon Rage TM?
the best thing in this game yes
I forgot how cute Dratini was in Gen 1
dratini is so huggable the worminess of glory
Dratini is always cute liquiid it’s dratini
It's almost like a modern game!
1000 for bubble and 1500 for poison powder?
I thought trainers didn't fight after the gym leader is beaten
65 bucks for that fight why
Lots of items down here isn't there?
that golbat is funny as heck!
Gold duck is the troll of the seed
once dratini gets thunderbolt we should be good on Golduck
Still gonna die on the way sadly lol
Mm yes, that Carbos is called Swift
According to Bulbapedia... Though its power is listed as 130, the target's Defense will be halved during damage calculation (unless it is at a value of 1), effectively doubling the power to 260.
In Gen 2 it was 200 base
The Defense drop didn't stop until Gen 5
Explosion was 170 in Gen 1, and 250 in Gen 2. Everything else is the same
ok unmuted and ready to go
why would a water be enough to get past boarders
is this a new type of speed run for you?
dratini evolves at 30 right ?
sand slash is so leaned in
I mean you can run back to the pc now since the boat doesn’t leave until yo talk to the captain
Clearly the EXP. All was the beginning of the end
please just never use this move
it’s 90 accurate in this Gen
was fun until i kept dying to bowser and said fuck it 🤷‍♂️
oh i can! i just haven't checked discy today LUL
yeah haven't done a ton of the blitz settings so wasn't ready for it lol
Aight I'm gonna go grab something to eat. Try not to break the game while I'm gone
don’t think he’ll have choice in that gyro
double slap hit more than twice thats not double then is it
any of you ever see the toad jumpscare in Mario tennis
you see, he gave you the HP Up because fishing is a way of life
electabuzz looks so normal compared to everything else
iirc there's only 2-3 required ones left
Isn't there a choice between two unavoidable battles in the maze?
so I just caught rotom, I got it to 2HP and paralyzed and got it in a permier ball. It was an easy catch for a catch rate of 45
see I told you we’d get ice beam just believe
everytime i see some pokemon i have that mental not of phils noises.
it can't just be that you accidently hit them, every single one has to have 4-5 pokes
Alright I'm back. Did you break the game?
i forgot eggecute looked like that
fishing is a way of life, so as fishermen they give you hp up so you have more life to fish
That would be Pokedex if he wouldn't give you a random item in return!
calling oak has the master ball
I feel like that's the equilivent of what you'd get if the safari zone secret house was real
golem looks like a dwende in this game
Damn, Neo Team Rocket would've made a fortune off its tail
oh damn they finally got it
If Oak doesn't have anything are you softlocked?
so is it a hidden item under ground
You beat Giovanni in Celadon, so I don't see why not
are the coins in the casino random items
Hidden Items aren't in the pool
yooo vaporeon was for pretty decent deal
And you need to have Surf for Power Plant, right?
I think if you open the Pokemon menu, the map lights up for a few frames
Ok so, you got every item in Safari Zone, cleared SS Anne... Mt Moon...
Eevee check at the top of the building in Celadon is a random mon, right?
Are vending machines randomized? Do those even exist in this game?
Hii Phantom phanto274Smile how are you tonight?
Did you get the item north of Nugget Bridge?
So you shouldn't be anywhere near here right now
that item is very out of logic
Did you get the potion from the mart guy on route 1?
So you have to go back to Oak 3 times
i forgot that was a think
He gives you the Dex after Route 1 stop
5 Pokeballs after parcel, and then another 5 after rival
You didn't talk to him at the start, so you got the Pokedex check as well as the parcel check
I might have been reading the item list wrong.
I dunno where that third item came from
I'm on the Bulbapedia page for Oak's lab, and only two items are listed under RBY. I didn't notice that and assumed they were all for RBY, FRLG, HGSS
Lets Go Pikachu and Eevee has 7
Yeah, most of the Lets Go checks are the stones
Rock Climb after all 16 badges
And Jade Orb from Groudon and Kyogre from Embedded Tower
Aight, Imma be quiet now, cause I feel like I've been spamming a lot. Want to give other people a chance to chat lol
Too bad it wasn't Fly though lol
Also you're welcome for the clarifying. I like helping
Understated how much of a dickhead Blue is / was that he infiltrated a Rocket occupied building JUST to fuck with you
Blue nor Red helped u out against giovonni even regarding the fact its there kin family member.
Compared to moving spinners, anything is better lol
whomever decided trainers move / react to walking & running, I hope they got the help they needed
G1 Seel was SUPER derpy, holy moly
Ah, there's 3 hidden items in Seafoam
I miss that Golbat sprite so much
What's the "john" for this loss, John?
also Machamp is just a playground bully. "Where's my 5 bucks, bud?"
and then the electric type joins
"I lost my Master Ball, but this is good enough, right?"
like a mother getting Gario Bros at the store instead of Mario
You don't have a PokeDoll for Copycat
damn, Red Nurse Joy is kinda underrated, imo
Marowak took the doll with it to the afterlife
It knows what you pick and then chooses a move accordingly
legit forgot Tangela was a Grass type
also trainers dont use pp in red/blue. They can use moves infinitely
if sleep's not bad enough for ya, freezing mf'ers is always an option
me begging my mon to wake tf as they're getting their ass beat
I think FRZ is 10% chance to break out per turn?
or get hit by a fire attack
I thought that wasn't until G2
I think USING a fire attack breaks FRZ in gen 2
damn, these questions ARE made for Twitter
oh, actually gen1 freeze is naturally unbreakable. Ice heal, hit by fire type move that inflicts burn, or if the opponent uses Haze.
I've been wondering that myself for the longest
that 70% feels too much like a coin flip at the worst of times
also apparently in gen1 there was a way to get 63 PP on a move by being frozen
RGBY were held together with hopes, dreams and whatever office supplies they had handy
damn, that's one crazy ass rope
JR-TRAINER are just boy / girl scouts, change my mind
who's this random ass just chilling near an abandoned power plant
Wait, they can switch out in this gen???
May or may not be the last sub/t2 for a while, finally splurged and got turbo
Also no Fly is unfortunate but could be worse
Better than Emerald currents without Fly...
I was about to make fun of John for not being friendly to Golbat. Forgot Crobat doesn't exist in this game
HahaSweat  that metapod almost got you
popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_HF stupid143GG stupid143GG phanto274GG phanto274GG tippiEgg tippiEgg popesPOGGERS_SG popesPOGGERS_TK PogChamp minimi6Pog
I signed up for an async testing upcoming R/B entrance rando changes
ok my fave on the planet shall start
hope you have a good rando
are they characters besides Mario you can play in Rando?
I feel like shit a bit. I felt like more shit earlier. I ate too much today LMAO
oh I wanted to ask. While I was ohheyi30Lurk I noticed that the guard at the elite four asked for how much stuff you got. Could you ask for all 150/151 or no?
or set it up that way I mean
in that case, the alternate version's pokes will be in your game?
and trading pokes would be evolved another way?
100% the pokedex, in a RANDO ? ? ?
In-n-out could never have chili cheese fries
I would think maybe because it's bullshit, but I could be wrong PrideLaugh
I won the race over Lopez!
ignore the fact that he died to Bowser and DNFed
but I PBed by 7 and a half minutes so it was pretty good
well shit, that's a dub pb
So Sword on 10 Shells, yeah?
I've been itching to do a PMR again, but I need to read all of the new updates PrideLaugh
Oh, is only 20 enabled in this setting?
yeah this was my first run with all clean fights so I can definitely save the last minute and a half
@OhHeyItJaye it's so nice with the new minimal cutscenes
I bet. I haven't played since like, the end of season 0?
I also did seed#1 of the asyncs and was quite rusty LUL
oh no you said the word, now the seed will be terrible KEKW
whod you feel about red/blue rando?
Put some habanero Heinz ketchup and it wasn't terrible
Been sick all week, your vods have been such a blessing phanto274Bless
That is by design, you can switch tunic between your options at a phone booth. If you have an tunic color override, you can see your current tunic in the [SELECT] menu inside your inventory screen.
the hookshot glitch is in logic
is the a logic check to see what is flagging it
that the only way to get it right now i am pretty sure
If you go to the left side
The tracker must think you're on that logic
You'd have to show me that
Down the stairs, and go over the orange tiles
You can super jump on top
Knowing that super jump for d7 makes it so much faster
If you look inside the seashell it just says "lmao idiot"
is this a check you can only peak?
You teleported to his hands lol
I tried doing bomb triggers, and it wouldn't let me
If you fire 2 bomb arrows at him, he dies
so jelly right now, Japanese Mcds gets kirby toys
I mean it's called Key cavern
It's the OST for this dungeon LUL
You can go back to d8!
Funny enough there's 1 extra key in this dungeon
A cock in the water level
its 2am here and i have to stay up for 1 more hour Sadge
and i am not a sub Sadge
interesting, I have black bars on the sides cause watching on a wide monitor and the emotes that drop from being first also spill over the black bars
well its in the vod if you wanna see it
I started emerald but got tired and hungry, shame too cause Peeko gave me fly
Give us this day our daily pape
it went to mauville, which was dope cause i had no badges yet
And lead us not into TTYD
did you peak the spoiler log for it?
interesting, it doesnt show the rain emotes in the vod
what is sushi’s purpose in this seed phanto274Thonk
playing platinum im using a team ive never used before. Vaporeon, Scizor, Gliscor, Houndoom, and Rotom Mower. Still need to decide on the last one.
badges are all pretty cheap at least
no ch 5 means ultra hammer could be in haven shop LUL
some nice checks in the desert
so what is this about today?
@Mirby_Studios could u do a co op with phantom or would u make a bad team mate?
@Mirby_Studios like on a pape or pokemon rando.
i've only beaten the game like once lmao
popesHmm priidiHmm minimi6Hmm popesHmm_HF that does prove diffulty.
i'm mostly just confused why you asked right when i entered lol
I kinda wanna see dif content and how he would navigate it.
Mario looks like building mario with that pallet
why do the stairs in his house have the ability to retract like it’s his attic
but the fireplace is up there
who can blame you with these key designs
sushi finally got a use after a whole 80 minutes
it’s something for her to do
predicting power bounce in peach’s castle
i'll have to get used to it lol
Luigi can take his mansion and shove it <redacted>
and armory and weston boos can also <double redacted>
armory went to the right side room after going into the hallway instead of back into armory, cellar boo got away at 8 health, weston boo went to pipe room twice. a tale as old as time
it could have been, cellar through weston was my last chance to save enough time. an earlier run died to a 4 cycle boolossus
that earlier run was like 30 ahead out of area 2
ok dinner time be back later if ur on
Just in time for the end
But what if I'm a switch
yea, this looks like seed 7
Which led to my eventual demise
but I'm gonna try the seed again tomorrow
I was only half paying attention to the seed so....
I'm still getting used to playing on console, there are a few small differences
back from dinner and oh we are on a second
I’ve had a on/off fever all day and it gets high and it hurts
yeah stream is a major distraction im ngl
hey, how did u get blue mario?
how'd you manage to get that?
i come back from afk and see ramen
you need to know what u doing then lol
i'm waiting for the release of paper mario thousand yr door on switch
they say 2024, but idk till when
i haveto imagine we're getting a direct soon
how long u been playing paper mario for?
how come u don't block sometimes?
how come u trying to be at 1 hp?
mega rush gives massive damage for being in peril
so as long as you can mitigate dying via blocking and other mitigation then you just trounce bosses
I'm about 90% confident Phantom is playing this seed exactly as I did
I actually forget where this is
i got a key though a wall (but in the switch version) does the glitch that lets you clip inside work?
ohh i think i know unless u did it already
you just checked the first 3 items on the storefront i think
i was thinking you didn't go back to anti guy
at least i got to see my fave cloudy guy
after beating 7 i think you just walked past rolf after talking about it
I’ve barely had danger Mario recently
OMG rare rage bonus content. Lets kill it
But some of those final fights are brutal
could we have a way to guarantee life shrooms in a shop?
you could most likely code a way to make that a thing but that up to the devs
Just trying to think how to reduce the spike from four chapters to final
think this seed want u too win
Fumes def been settling in now
genesis melee is getting spicy catArrive
are Bombette and kooper the only partners that can’t hit flying enemies?
does anti guy have a powerbounce cap? like bosses
Back at it again with the randos. How's the seed?
im trying to fight him for the first time (got him to 9 hp (if i got a lucky i would of won (30 bp, 10 fp and hp + 1 fp and hp badge)
no, i want fight him now without watt
@scrambleddragons asynchronous means not at the same time
It's one of those slow start seeds
marcoRNG marcoRNG_HF all of it we can get
okay I feel slightly more human
phanto274Lurk how has this seed been
Bombette was there for moral support
only partner you need for moral support honestly, all the others are fake af
maybe bow too i guess, but i'm never confiding in goombario for sure
Dang we are lucky. What is this? Three seeds in one night
are the sewers hidden blocks, in the area with the upgrade block not their untill later (im in toy chapter)
I keep forgetting this is the day you go for longer to do all seeds
I can't believe Jr became a goth girl Sadge
You could of just triple shooting star then watt charged him
I've been ohheyi30Lurk so I saw you did 3 randos PrideLaugh
think its Bedge time or do i play more persona 3 hmm
but the game is almost over ice
Mario Story - Bowser, My Old Enemy!
Do you have the twitch income listed on the taxes or are you below $600 on here
how many fails before the secret prepared gamecube memory card with the juicer espeon.
what pokemon was that bottom middle
Amish are you out there smoking big doinks in Amish?
I saw this last time and u got annoyed
Started the game with a firered/leafgreen team
bottom middle of that skarmory one
so this is ovieously rng manip, after that your espeon will be basically perfect?
Espeon won't be perfect, just usable
waiting for a perfect one can take quite a while
maybe you get a Typlosion that is faster than espeon again
Cool to see what the too looks like too
an incredible espeon means you will get a bad quilava
Why did he bring the umbreon if he's the one using thief
on how many fps does this game run?
that is fricking hard to get
I thought with 30fps it would be reasonable, but that is hilarious LUL
why did u start timer before u said yes
[-and then 20 seconds off wr  would SUCK
image a 10 second wait then then being like 10 seconds off wr   would be a ass
i think  in grand colosseum they give all shadow mons perfect ivs
and you might be able to change your nature? but I am not sure
think about it tho   hospital and all my probbys
the epic 2 second battle is blocked by math phanto274Cry phanto274Cry phanto274Cry
we aren’t watching the game btw phanto274Smile
u should do a run with worst possible one
HOW did people even figure this stuff out
one of life’s great mysteries darkapple
yes 👏 ur on see ya 👋 in a bit.
monadoShy monadoS  pls no more counting high
also it amuses me that the Run command is "Give in". "GIVE IN TO THE COWARDICE"
monadoS  im allready lost with counting
if you were to battle, does that increase the RNG by a known amount?
Hey there Phantom. Good luck on the runs./
aw man Charizard deserved to be lvl 100
i didn't know it been a hour
it was only a matter of time
it should always just read "Mom" for that one viewer, a la MySpace
I think my internet just died LUL
so you got a good espeon finally
No I got a NotLikeThis it was phantom
But it got the blue NotLikeThis
I'm debating what game to do for the multiworld
WW will be too fast and I'll get hard stuck instantly but idk if I wanna play vanilla terraria lol
well the stream cut out for me but hooray for a runnable mon?
do you do the badges out of order in platinum, the fen badge is 3rd but you dont get surf til after 5 badges in
yes, because telling people through your stream to refresh will ensure that they hear it :P
@chat if you panicBasket 'd the stream, refresh
the ghost gym was my 3rd one
Fantina is gym 3 in Platinum and 5 in DP
yeah looking a diamond speedrun they do fantina 5th
and platinum speedrun does it 3rd
okay so in DP her pokes are mid 30s and Plat they are mid 20s
still weird that it locks the surf which is way later, once you meet cythia's grandmother
oh man it's been years since I watched someone play Xenosaga. I don't really remember
college roommate played all of them right in the living room. Was probably too busy playing WoW, myself.
my first PS was PS3, so I never experienced them
maybe they will be remade at some point for Nintendo consoles? idk
but I am happy we got the Xenoblade series
the gd-flu hit me a month later
and god damn does it hurt
Ah no feel better soon Lai
today is the first ive felt human but its 100% the iv fluids making me feel like a person again
this is such a based game
i dont think ive ever 100% completed it tho, i got stuck and just gave up looool
Qui Be Nice To Us :c
2b in granblue has an alt costume for how she looks after self destructing
So ass out for all to see
ok all set so we got unlucky how?
so what's the worst case scenario?
so might need to take more steps?
okay so maybe i didnt suck at this game when i palyed it, i wonder if i got fucked over by rng
Death by Tippi, unironically a classic
I am using the kirby keyboard/mouse pad thing
Don't blame you, this run rng tests your patience a lot
Yeah past that fucking furret it's somewhat safe until the under
And after venus it's control+ F and search the fucking combination nascour uses
If you did hit a runable now you're one lucky bastard
I am not a speed runner, but all this rng stuff would keep me away from running this ever Kappa
@Schmueh rng can be addictive at times
Yeah, but I would get far too frustrated
Oh, great song from a great game
This reminds me, I still wanted to play the ttyd version of this game
I started, but honestly I am not amazing at this game and still went with hard
Honestly I remember watching you playing Minish Cap the first time I came here for some reason
I spent a week of my life replaying Persona 3
hands were busy but wow it’s been a year since Minish cap already Oldge
In other news I'm trying to eat this pack of siracha yakisoba noodles I bought but the spice is so weak that I've resorted to trying to spice it up
Oh yeah I guess buff00n is offering to drag me out to Midwest Speedfest so I'll be looking forward to that
I remember watching your run on the Japanese restream
Nothing wrong with playing the all time favs casually once in a while
I can literally play Cave Story at anytime in one sitting if you asked me to
I wanna stream the CS Rando
Haven't gotten around to setting up stuff for it
I am probably going to try for April, didn’t clue in I’d be away when this one starts lmao
how many games are supported these days
saw someone do a starcraft randomizer the other day... .was crazy lol
DK64 is also being worked on I think
i'd imagine it also has to do with minish cap's popularity
I will be heading to bed for tonight
Who were those toads you had to chase away Hmm
the multi-world thing is where you find something and it sends to someone else's game (potentially) right?
I'd like to learn Emerald but i'd say I have the most experience in pkmn crystal
its cool seeing the JP text
double dual income no kids huh
Black Ninja Koopa can't even have his bloody smoke break in peace
Looking at Archipelago and the only DKC game supported is 3 this is such a win for me specifically
Terraria is supported also a win for me
i learned what i already knew, that i need to practice area 3 and 4. because i again was green out of area 2, then boolossus and armory and weston
KEKW yea maybe i should use this knowledge of what i'm consistently bad at to practice effectively
casual rigby bop would be funny
yeah this is mostly just reading the fights
Just got here and an ad ia gonna start
even after just 2-3 runs the past few weeks my muscle memory has basically taken over for movement and the actual route, just fights are the issue now
forgot the start sprits also appeared in mario party 5
lopez is the only one right now at a high level
i used to watch this run back before we really had the neat any% tricks
i'm like 40% here for the music ;)
i put it for 10 mins maybe i should of put 30 mins
come on kids, gamba is good for you
if you go over 3:53, someone's getting paid OUT
yo raven ty for the gl
yo tiger ty for the gl
yo lopez ty for the gl
fine i will enter the fray
Yo lopez ty for the gl
C'mon Phantom, time to hustle that sub 3:53 and make me some pts ;)
I just had the weirded game crash ever doing emerald rando off line and I hadnt saved in over an hour
felt random, I was local recording so I can share it laterr
"Mario hates mushrooms. No, really." Peach (Movie)
Was gonna try different routing doing weather institute before meteor falls and the crash put me back to petalburg woods fight
I was excited too cause I fished a charmander with earthquake, drill peck, hyper beam, and poison tail phanto274Rage
I have a 69 ranked winstreak in kof rn
someone keeps trying to facetime me
lets start a call so i can bridge them and you can answer it on stream lol
:) I'm sure it's legal in most states
I am now at a 70 win streak Sadge
I could easily cause of ps4 lol
Hey man you came up with something
I mean as in colo being a dumbass
I cant be silent anymore but doin a rockin job so far. Me number is now shown.
that's ok, you'll get sub 3:53
well gamba wouldn't be fun if it were a sure thing
why is the Japanese version of a game speed run always faster
im gonna have to learn the berry locations. Im not expecting the tracker to be updated with those lol
plus im not marking the map tracker anyways, trying to get away from that
still would be nice to see map light up when its in logic
2 hrs reached oh forgot its a run. awsm
weird that emote didnt show on chat box
This is some strange looking pokemon lol what happened with that?
Sadge 2 hours?! Yikes I don't blame you playing something else then
not losing time a very good thing
Oh wow it's been a hot minute since I've heard this song lol
imagine a just chatting stream with 100% ads
lol. i bet they could do it
more likely the 100% ad stream would be of one of those hottub/sunbather streams
Lol him being dead but alive enough previously to accept mail 🤣
discord the only thing that ping me
twitch is really annoying with all of the ways it pings me lol
feel like i have to turn off a lot of the settings every month
love the aesthetic of this place
I can't 100 these fights yet like I can the others
I recently came across a fun question. "If you could make a PowerPoint presentation about any one topic, what would you pick?"
a powerpoint on why we don't like quizno subs
it is cool spinning movement reminds me of deku
ello phantom how's the run going?
phanto274GG phanto274GG popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS popesPOGGERS marcoWin marcoWin tippiWin tippiWin marcoWin_HF marcoWin_HF a10cjWine a10cjWine
I hardly bet much I only put 10k I just wanted buff00n to lose his points
someone just paid for they vip LMAO
Didn't realize Raven was waging war in chat while they're playing lethal company
we got a q2 titan the run is good
@NSingman I never broke the bank so much. new family member.
@NSingman how many points did you get
i got my wager back by watching
Still beats my PB by a lot
this run only cost me 100K
Thanks for VIP @buff00n and Lopez
I had to spend 17k of my own hard earned points thank you very much
@blacktiger51 I'm eating taco bell rn
did you see my weird crash?
so what’s the stitch and menu?
OG gameboy chime threw me off
man 🧍‍♂️ do I feel like 👍 a million 💵
Yo chat, which is the best type of apple?
We're also talking about apples on their own so we can keep it fair
I wanna try a few more seeds first
also you could dnf if something come up
there are very few games on the list ive actually played
i wouldnt know how to set that stuff up and im lazy KEKW
1 day pape rando will be added COPIUM
Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Gala, and Honeycrisp
not gonna lie, when I was a kid I went to blockbuster and I had a choice between Mario RPG and Mario is Missing and I was so put off by the box art I went with Mario is Missing LUL
And to this day ive never played it KEKW
I think I rented Mario is missing once. I only remember being confused as heck as to what to do.
If someone voted for red delicious I'd have to kill them
i don't think i ever seen gameplay
ok 👌 poll is done ✅ lean green
Golden delicious and honeycrisp the only other ones with votes
but since it was an option honeycrisp way to go
why's Red Delicious called that when it's the opposite of delicious
but like u said apple cider 🍺 didn’t count
Yeah, we're counting apples on their own
No caramel or special coatings, not on the side of a meal, just on their own
I usually go for Gala or Honeycrisp
They sell the best by FAR
at one point, my gran bought nothing but Granny Smith, so I got a wee bit sick of 'em
Rave are just better and on sale when they're available
we like never dont have a sale going on for rave when we have them in season lol
I'll have to keep an eye out for Rave
This furret is really strong you should use him
Raven apples look like they came out of a cartoon
mod raven 🐦‍⬛ now an apple 🍎
let the run really rev up
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more.” Okay Phantom, I want to see how cultured you actually are. Who wrote this poem titled "The RavenFP"? Cheer100
People dont watch for pedestrians istg
Some jackass ran a red light at top speed and was a foot away from hitting me
so hype that you run this game! gl and hope you are well phanto274Bless
shows how little i know of the route
shadow Remoraid would just shoot 9mm at you from its mouth
gj taking out that deadly threat
The Pokemon Company was DESPERATE to make the Mantine and Remoraid connection stick
now we just pull out the safety memory card
what pokemon is that bottom middle
uh oh speedrun com moderators aren't going to like this submission
they're gonna kill you on the spot for the timer
it’s like a requirement for that to happen once every stream
This song makes me lose control ratJAMMIN
I see words on stream right now OpieOP
Phantom strim has a lot more jam emotes added
YOOOO i havent seen this game in forever
dont waste the nostalgia on a speedrun stream, go download the difficulty hack and play it yourself
oof sounds like a tough speedrun
the hgss rng manips are way worse you have to move your character the right way the whole run
Earthbound RNG manips like that too
damn alot goes into this huh
speedrun com mods wouldn't like that video of your cheating program
its only cheating if it defined so in the rules LUL
oh yeah they check a local vod?
Jugoomba asked in teambn and no one opposed
What's this trainer's class and name?
like whos gonna run bn4 anyways KEKW
Umbreon looks so hurt every time it takes damage
just realized that Wes never said if he did / didn't care about those goons kidnapping someone
If you start speedrunning Pokemon Colosseum you're admitting that you're in need of mental health help.
My area is more like a swamp
I've seem downfalls tagged as this on twitch
The further west you go the more it looks like this
I got 1 and a half mins of ads i aint hearing any of this
twitch has to tell me about the FRESH DOG FOOD FROM THE FARMER'S DOG
Does your dog get chicken pot pie filling from a plastic bag in the fridge phantom?
Twitch thinks I want to do that
my cat eats our dog's food
my cat will take whatever attention
said cat also won't hesitate to hop on top pf you
The feral cats outside will eat anything even straight up carbs it's wild.
Bro who gave miror b the bilinear filtering cut
bro ur makuhita just tried to attack a man
Shadow Lugia luckily spared everyone in the ship just to float in the ocean
makuhita was just off some stuff
if you didn't notice, the great ball was just duped
wdym he's ???? didn't you READ
DUKING looks like someone that drinks ROGUE ENERGY
is it bad i got a lg baja blast with my dinner?
That's a lot of sugar tiger. Make sure it's only an occasional treat
I believe ROGUE ENERGY might have sugar free flavors tho
you got any of them free shipping codes for the sample packs too or am I too late for that
i forgot how good baja blast is haven't had it for a long time
me gonna come watch in a min gonna lurk for now
bro when miror b said to carry a gun they didn't mean to carry a remoraid
he only got two arms tho
I guess that's still more than average Kappa
holy cow my stream delay is a lot, let me refresh
fave portion of the run time
entei went from sent out to dead
So what is the purpose of this part
plusle doin its job of wiping?
The cipher lab is so hype in XD
you get like 5 shadow pokemon
you picked up a WHAT from the computer lab?????
Cipher does WHAT? And you're taking SAMPLES?
that vigoroth is doin a pogChamp
you picked up a dna sample....
You caught croconaw having a shower?
or having some fun on the computers?
Amphorous is the perfect mix his Mega is a dragon.
yo phantom how goes the colo?
Shadow vibrava was an odd choice
genius sonority was based for it tho
getting crit by yourself for blaze blows
bro that dude is still using an uber
is that the dude from final fantasy 7
this is gonna be so rough.
what's gonna be the march run then
bro is about to speedrun i wanna be the boshy on stream
The sound for the UFO is the same sound for a shadow pokemon
Does monado just gift sub to everyone that enters chat
Sudowoodo has a nice shiny sprite
you already said this cant pb
pacer pals just unsubscribe, unfollower, cancel the rogue energy sour candy purchase....
can we get a micro review of the sour candy flavor
What does that "Tiger's blood" one taste like
Tigers blood used to be my flavor for snow cones
The Queen always makes me nervous
You hate venus but how you you feel about the pre-mixed rogue energy in cans?
there are exclusive flavors looks like
looking into jugoombas manips but cant get it so trying to make my own
ill be happy with just 2 lol
I have a vod I saved of him only chaining 3, but now he does 5
not even important enough to use boss music
Shadow tropius was a wild choice
why no banana flavored rogue energy huh
I woke up, watched the partner direct, saw Epic Mickey, turned it off, saw Mother 3 and didn't care
Epic Mickey all I needed to know
I have the epic Mickey game on wii 🤣
So whens the next pit run? Madge it's been a while
Sadge but I feel like watching pit runs
Curious as to what next months run is
Will it be a zelda game?
Nice ur doing a revenge runback
I think it's gonna be BN5 LUL
My sora amiibo arrived, everyone is here and on my shelf lol
its gonna be awhile to get used to but being filthy rich feels nice.
that comment by pallos was fine.
real tlak if I was that guy and someone took my pokemon I wouldn't send out another pokemon I'd pull out a gun
oh no come on guts this out
With having such a good quil tho you should save time in the long run right?
Ah ok so you'll need to get it to flame wheel asap then?
How do you know it's IVs?
It's going to be a beast later on tho
i think mirez here skipped leg day
dude has like a 12 pack somehow
Would you try get quil in blaze now?
wait nevermind I see red numbers.
Pacer pals, cancel your order of a rogue energy "waifu cup" shaker
Now that im back from the ad break for the 8k oled TVs can you say that again
let's see how good the plusle is
we all set now. Crisis have been overted.
it can hit itself in confusion into Blaze
With the remaster of epic mickey I went back and watch a game dev interview on the wii release and what a treat that was.
i'm mad that i got monkey paw'd
i've been wanting another rare game on N64 NSO... and we got one! and it was fuckin BLAST CORPS
My sister had it, enjoyed my time but didn't play much of it
Did I just afk a bruh moment
Camera control wii be so nice
epic mickey is based and a reason to install dolphin and rip a real copy of epic mickey you got yourself
the real wii exclusive that needs a port is zack and wiki quest for barbados treasure
All I know about the direct is epic mickey and mother3, I slept in after past night lol
I've had an injected mother 3 on my 3ds for years and showing it to people through streetpass
yeah it's like a Royal or Golden for it, now that i've finally seen seen concrete details
so no transferring save data but you CAN transfer demons from your compendium. 3 of them.
Is that a smt 5 follow up?
so you can get vengenace and play the original storyline (Canon of Creation) or the new route (Canon of Vengeance)
both of which are said to be 80 hours, and you choose which route at the start
Canon of Cringe is a Persona title
you can now also save anywhere and the level cap is now 150
they're also tweaking a few things in the original storyline to touch them up which is nice
oh also they shadowdropped Penny's Big Breakaway so that's nice
That's by the sonic mania devs
How many shadows do you catch?
also of all games to get a switch version, i never expected Pocket Card Jockey lmfao
I had a feeling something gamefreak would be there
My water bottle is gdq branded and says silly stuff like rng pause buffer sub pixel death warp and damage boost LUL
Love getting a add second u respond
i like the way they all padded out the door of time.
monadoLove  we are here to support uuu
Quil got exp earlier than normal due to it purify so if you need to give espeon exp share earlier in Mt then should equal out better
AWW SPHEAL IS SO CUTE IN THIS GAME
I give rng to random crit him
has next months game been announsed yet
is it hello kitty roller rescue phanto274Lurk
yay i have my spooon back
We shall dance to the top Quickly with experience in toe
awww taking my spoon off me
sorry had to go get Yoshi lol
SA2 was good, lost another PB paced run to Bofa skip (not a ligma)
you break bofa da boxes and clip out of bounds LUL
I've been here a while but I ran a kof ft10 so I was unable to type for like an hour
they are really cool at least Hero Story imo
well people who can actually play the game well lmao (not me )
Hero story is like the only run I ever hear people doin
"running" lol I am trying to learn but it's like learning 3 games at once bc of the variety of skills each of the characters use
there's something like 500 different emerald locations (100 ish per level)
ye I did have a short VGC stent LUL
I also caught a straight up wild Charcadet in my violet playthrough with 6 perfect IVs drtoadWiggle
some odds like it's 4 times more likely to win the powerball or some shit
YEP and I wasted my good RNG in a casual pokemon game vs any speedrun ever LUL
granted I believe I still have the only recorded 10 cap (no dodgemaster) hallway boweser fight lmao
human machamp we meet again. Give us all ur power we need it!
Woah what I miss?! Somethings gone right
I saw the first few fights on Mt battle but then on phone 🥴 glad you stuck it out with this run
I think I like Pyrite just a little better because of the theme but the Under is very cool
It’s tough to beat. rough that the lab comes after this pepeW
Heyo, I know I'm hella late. How goes the run?
I checked. The evolution line is based off the honey badger
Yikes. Mainline games would be harder if that were the case lol
this typhosion be flexin' on them
Cynthia just pops out Spiritomb and Garchomp next time. Fun times
Like the level 29 ludicolo 😬
Has the physical/special split happened in this game? I forget when it came out
Man this place has a lot of battles
Oooo I see a pretty fair run going
All this Typhlosion does is hit fire blasts
The sweat is running on my face now
What was the point of that?
@gyroguy123 that would be pachirisu and emolga along with deddenne deddene is only 1 i like though
How did they screw that up so badly lol
This game feels like an enormous test of patience lol
Should be easy with that Plusle
At least you don't lose money when you lose, right?
Just haven't been seeing any payout messages, so I just assumed it wasn't happening lol
Flareon has drizzle ans starts with thunder, you can make this shit up lol
reminder that all these animations are STOLEN soul from the stadium games
and it wasnt even a prank bruh
Wait, no Miror B theme? 0/10 fight
looks like i just beat persona 3 remake
1/6? Only a 16.5% chance then
Not healing Typhlosion to keep it in Blaze?
Because AI sees a kill and targets with both mons more often than not
So you just solo the other mon and protect on Typh every other turn?
What type is your Hidden Power?
Oh right I was confusing that with damp
whoa wtf I never knew that
I’ve never beat the end of this game to know the major is a fake homie
this game is killer like that
but I'm pretty sure you can for Evice
nascour you have to face the whole tournament agian
The defense buff wasn't introduced in this gen, right?
Damn... Rough ending cause of Evice
back just for the end of adge
I am just speechless u crawled back.
only thing that would be better is if it had a better purify nature imo
thats about as good as you can get for first split LOL
my reath and ferma is currently at 1:01 i think
red are bad nature green are runnable with the right amount of calls, and pink is to farm on natu
every nature that can happen to
I take bow wow on an adventure everyday, it's called walking other people's dogs for a living
Oh boy! I'm so hungry I can eat a Gordo!
You killed my dog you asshole
Taking Link on an adventure instead
Link's life would be so much easier if he could just eat Ganon
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE HERO OF HYRULE
I would play ToTK if Link behaved like this the whole time
Very interesting sprites you got going on
The sprite of Bow Wow fishing back there was incredible
Link finally understands that he can just slurp half of Ganon's minions
I can’t even keep track of what’s happening in this room
The dog failed to tame the boy
heheheeh u are the bowwow so cute
Wdym?  I think it's normal for link to be in a dungeon
It's normal for link to act like a dog on a leash
you don't leave Hyrule for some... Dream.  And the worst part, he's bringing his courage down with him.
took me a second to realize you're controlling the chain chomp
why is mario chomp on this dragon quest game
which of these two chomps eat the cake faster was the peak mario party minigame
dang, I forgot how disorienting the bowow sprite sheet is when you're not expecting it
are those POKEYS from PAPER MARIO CHAPTER 2?
ok wtf is going on? HUH
is this regular good boy mode or swordless?
good boy mode logic is a bit janky, I think the crystals get removed because he logically counts as a sword
I think daid has said that he can eat cutscenes sometimes
i keep getting mindfucked by the sprite swap
can you add flying items in dungeons to the rando?
if i want to redeem a rando do i need to give you a seed or smth?
Betty Botter bought some butter But she said the butter’s bitter If I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter But a bit of better butter will make my batter better So ‘twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter. Okay Phantom, its your turn now. Cheer100
LADX Rando and maybe Emerald? Just do Archipelago and do both easy
frik i thought seed redeem was 25k… oh well
is the next game called the legend of bow wow?
You should be able to beat it
i wanted you to do a keysanity dungeon full shuffle
i wanted to shuffle the entrances as well
Wait wtf are you bow wow
cool thing dropped last night. Banjo Tooie AP V0.3 Alpha. Tooie is better suited for rando cause all the worlds are connected and some checks need later abilities so its loosely a 3D platformer metroidvania
I was watching a video on its world design and thought "this would make a great rando" and 20 minutes before I joined the channel that release was dropped.
Also icebound was credited for help with it too
Have the seashells ever lead to anything required?
oh I didn't see that one yet.
I did see the animals are in animal village one though. XD
also there is a rando out for it already but its more of a ram hack hack than a rom hack so it wont work on everdrive
i just ch3cked out the clip, very ominous.
I am now following DK64Speedruns on twitch
DK64 is peak gamer mental illness
you've lost the plot once you start playin' that
wait you're playing as the chain chomp?
I thought u were zelda just flopping around helplessly
Phantom "best sprites in the game" 5800
getting too good, time for some decoupled ER
Bow Wow died to save his dog, what a good owner
Didnt know link was into being a pet
shuffled or randomized bosses? can we pray for oops-all-slime-eels?
what rando do you enjoy more between this and minish?
I doubt that many played minish, just feels like a zelda most slept on
that guy was like, "whats a bitrate?" LUL
a container of watermelon ranges from $7 to $14 but a 1/3 of a watermelon sells for $5 and some change
do people hate cutting the rind that much???
1 heart? damn, that's rough buddy
I think skipping the first one is a TAS trick, yeah
doing pretty good, just got home from work phanto274Smile  how are you?
guessing you adding banned stuff to this now
at long last my pent up energy from the race is expelled. now to enjoy a rando
need the health and thx 4 warning
never seen a rando for this game nice
which dungeons do you have left
can do like 2 dungeons now lol
I only played this once lol
so are this chests within dungeons spread out in the overworld too
oh okay I was thinking that would be way too difficult to keep track
the lore to this game is so crazy
like when I first beat I felt like the villain waking up the wind fish
I was waiting for the twist at the end but you just wake up ALONE the end gerbieWAH
never knew you could take their helmets off lmao
do you know what the “extra” dungeon they added in DX is?
if you get level 2 item first then level 1 will it regress?
Hmm where is this in vanilla lol
gonna have to go back and try it out
never really occurred to me that D5 has both the worst boss and miniboss, neat
took me so long to figure out how to fight these
oh this boss have to be there?
hey its your fav boss fight
oh i should of turn on the setting on where u can switch the tunic anywhere whoops
my mum was VERY confused about the Octorok plush on your bed
she didn't know what it was
ooh, I like the change to the chat font
how long has that been there
think there a super jump for it
well certainly the richest seed ever
want to know where other sword is?
at Koholint Prairie - Witch Item (Sphere 13)
what did you think of the settings?
nice go on the sub 3 afterall
will you be down for another seed soon but where u start with x heart and you lose 1 every time u beat a boss
Ive watched a whole bunch of the rando VODs and love it so figured it was time
ive played vanilla PM so much its time for me to play MQ and some rando. Looks like it makes the game so much fun
just maybe a little bit lol.
rando glitch logic gear shuffle coinsanity upgrade shuffle no boots no hammer Kappa
Rando's just breathe so much life into old games. Makes you do things differently than vanilla playthroughs, and some things you can't do in vanilla
it really does. makes it fresh and new
If I wasn't doing 69 things at the same time, I would
I wish I had a device to play rando ResidentSleeper
is artifact out of logic too?
I have a 8 year old MacBook and a switch LUL
I did right at the start of stream
I wasn't sure if it should be in the channel or DM
ill have to switch back to the old version lol
the jelly pop kinda looks like a japanese dumpling lol
wow... you can go evrwherre but 6
we all just hate goombario eh?
up to u on the half grind. just use a timer still
Hmm I can't even think. Have you played it recently?
i thought you had 2 tubbas
everyone is trying to coerce it out lol
Devastating run last week such a good quil phanto274Cry
Ah just when my time to resub is 🙃
at least 5 is one scaled lol
my favourite chapter isn't available though... sadge
i think it wants you to go to chapter 1 lol
it is chapter 1 so maybe no
just drop my yaml in #sub-chat?
it would be cool if you could shuffle the badges amoung the gyms, like norman has heat, watson has mind, ect.
in version 2 beta waking kyorge sends rayquaza to sootopolis so it speeds that up
yeah, ive done it just so im familiar with it but it wasnt required
so far locking norman behind 6 has been a good change not making me fight him early.
wanna know what happened last night?
I forgot that GBi isnt on my serial port and had to switch to slot B LUL
but I have a GBi folder that was empty on my serial port so thats why I was going crazy
could the 3 blocks by koopa village have something or no?
water could be in ch 7 monkaW
one rando i got required me to go to Dark koopas at level 1.
peach looks like a goth lo
vanilla I love 7 just for music selection
dinner is what im doing atm
you guys also getting very mild weather? its been a weird winter here
ours has been +10 some days, and then -20 the next.
it's my friday and i got off early .. so very good, i hope yours is too!
seed wants you to be Thor with that hammer lol
What? I thought 2 was off the table
Hi! Long time no twitch. I've caught a bunch of your YT videos
i like the red sushi skin
ive never been able to avoid the dizzy
is chat not working on the screen ?
@buff00n Chat got Bopped and banned
i just got a second one
i wanted a high refresh rate so i repurposed my old one as secondary
why is miracle water out of logic?
hour in no star spirit ouch
how the badges treating you so far
any of them too extreme for worth
do you only need two seeds for blitz?
i prefer it when he has macho grubba skin
i forget which mod it was but a friend and me discovered a mod for pape 64 that stacked quake power quake and mega quake badges and when you had all 3 equipped it did 12 damage always
im guessing all flip tiles didnt get randomized
it would be funny if the quake badges did stack
this is a bad flower fields
that toads head looked like a shroom cake
it had the same pinkish color as the shroom cake
yeah it was going ok up until the usual points, difference is this time i've practiced
so idk its gotta just be nerves now
what are you missing right now, or is the tracker accurate KEKWait
i  dont know why but me and my friends always call the gulpits quagsires probably because they look like it
what is the purpose of blue key?
going to go back for your cake shooting star or just get better items
peepoIgnore "yo shadow pass the blunt" shadowSmokingWeed
its been forever since ive played
magikoopa saw you destroy the clubba and said F this im outta here
Nah fuck you ill watch instead
this looks english to me lol
im not a glitch person, so i would never notice
talk about a metric buttload of star points
Buttsbot isn't in here I must do their role
Yea I can se you're missing goombario
no hes not, hes just ignoring it
If they cause their own downfall that's on them
Go back and do it more
ive been trying to figure out the best one
how do you get the rando ROM on N64?
ive been playing Rando on Wii U VC
i like one of the 5 people that own a wii u lol
ours was bought launch day with mario U bundle
Or the strictly worse version of 3d world
Do you wanna go slower in the same game
wait the wii u version is slower?
You can go oob in wii u tho
one of the harder games IMO
gotta love it when star rod doesnt even work for him lol
hes dead and he doesnt even know it
I just had a good idea and am mad I didn't implement it months ago
my first attempt was 1 frame earrly lol
start it right away or wait til march?
i was eating pasta when you went live
Got some 811 and now Im chillin
I used to but have been early less often as of late
@stavros12c34anenoglou just cut the HELL outta my finger on the clock
well I should say 15 minutes, I started a little befor eyou went live
If you didn't lose that time at the end, you wouldn't be playing today phanto274Smile
Just need God tier quil again
doing good, found a mario puzzle at the mall earlier so doing that lol
I finally finished a 1000 piece among us puzzle... well not exactly finished it. It was missing 7 pieces and had 13 duplicates 🤣
It was awful 🤣 did my head in trying to get it done only to get that 🙃 haven't touched another puzzle since.
Normally love doing puzzles 😔 have a couple mario/luigi ones and yoda ones left to do
I want the tootsie roll now
How have you been liking Colosseum
Not that you'll be doing it much longer
I missed the frame and hit the power button
Darn we cant count out crits
You should always give 69 a chance
Imagine just walking around it and going about your business
I can see why they bagged her up she always in the way
Exactly. When I played this I tried to get her stuck on the stairs wherever I went
had no idea this had a speedrun :)
I'm looking forward to some more rogue arriving soon. I bought their sour candy one since it was sold out last time
@DrBarber88 never will have the tongue for it
is that because of how random it is?
have you ever had circus peanuts?
circus peanuts are orange marshmallow candy
A run out of reset hell, interesting
Balanced all the way until like nascour or adming refights
OK nvm balanced the whole run
What's the issue of pyrite Colo again? Is it a roselia?
Oh well now it makes more sense
circus peanuts (imo) taste like cream soda, if the cream part was more marshmallow-ish  I think they're underrated.
since i'm pretty sure no one actually owns the candy, you see them in many forms at most gas station generic candy sections
Swift, youll vouch for me right?
it's "ewPokemon" with the pepe meme
beg phantom for a free sub KEKW
marcoCry_HF avarie1Cry minimi6Cry phanto274Cry tippiCry marcoCry
i caught the end of that one run in my delirium and defo didn’t expect that plot twist
I have double pneumonia atm so life is hard
rng in this seems like absolute hell
No bad time only good time gminus1Angy gminus1Mad
dear pkmn colosseum community: we should use a modified version that has only masterballs - kthx
this manip reminds me of why i don't speedrun pkmn in general
make sure you wiggle your left big toe left to right during the manip or it won't work
just such a rough go at it tonite but we will conquer through.
I thought for sure I just now got but turns out if you go 4 frames early there is another naughty nature LUL
I think you should just always have it ready
idk how you do this kinda manip, i'd be so adhd and wouldn't focus well enough lol
im doin alright how about you liamkComfy
just one more it's fine, just one more I swear it'll be this time-
do you think Wes is a femboy when he's chillin
what nature do you typically go for for Umby?
oh it goes by ID? Neat
I'm getting my horny ass beat by a boss rn
Have to hit tight movement for like 5m cause this fish got too much health
this is the first time I've been able to really sit down and actively watch 😔
hour in... what happened? Miror B?
I had to deal with honse rng this weekend 😩 I got one (1) with Spacial Rend
Apparently RNG is 1/10 for Spacial Rend so it tracks but I want my vengeance on honse
how many frames does colo run on again
megaaEyebrows that is some evil split shit
i mean they're named pls sub - what better advertising could you go for ;)
had good progress to stone badgee
its not, for first starting out id be okay with 3 mudkip attempts per run
got to be faster axl KEKW
I manually added the one from yesterday
therre is space over the web cam LUL
im really starting to hate this blacktiger guy
im not giving him any item in archipelago
not a sub axl cant join
i am so bad at this game
let’s get this on Pokemon day
damn did dear not work or did you get scammed lol
imagine looking for all zyguarde cores in an open world game LMFAO
seeing the response to Z-A made me feel old
I swiped meter from jokehow LUL
wait yeah i did say meter
these are so hard lmao i played a game like this on my phone and it was free
at least I got the big one
dont ask how I got that
yes, get a run so I can go back to learning mudkip
damn i was just aboutto get that lol
do you flowtimer for this too?
is this kinda like the mudkip manip?
tell me next time and no one else
saw router but not route LUL
this game stresses me out way to much
they start with e or r
Oh we have a run phanto274GL
hopefully the rash isn't in a bad spot lol
i probably shouldn't try words on stream while also healing a raid in ffxiv lol
we can't have an unseasoned willie
I miss seeing Umby and Espy sticking their heads forwards like dogs out of a car window
i love when pokemon presents are mobile game directs, then end with a legends zygarde
i'm gonna wait like a good bit after it comes out, and it's sounding like it's mainly set exclusively in lumiose city, a la persona
my 32 oz shakers came in today :) the down side of it's size is i mix 2 colors that don't look good together
Yeah I have to imagine that they have at least 2-3 in the oven right now, but still, later the better
I still stand by that an extra 6 months in the oven for Scarvi would have made a more functional game
oh and the rogue energy sour candy is exactly as good as i was expecting
i liked the concept of SV, but man it tneeded at least a year or so extra to cook
A year would have been optimal
but schedules and all that for merchandising
I think the dlc expanded on it, but like, you should *not* rely on DLC to breathe new life into a game
it's amazing how many people on twitter are upset about legends ZA only being set in lumiose
it's gotta be like Yakuza impressive for it's city
listen, if we're going back to war ages, I'm here for the plague ™️
well, it's a redevelopement of the city, so we shall see
but I have seen a lot of theorizing it'll be futuristic
I’m so ready for legends za za to have the same shitty battle system
It might be like BW vibes where one is more futuristic and one will be more past centric, assuming they are in fact different versions and not Switch 2/Switch releases
doubles gives for way more strategy
i wish GF would see that
I am the only sane gen 5 fan after the presentation
gen 6 needed something more than gen 5
@Pallos7 gen 5 fans went ballistic lol
them dropping those hints on twitter was funny tho
also that gen 2 tease through the entire direct
gen 5 is my favorite gen but in the end it dosent really matter
'nice Gen 5 rug you got there. Would be hilarious if we ripped it out from under your feet'
ff10 is probably one of my favorite games out there
sure it was linear, but that just means the story is cohesive
I think it was mostly the power scaling for me more than anything that I had issue with in Arceus. Even without swift/strong moves everything just hit hard
I could disagree, given they may wanna garner more interest in the VGC stuff
I didn’t do that, I just used darkrai and fucked volo up
i stocked up on a shit ton of rocks and blitzed the endgame
then promptly got rocked by the dark souls boss that was arceus
There's been a lot of angry vgc players out there lately with how judging has gone, TPCi might push them more, who knows
the only time they really embraced it kinda was making all of indigo disk double battles
Yeah BB was p cool actually
BB was the gen 5 remakes all along
I did like 2 mins of grinding tbh
in fairness, I also partied up
I still have just like 25k hanging around lmfao
how to guess what the next game is, look at the legendaries they don't bring back to the current game
I am happy that ZA isn’t coming out this year
I'm still bitter I can't move in my spare shiny Xerneas but eh, there's always Z I suppose
Very happy I got my Violet model made up lmao
I would assume gen 10 is coming out 2026 bc that’s the 30th ani
ZA should have been a 2026 release, tbh
I was also very surprised that we aren't getting Unova if just for the sake of Unovafest is next year on Go and they're really pushing mobile these days
I think a problem was also that just. Sinnoh is not a good game to navigate around
in other news, shadow of the erdtree looks really good
I think platinum took care of some of the problems with it (esp storywise it was dank), but just moving around Sinnoh was ass until Legends
only for BDSP to bring them all back lol
I never cared for Sinnoh just cause it's ass to just inch through snow or swamp
I feel like a lot of folks thought the same. It's ass that ilca had such a hard game to bring back to life
gen 4 was when i started getting more into pokemon
but tbh like BW1 has such a high reputation I'm not sure they'd want to go about remaking that either, esp under crunch
for all the shit i give BDSP, it was quite faithful
it was VERY faithful and I think that's a part of the issue
since a good portion of fands have plated DP originals
i think platinum would have been a way better blueprint to draw from for the remake
for all the nonsense and flaws of Arceus, I'm very glad we got it. I think it was a much better tribute to Sinnoh
i did like the grand underground
this is a quote of all time
Uhhh kinda? I've seen you in fuckin Realgam
that's cool, different natures respond to purification in different ways?
I never realized how intricate this game was
I didn't realize that you only gained EXP after a certain bar unlock
Funny enough I think there's a few people in my discord IN Georgia
god. How does this game still look so good even with these low polys
og metroid prime still looks better than most games nowadays
I've been sucked into the architecture design
the little details have really expanded on it
i've had that happen like once or twice in my time playing this casually
I think I've gotten the 2nd rarest occurrence that can happen in this game
which is technically 1 in 8152 odds I think, but it has to be higher cause it was with 0 knowledge
Do you know about how shiny rolls in this game?
are u making ur self suffer again
🙏 that this is the run
Imagine your parents naming you Geats
its gonna be sad and lonley in the box
So what does the full heal + sp atk do?
full heal doesn't work but it can target Esp
because you can't target with X Spat for some reason
I can't believe you're cheating live on twitch dot tv
And potentially on YT if this PBs
shouldnt have said anything u jinxed it
how wild are the notes on this fight lmao
prolly hear this song in your sleep
Bro rolled the low bulk makuhita....
does it have a long delay on guesses or something ? Lol i said base 3 times
Sadge i come back and the run died
modCheck (I'm looking for the people who are willing to spend that isn't me)
this speed run is so toxic
Does that alert play for all 100 hits? LUL
would have thrown bits earlier but my wallet lagged i guess
I will laundry basket as I please
fan smack used to what now?
so i was away, what reset the run?
oh god, i remember that mantine being a wall even in casual
we shall see what kinda quillava
so what I'm hearing in the bg is just 'this is the suck of all time'
but it's very cool to watch you flying by the seat of your pants
I couldn't imagine doing this without some kinda tool
not 69%. what's the fucking point
still on a decent ish pace?
'there are very few things you can do to mess up this fight' Miror B: BET
Bike ride and negative energy out time to crush some mon with Phantom
yes the timing for human Machamp
Glenn, have you played at all this unite season yet?
hopefully they rebug masters and make no ex pokemon exist :)
You excited for 3 EX licenses a game
im gonna counterpick by going lane greninja
I played a couple games with Miraidon this morning and they fucked up
This dude looks like Axel for kingdom hearts only bigger and beefier
well i just hope it doesn't hurt my car, my lease ends next month and that would really suck
we gotta crank out and study now
What's worse is the revives you genuinely see up until realgam
Pooch strikes again in different game
Look at the bright side, you're basically done with this game
Funnily enough very close with that crit
You guys say Sadge but it's sometimes for the better for a run to die this instead of the end
I'm just used to this game being bullshit
you rolled a shit words phantom
streamer you are so funny and entertaining trauma59Thunder
Just leave it up the whole time
sorry i am bad at this gamre
I hope you miss the manip
Send a picture of jesse and say he's yours
Oh yeah I was in my basement for an hour because we got hit with the tornado warning
I have to doublecheck everytime now
I see it in the corner now I am dumb
I just want to imagine you've been resetting since
I was trapped in my basement playing League Bowling for the Neo Geo
It's pretty fun but the attract mode screen gives me a migraine
I need to piss but I can't leave
lost a minute on king boo, 1:06:32
this is far comfier to go for 1:05 against though
i just came back surprised to see you're still live haha
we aint yet at 5letter words + fake letters
This doesn't seem that hard with there being limit on sending messages
the song that sounds like deltarune
you can however share word knowledge so others can use it
i been to 17 once in a stream
I'm gonna go piss angrily now
At least I had PopeyesSpicyChickenSandwich for dinner
Other game I played while trapped in the basement is Neo Turf Masters which I heard is praised as one of the best retro golf games
are you ready for a full run
I also put a pizza on the cooker
Do you have to include the manip in the vod for src
Damn I was hoping you would have to put the words in LMAO
he plays the worst pokemon game so ofc
i have to partake in capitalism in the morning NOOOO
as long as it has Boris soundtrack in the background
does colo have phys/spec split like xd
xd only has it for shadow moves
colo's only shadow move is shadow rush, so...
oh boy Nintendo of America Files Lawsuit Against Yuzu Switch Emulator
So did the people that made Mt. Battle ever hear of a railing before?
Honestly don't know who's more annoying of a fight. Venus or Dakim
The AI knows to Taunt if you use a status move?
Is there a technical reason for that?
Been a while since I watched a Colosseum run but I definitely remember the final stretch being brutal af
How the fuck do I keep returning to this split
What happened at Dakim? Was it because of Typhlosion's speed?
So weird how you're just allowed to lose and keep progressing through the hideout
I mean it'd be one thing if something like that happened early in the run, but the fact that it's so close to the end and there's no backups is ludicrous
BELIEVE IN THE ME THAT BELIEVES YOU
I came at a bad time then lol
and practice for later is good too!
the game dragging out a run it already killed is the worst
my good binch why are you still going
are you glad that February's almost over
Welp 2 more days of February gn
im not even done with my shift yet lol
early stream i wasn't ready to get first Sadge
Yeah what is this early stream
was it axl who stole 1st?
@Axl_SR It's 1 word per lock
Yes an on time one today
I can do no more o7
is the next game gonna have slow starts like this?
I dont think I can solo anymore levels I think the points go too high after 3 lol
i legit couldnt think of any words
run's boutta die I gotta shit
not only that but there is a meditite glitch on it. And of course we had to get hit with it
it’s time for the true run this stream man just believe
is quilava the best out of the 3?
i completely forgot that this game doesnt have the split
bro no one cares about Meganium it’s fukin meganium
@oakest5000 i do it was my starter first then feraligatr
nice to know we can get the record this time
a singular furret can ruin all
@oakest5000 hope ur still here twitch is glitching but grass moves are better early game and i can combo the 4 moves better but i had more fun using the water croc.
buts it’s like the most bland Pokémon in both design and stats it’s like the Golduck of starter Pokémon but at least Golduck design is above average
the baby forms are fantastic it’s just that final form
best baby line goes to iggly and clef
yo phantom GL on the runs kidroc1Bless
at least its good spa hasty
what was final time yesterday? back from Adge
i just need to find the time to be able to do colo runs, my PB is currently a 3:56:20 with a 37:11 colosseum and 1:00:33 Reath and Ferma
my PB loses like 10 mins to ein because i had a death there
i use the dpad for moves and people call me crazy LUL
im so used to other games with the dpad that i just naturally used it and i dont like the stick for what would seem like dpad movement
aight gonna kidroc1Lurk while doing some FRLG derust GL on the run kidroc1Bless
Submitted yaml file for multi world
LETSGO i come back to a run
My message didn't show on stream but I actually picked DKC3
I thought tommorow was march but i just checked and its a leap year wtf!!!!!!!!!!!
why is bro attacking their own makuhita bro
id say equip the exp share 2 fights before it normally says to, but im not 100% sure if that will fix it
it might say in the dmg sheet for the exp
lemme see if i can find it
"trainer sheet" is where it says how much exp each mon gives
bro needed to get his real main for this fight
Shadow dragonite's exclusive shadow move is heal bell
aw no more miror b banger phanto274BLANKIES
Cat cam was in bed for awhile
awh 🥺 how adorable I’m gonna have to check it out
Hey Phantom, GL on the runs today
Vibrava kind of makes decent sense? but Flygon is too good a mon
I wonder if Dakim is related to Alder at all
@FatPidgeyBirb most of the stadium and colesuem family member get linked in later games. my fave family in this game is Gary and Oak/ red blue and giovanni/ Koga and Agatha
3 decent runs past brock after i got food i couldnt hit squirtle to save my life so the derust was fine
i think this run might be F'd because of how much EXP it has lost
3:40 quite literally clenching like taco Tuesday
lemme clip super quick to check
Thunder in Stadium 1 do be like that too
YouTube just recommended me this short of yours lol
it's so funny to me that just losing these fights and walking back is faster
time exploits in games are a funny 😆 thing
God what a mustache he has
no lie i close my eyes on the queen
2000 left turns to be exact
Did you say body builder DUMBASS?
There's something so eerie about the fact this fight has no music even though I know it's probably a glitch
Hope ur stream was good dude!
The pb at long last the [pb] we can rejoice!
man it woulda been sick to have time end when Ho-Oh blasts the fuck outta the helicopter
does that mean you are done with colo now?
gg, congratz on freedom from this rng hell
@blacktiger51 that is an understatement. You have no idea.
Ty died so much this run
I love typhlosion but this why i run meganuim for runs ppslay1Tantrum
@dazzawesome yay! we are on the same team!
You can move on from Typhlosion now
Have a good evening and enjoy the PB after all the suffering
ALSO KIDDY KONG IS STILL STUCK AT BURGER KING
emerrald 2.0 is now on beta 3
so no redeeming beta seeds, got it
Why did you make me the throat goat
okay so bizhawk setup wasnt that hard
but I cant pause my emu
when I gen it auto runs bizhawk but it wont take inputs so I have to manually open iit
to be fair, cradily head looks like a fist
good luck, im jumping in my seed now
Are you excited about the new run?
That's one of the only Zelda games I've never actually finished
Rough skin for a punching bag is how you kill yourself
how do I pull up the list of all the stuff ive received?
ive connected cause ive started rreceiving items
oh! I can see the items on the website before I actually reeceived them
ive got some good stuff before starting lol
balance dynamo, SS ticket, and SUPERR ROD
I found one of the gym leader badges in my game
so whens the goal to be done with this?
Why are you abusing me like that poor makuhita in Colosseum?
it would be funny to ride the mach bike out of the moving van LUL
if im gonna play this for a while I set my clock to the right time in case I want to plant berries LUL
minimi6Arrive    a10cjBarrelRoll   GLHF Dune was an epic 7/5 msterpiece
I am stunned by ur choice today. I would legit be traumatized
okay this is funny, with super rod I caught a level 29 drowzee before rival 1 KEKW
nice tagteam u got there and even better names
okay this is funny as hell
sky uppercut fire spin blizzard and astonsih with TRUANT
@blacktiger51 ur now a psychic flower
About to hop on the AP
Lots of good stuff from what I saw earlier
Wow it really was a lot from 74 but buff00n and Blue had some useful stuff too
Just rare candy once so it cant do it
I need 3 more bear coins until I can do 1 check in DKC3
i see you are ready for the grass pokemon check LUL
ive never seen it rain in rando
ditto is just the coolest mon
I have a shiny max full at card of it
Doing pretty good today, how are you? phanto274BLANKIES
captured our flyer and ur a mon
Route 119 or Route 124 (trade for Green Shard with Treasure Hunter)
You probably just need to find it in the pool then
@SeventyFourTG just sent you a bear coin LUL
WHY ARE 1UP BALLOONS IN THE ITEM POOL
Hoping the randomizer is going well!!
Bear coins right now are good but most important thing is the boat upgrades
so I was about to run out of checks so I did granite cave out of logic and I found letter. I also have SS ticket so my seed is pretty open rn
also the fact I have pokeblock case there is prob something in safari zone
Yeah pokeblock case was in my seed
we want all the phone numbers
why does twitch give me french Adge
phantom says french is your native language
I get Spanish ads occasionally YEP
i know more spanish then French
Or I got several right before I got turbo
id love if someone sent me a Dragon Scale since im maining a seadra
only fair since suicune has lightning rod
oh, i thought it was lightning rod
oh right! I cant do safari zone check without surf or the bikes
found a new main, Megang with eruption, thunderbbolt, vital throw, and wing attack
reminder if you didnt know, you can only hand in the scanner after the mind badge
I had a go mode on that and couldnt figure out what the trigger was so I had to look into the tracker to find it
I wish I had Roxanne's number FeelsBadMan
roxanne you don't have to put on the red light
Crobat faints "No Slim Shady!! You have to stand up!!!"
have fun battle every trainer LUL
okay, thats everything I can do right now
and im not doing optional trainer battles lol
youre gonna love the rotating trainers
Though the next update should help by fixing spinners
it does, plus you only get like 8 phone numbers
is there aa way to save my curreent checks on emo tracker?
amazing, didnt know you could save on emo tracker
work's got me traveling all over, which means i have a lot of paperwork
its nice we can just check the site for updates. It would suck to connect and check in only to find 2 potions lol
can't tell you how often i accidentally go down instead of up right before the gym leader here
I looked up routing maps for emerald
full restore, that's like 1200 pokerdollars
There isn't a good 7TV emote for flying
do this room with mach bike
its so fast you cant see how many pokemon they have lol
i mean the start of a battle
magma base on the ocean makes no sense
i thought theyd fix that in oras
aqua grunt got the devon goods LUL
game freak are cowards for not giving shelgon shell smash
was anything on dad wallys uncle
i found a few things like bababas
im back from the zaxbys zensation zalad ad break
Will go ahead and pick it up, sometimes even with "progression" labels things can be not very useful so sometimes I like to check
if you dig through the floor on aqua base u will drown
I see u have a weepinbell....
imagine using dig on a bridge
that white rock had a lot of rumos back in the day
i hate that the implemented the rumours into the actual oras remake
I think you might have to do the gym first
they want a faithful ruby sapphire remake tho
this is emerald tate and liza afterall what do you expect?
now you can battle magma LUL
What's the next game to run BTW?
Oop, OK now it makes sense
Yeah it's long as shit as glubbers told you
Yeah the beginning to mid part of the run is very rough
Only run any% if you like slapping bo
Look what I just found in phantoms discord
If you like that mansion go live there tiger (I fucking hate it)
Another bear coin has been acquired
you need to see the image I shared LUL
You have a Magic Rod now
if Legends ZA gives us Mega Clawizer imagine how large his claw will be LUL
did you do the dive locations?
did you get "dive from steven'?
Actual last location for Flash of all things
thats latios final vanilla move lol
I don't think it could've been the badge instead logically
It would've led to Flash eventually
But Victory Road needs Flash so couldn't have been logically postgame
today marks 10 years since twitch plays pokemon entered the hall of fame...
i made two iron bars in lava and lost a minute 40
OH I DIDNT EVEN SEE ROXANNE's
what is this!? Twitch Plays Pokemon!?!?
its TTP's 10 year anniversary of its completion!
hey what's the one hundred and seventieth pokemon in your pokedex?
yeah let me GET THE RED ORB FOR THE BLUE POKEMON
WHY IS TEAM AQUA SO DUMB
this cave is where you get something heckin badass in vanilla
gonna tell me kids this was the second coming of jesus crhsit
seed must be real bad if this story progress was-
dragon dance machoke is le heckin based gaming
Wallace sees your setup and raises you
Speed Boost, Dragon Dance, Icy Wind, Focus Punch Eevee btw
all the baby pokemon then that
never got me to level 30 Madge
Castform is probably one of the most common Hoenn Hall of Famers come to think of it
cant help you in this game i don't know this game well
wait, I should check rando world real quick
OMFG. Am i in heaven and did someone run me over while I was driving.
thought you were talking about Chucky for a sec
oh yeah this is the fishing rod
thought someone was passed out on the floor of the house for a sec
there also another chest in link house too but it req lamp
Weapons boring just start throwing hands
i started my lego build today blobComfy
Can you hook the vine and drop down?
Yea without a jumpslash I dont think you can get that lol
if u stab a enemy u get cool stuf
i never played tp so im useless as usual
ok u go around get bugs
i last played like, 6 years ago
give bugs to the rich girl agatha
boomerang is a must for them
as for poes Wolf transformation is required
u find the floating lanterns throughout
The lantern helps u with mist and torch chests along with finishing off the game
that guy gives my fave hp u need to carry a barrel of water to him when bridge is fixing
minimi6Notes phanto274Notes spitle1Notes tippiNotes on the surroundings
and it was probably raven who was already in here lmao
was pretty sure i was gonna wipe
in glitchless logic u should have gotten the transform crystal in the area u spawned at. and another freebie is epona. Did u do Goats (twice)
omg twilight princess!? are you going to the blue rupee wall clip?
I wouldnt recommend mass collect focus only on strawberries
rando twilight princess is the game
is this that "suika game" the twitch streamers love so much?
does it play like panzer dragoon?
based nintendo kneeling to the SEGA chads
if (about to collect berry) { no(); }
This bird can go take a hike
"Wow! You're so lame! ...wanna try again?"
welcome to first time rando tp
No rando for wii u though
also omg TP rando. how is it so far
I did a full clear of emerald, rigbys last badge was in safari and pokeblock was on Juan, whhy would anyone do Juan LUL
I think now you wont ever not do Juan Kappa
I had 100% this like a decade ago, I'd have to learn more than half of everything again myself
this is rando I thought this was a speedrun lol
oh meaks since you are here now
tons of pape rando vods there LUL
Im not a real person as a mobile user...which means I can do anything and no one will know SeemsGood
so after I finished my seed the only checks left were 2 in safari and ss ticket from dad LUL
that old goron u need moeny to donate
tbh this or Skyward Sword randos may be my first two Zelda's i'd learn rando
they are the two I know best out of all of them
I have never played this game before, so just act like it is all going to plan and I will be impressed
nice that you have one clawshot already
I mean its go mode once you get 1/2 milk right?
oh snap, I have surf, stone badge, strength, and waterfall,
How big is the multiworld rando that you all are doing together?
Yea that is really cool to have that many people
Pape Mario multiworld rando seems like a fantastic idea SeemsGood
What if we just squeeze through here real quick Kappa
that typically has the cannon to to Sky dungeon right?
iron boots heavily needed in this area
I like how they took the beetles from MM and reimagined them
WHO WILL WIN? SOME NEW RANDO PLAYER VS 3 funky little dinos
I have my money on dinos
this is gonna make a great clip
You're telling me that this Link can wrestle and throw hands with a goron... Can't handle the helmasaurs
hey just as a quick question, since it's been a while, if anyone knows: can you just clawshot to kill em
because of the bluepee I felt bad
Thank you for the gift sub!
You should give me money @lordlevias19 phanto274Smile
Ok but when people are learning that's when it's most entertaining lbr
you have a sub lol @Ohrocks phanto274Mash
Buff00n got me an athena soda
I will get it in precisely 2 weeks
oh, wait, no that's right, cuckoo flight
and on the lake u need boomerang for the mid island hp
@stavros12c34anenoglou you can boomerang the heartpiece??? Good to know, I always did flight...
unless I'm thinking of a different thing
what dungeons do you have to do?
BLJing in this game is a very funny mental concept
That sure is a three of all time
I used to have the whole players guide to this game. It was a big manual and had awesome artwork and detail
so what is shuffled in the pool?
no bugs and poes is a solid idea tho
did the rando cut down how much rupees you have to donate
theres the heart piece guy in castle town. donating for "peace"
does logic require upgraded Malo Marts as well into castle town?
there is a claw shot iirc. will need to come back once you get spinner too
there may be ivy on one random side too
I noticed it when you warped but I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me
when you did the warp and the cutscene happened
i like the dark purple Midna hair
take the one that runs away
i recommend pulling back on the control stick to brake with the cuccoo
'have you tried braking your chicken' is so funny
cool you found the vibe septor
Time to do it again SkeletonPls
So not only did you get a nice rod, you also got a big ball and chain to go with it
now let's see if you get TWO rods
starting out how large is your wallet?
honestly, not a bad "potion" to have
wait, did I see that you need to activate/re-activate the rod?
ok ur slowly understanding and now we got some very good weaponry. Still keepin quiet
ball and chain though is VERY VERY overpowered
are swords random or are they progressive (wooden -> Ordona -> Master)
There's gates you have to smack with a boar iirc
not the Cave of Ordeals lol
It's bad enough dealing with Savage Laby in WWR, and that's 50 levels
the last room was three darknuts iirc in a small area. kinda tough my first go through
I think it's 4 mighty nuts , potentially some wizzrobes? IDK. been a while since I perused
unless we're talking TP, I never completed tp
Would be a shame if it caught...fire....
Listen, I've played enough OOT to know
fuckin grateful MM doesn't deal with that garbage, but in exchange, ice traps + Zora...
not as fast as Dry Dry Desert now that I think of it
You know what sucks? Ice Traps underwater. Like in Pinnacle Rock
this rando is looking like a lot of fun to learn so far
i think you need to attack the roasted boar
I wish fancy beyblade did more in general but its uses are pretty fun
agreed. that one room in Arbiters Grounds is fun
can't call for backup if there's no people to call for it
this ball and chain strat is ICONIC
have you seen this is getting worked on for AP too? 👀
i think u be ready for some dungeon clearings
nah, i think they are waiting for the next big update. i don't think Lunar is doing the dev for the AP side but he's like helping i think?
i just know it's like eventually happening LUL
are the characters for the book randomized? Or is the book already full when you get it?
Is the reward for collecting all poe souls randomized?
for this seed poes are not randomized
that and insects are not randomized
iron boots and zora armor are needed for lakebed
you can also get there with just midna from the uhhh. Forest temple
I can help remind you how to unlock temples
I agree with Telma's bar and see what the squad is up to
how could Link leave behind his larger wallet at home and take the smaller one smh
:v you sure you can't just walk in either?
be funny if that was just the solution
Those are some heavy looking shoes
with that rod u can move statues
stav, do you know how to activate rod
@FatPidgeyBirb yes u talk to the lady in the village after a few quest items.
@FatPidgeyBirb coming in clutch with the emotes *chef's kiss*
listen, I look for any opportunity to OOOO
never let phantom play rhythm games, got it ✏️
(Bill Nye voice) inertia is a property of matter.
its finezo no minding but gonna head out. GL on SENSING things out.
oh before i do Love the blue hair orange hair and most of all purple tunic.
take a shot every time they say 'yo actual chest?!' and get rupees or st instead
don't threaten me with liver failure and a good time
I'll resume playing later gonna wait to see if there's a call I can stream it to
I booted up and didn't get anything
I remember the chest is close to the perimeter of the map underwater
Also there are multiple lua script so check to make sure it's the right one
I've found you plenty of bees buff00n
I've been here, just lurking and playing my HK
love that youre also enjoying this run. this stream was what I needed today
okay, I got everything and done what I could
if someone could find me a lamp and a sword, I'd GREATLY appreciate it
Oh fun, someone got pulled over in front of my house
\o/ I found my water bottle
I hate that this makes me wanna play more rando BabyRage
the VA work for this game is faboo
fuck you and the boars you ran in on!
i think on the opposite side, you will be able to push it aside
unlocking a short cut once you are there? someone correct me please
it leads to the elevator that leads down into mines
I agree, the logo leads you to think theres something you can do immediately
I do like the noises the bublins make
worth getting blown up over and over for!
sorry just got back and heard the name
let me look. is that not referring to Lake Eldin
Oh, is that the one above the spring
youll need to shoot a bomb arrow to somewhere atop near lake eldin
this check is in the village. walk towards lake eldin
look up and there will be bombable rocks with a bomb arrow atop an edge
is there only one chest labeled for watchtower?
chat, correct me, is this the check where you shoot an arrow from a far distance and hit the pole on the tower?
That could also be it, but that would be labeled minigame I would think
you are more likely correct than me
it's been so long I'm trying to scrape on my casual hundo knowledge
standing in the lake, facing towards the strip of the town, to your left atop the ledges
like way up top, you can bomb something with a bomb arrow
yeah go dive and explore with a water bomb
I think there may be something down there
Ye, that is what you blow up
I'm googling, it does look like you have to cucco
you bring it as high as you can and the chest is on a ledge wrapped around the watchtower area
I am manifesting gale boomerang energy your way
top of the mountainous area I think for the puzzle
bet your zora armor is your next woth
rip miss the whole seed friends made me play d2
it's on the left side apparently
neither have I and that's why I-
i think its on the east side of the region youre in
Cause I checked a video and it's right against the wall
ice puzzles are bad and unfair and they are my least fave mechanic in video games most times
Is Cat Village a logical check in this??? if not the rando sucks
No, it's that little sidequest at the very end of the game you typically do first to uhhh, Epona's Whistle
and you have to talk to 20 cats
idk how i feel about this rando
It would be nicer if there was more individual appeal like OOTR/MMR/WWR
wouldn't be a rando if you didn't feel bottlenecked
you know what would make this seed better? a fishing quest
access to the snowlands, I think
I think this is how you catch reekfish and track yeto normally
from zoras domain with equipping it to the fishing rod
I like that the villagers don't freak out at you here
that's why the cat wasn't saying anything to you
when the bobber goes all the way down you have to hit something
The bobber is your fishing guage
Use the stick to pull back in, iirc
Reel back in when the bobber is in the green zone.
For PMBP: In a Roguelike run Goombario gave me Power Bounce. Forgiven
I think I'll be skipping this rando LOL this is so spread out
there's one you can get to with clawshot
is it time to do hot water run? ModCheck
I was gonna say I don't remember a cockfight game in this
That's a different Twilight Princess game
If it's actual bird on bird betting violence I'm out
It's been so long since I've played this game, idk.
If you really, really need me to, I can probably dig out my TP game guide
'under the flight by fowl platform'
"To enter this grotto, engage in Flight-By-Fowl and head right, back towards the start. You will see a small platform jutting out of the wall (with a poe on it, if it is night). The grotto can be found amidst the grass on the platform. "
I'm so tired. I've been awake since 5am Saturday morning.
I am now 20 minutes into Sunday.
Brb, need another cup of coffee to sip at.
you're in north atm I think
That skinny clown looks like he "cockfights" iykwim
They expect you to see in this?
Have you tried a shucking knife?
misread as shocking knife and I was like 'that can't be good for you while you're in the water'
No, but really, brb for real, need caffeine or I'll fall asleep before morning.
Malomart I think you have to do hot water run to take it over
Shitty coffee with decent syrup added.
(but I hope you enjoy it)
I literally need it to survive.
I give me that perky pep I need for work.
I wish I liked it, but I can't do the taste
All anyone needs who says they don't like coffee is a quality roast.
and tea just tastes too much like leaf water to me
I doubt that tbh, I don't like alcohol at all either
There's a roaster one town over from my town that does like thirty roasts of coffee, not including seasonal ones.
oh you have water temple now
How close are you to finishing?
I bet boomer's gonna be in here
the buttplug looking stalacites, may I add
Anything is a dildo if you're brave enough.
Do some stretches, it'll be fine.
this is a psa since we're talking rocks and dildos, DO NOT use Malachite for a dildo!!! it is UNSAFE
Malachite is a pourous and dangerous material when it's subject to water
it's why you can't wash your malachite with water and why you have to be *real* careful making jewelry with it
I had not idea of any of this.
I saw an ENTIRE tumblr post once on why you should not fuck the malachite stalacite
and then I googled further and was like 'oh hmm yeah ok that's a no from me chief'
you also can't leave it out in sunlight either, it loses its color
@FatPidgeyBirb I'm reading that post right now and it's compelling.
i was charging my phone before i go to bed on my ps5 forgot my dumb ass turn my ps5 off KEKW
it's a FASCINATING read isn't it? Classic Tumblr had its moments
I love when people apply science to horniness.
This has been a very fun '5 hours of Phantom Gets Shafted by TPR'
and i missed 4 hours of it Sadge
unfortunately speedrunners are very stubborn and do not quit easily from what I have seen 😏
the game said specifically, 'fuck your cheating, you learn TODAY'
This seed might be a scrub.
do you know what the other 2 are?
i hate city in the sky
Gale boomerang is needed in some instances iirc too for Sky
City activated my fear of heights in my original playthrough back when.
oh yeah those with acrophobia would suffer that dungeon huh
god it's been too long I don't remember 😔
there should be a treasure chest at the top of the big circular room where you change the staircase, I think, that you might be able to get to via clawshot
the documentation for this doesn't seem the best
me, recognizing how much from wind waker was used for this
agreed, they should be in the order you will find them while looking through the game files
most trackers have that kinda common sense
That is a nice thing to have, but in some games, it's hard to do that if there are feasibly multiple possible orders
Alphabetical, though... not ideal especially if names are made up
go with the rest of this
that's a lie, Subnautica did it well
i would hope subnautica does it well
oh right the unholy joining of wart and gekko
ACTION is chased out by the rhinos
same way you raise water levels in other parts of the dungeon
(it took me so long to figure out there was a door spring)
ok but this boss design otherwise fucks
I wish Morpheel did more phase 2 than swimming around
You could have had that so early...... 😔
you have the thing to give to Shad
No, I mean Shad revives it with the book you give him
wait, AGATHA? i thought you turned off bugs
those sound like very important items
No, mantis are typically loose bugs I think
That makes a little more sense
I would love to help if I could remember this game well PrideLaugh
ain't no shame in calling it in shit and first seeds tbh
wait that doesn't make sense though. What does turning off bugs mean then?
kinda like skulltula tokens being overworld, I imagine
yes stall out so I can get 26 more points 👀
Will be in VC doing DKC3
Madge i was afk and miss 1st
don’t worry I’m always late so you’ll get it next
that was a one time thing
Got 4 more DKC3 checks done this morning
yo mistake seed means perfection speed seed
I can actually use my bonus coins now to unlock extra levels
Could've / Should've stayed at work, but nah, fuck that
nice drink made of pure poison there
oh wow chapter 1 and 5 is done phanto274BLANKIES
and the item on the block is something YEP
did you end up beating the tp rando last night?
wait pow block hits the bullets phanto274D
oh shit yeah i didn't know she was still randomized if you turn that off rip
i seen someone gave her a bug and she gave him a bug back
geez that is a lot of hours
Which rogue energy flavor would paper mario enjoy most
the one green one cause it reminds him of the poison drink in his inventory
the red key always feels like the hardest thing to find in seeds
I never even knew that was a thing
yooo the sorcery used there was incredible
you do have a stone cap
its not about longer seeds.  its about keeping in mind the whole game instead of just a few chapters
Paper Mario isn't exactly a metroidvania, sadly
id rather see that you need less bosses but all chapters are in the pool
cuz thats what is making all seeds feel samey imo
well yeah it makes the seed literally half as complex
getting a new phone was so stressful
Jr Troopa, the true menace of PM 64
uh, was that just to flex, or why didn't you squirt with sushie
Dark Koopas at level 1 BatChest
I heard vibrating like a phone
I'm sure you explained what you're experimenting with, but without context that's some weird places you're going to when looking at the tracker
So, basically 3 specific spirits, but who knows when you will reach them
oh ur going for a second go around
is this a mad science experiment SMOrc
who were the fastest readers in the world?
9/11 victims, they went through 98 stories in 20 seconds monadoWheeze
@Allegrenix that joke tied a very thin line but will be passable
doesn't it give yellow yoshi  check
watt is gonna be in the tree after ch2 YEP
Gotta love a 3-chapter full clear
Finale once again ur goin down turtle
Cheer100 Kermit: Oh wow, that’s cool. Not really. Also, I can complete it even faster, so, that’s probably mid speed. Also, I did report you on my game’s page and banned you, sorry. Also, not sorry, I am the developer and screw you. Cheers.

Cheer100 Asmr: I don’t think anyone realizes how scary Mario is, he can hurl things he has no business being able to carry (such as Bowser), can run at a consistently fast speed, and can jump 3 times his height. Even worse is that he’s small, but has enough punch force to smash through a stack of bricks (which is more than a battering ram). If Mario wants you dead, praying may be your only option
i didn't get to hear the cheer NOOOO
ok guess I have to kkona again
I just love him calming down
I need to learn the other kkona sounds
Raven came packing this sunday. I guess feeling a bit Froggy
That's the only one I have saved
My day has been p shit I just needed to hear the screaming KKona to feel better
They changed the ui I couldnt figure out how to buy bits while I had them for a second lol
The button is my bit count
and it's not a different color
Oh wow someone is def going tri core today
glenn do you wanna play unite tomorrow
Yo I have work tomorrow too BatChest
I work like 5 hours! :)
its for that energy drink that tastes like piss!
just kick the children fast then come play unite
It also includes alcohol based on the color of the shit buff00n bought at frosties
that shit was the actual visual of piss
the soccer team thats professional plays in a kit that looks like piss too!
the piss kit went 0-5-8 over last season
rando race was good glitchless died to jumping on a pyroguy in chapter and getting struck by the spear guy outside of the dark room NotLikeThis
but PBed in rando (1:39) and beat Adam by 6 seconds LUL
Made a great time baking the cake for the fatshyguy
Cheer100 (door_knock) Watchmojo: If Goombario has a million fans I am one of them. If Goombario has ten fans I am one of them. If Goombario has only one fan, that is me. If Goombario has no fans, that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Goombario, I am against the world.
yeah and Rowf was turned off but post ch5 chest had something and Rowf had last stand lol
I know I will watch it back
Cheer100 Tired: streamer can you please just... go faster.... this seed has been going so long and you have no items.... please spare us streamer
Coneys chat always gets it to sound more depressed I need to learn the ways
I was curious if that would work like that, guess so
Oh Star Pieces might be why you got Super Boots immediately
im not even going in tomorrow because its snow storming so bad
might have found a rental in that town, its available at the end of the month so hopefully they give it to me modCheck
because fuck driving fifty minutes one way
basically two hours out of my day RAGEY
Are you doing a standard playthrough? I haven't played this game in over ten years, but you popped up
forty hours a MONTH just in driving
My commute is "only" 25 minutes
ive only ever briefly lived in town whenever i was like a pre-teen happ i cant wait for everything to be a minute away
yo is that THE cats four ever?
@happatrash don’t have audio so don’t know if he said it but this is a randomizer, shuffles everything in the game to somewhere else
It's things like this that make me glad I live in a somewhat smaller city
oh shit my bad, thanks for correcting me
you had to let them know
Sometimes mario just needs to give a good pounding
the strange leaves i consume make me feel funny
sometimes the strange leaves i consume are in candy too
my lungs are just a lil too fucked to be consuming any leaves for a while
so, I COMPLETELY underestimated my dog
made her a piece of chicken and she made that thing VANISH
What a coincidence with my message, it's actually my bedtime lol, gn all
turned away, turned back and it was GONE
but I'm not giving her shit
i want some chicken now too, but i have ground meat thawing in my sink right now D:
@Iceblue how can i help you Clueless
come make the ground meat in my sink into something pls
debating if I thaw a piece of Swai or more chicken
i have taco seasoning, i have spaghetti sauce, and i have other stuff
@Cats4ever don't threaten me with a good time
no cause i don't eat lettuce, or sour cream
Cats, I'll bring the onions, salsa and jalapenos
now wait, i'll take the jalapenos
i wanna make spaghetti tonight, but i'm also lazy phanto274Smile
oh this is how you get goombario
Somehow slammed two large DQ Blizzards in a week
yo can we get DQ blizzards at SGDQ
It's gotten warm enough here to warrant it
We get it a bit often now because we have access to a family discount
im hoping my immune system is gonna be back by sgdq cus dying was not fun
yeah all the time in ch7
he is now in the great beyond
my dad did while i was moving, i put him in a cute lil bowl and he was like "oops"
man TTS really blew that one
should I save my ALttP checks for vc? @SeventyFourTG
I'll stop by if you're planning on streaming
buff00n turned on ALttP and was immediately assaulted by a swarm of bees
Wait can we send people bees or something
@BenjaminDatum in ALttP multiworld you can
i died to a ice trap in forest temple near the end in a MW i wasn't happy
It'd be very funny if we could attack people with bees
@RavenFP my fault for doing the dungeon at 1 heart
@blacktiger51 yea be healthier next time
wait you have more than half the items but no star spirits? Is that normal
my seed was a sphere 10, but mystery note made it sphere 11. I went so far out of logic toy box was my first clear LUL
bombette was sphere 8 in toy box but I ggot her super early lol
ultra hammer in volcano vase chest
I feel like this game is just super broken so I had to ask
Honestly surprising that we haven't found a way to modify where warpzones bring you yet like zelda or pokemon lmao
it’s a shame we never get to see Goombario’s color swaps
Glitch hunters need to step up their game /s
i totally forgot it was Sunday
lmao wtf is this mc donalds
be easier on yourself man lmao
Is it just me or are glitches so much more fun in rando
the thing that led me to go out of logic was merlow had a shroom cake lol
nevermind, mario 2 had a red hat
phantom, who do you think has the best color swaps of this game?
it is indeed the original Mario colors
@janitorbeav actually the original Mario colors are that of Donkey Kong
at least its Cathy and not Karen LUL
do you have an english patch?
been keeping an eye on AP, 9 checks have opened for me. but I dont have fly so id have to go from dewford to fortree on foot KEKW
I learned something doing a seed with rigby, my feather badge was in his east safari, which you cant reach until champion. But once you beat the champion it just releases everything lol
You know what I can do instead of going to Crystal Palace?
Please don't hate me for asking. What experiments are you doing? Clearly ill catch this one on YouTube,  but I'm curious
Ok! I usually tap out once people get go mode because Bowser is usually the same most of the time
p good reddHH still a lil sick but made it happen
weird how you have only found 1 key lol
you don't have a forest pass?
id be hillarious if they were just both in Tubba castle
KEKHeim KEKHeim KEKHeim ghunzoLul LUL HypeLUL tippiGiggle EleGiggle
wait you can get to the star haven shop sometimes if it has a logic item?
I would not have guessed it was the beach
i guess this is why you have a method and stick too it
And streaming 8+ hours. Makes sense
anyway its 2AM here i gotta go to bed
When Phantom turns on the Pape expect an 8 hour juicer stream
boss says you gotta stay late and finish those seeds phantom
My god, to see you up at this time. I'm usually awake, but this is weird for me
I saw the notification earlier, I just didn't realize lots meant LOTS
Tommorow we go again with 3 insane DK64 rando seeds
Mentally, physically, and spiritually prepare yourself gamers.
who tf let red bull make a final fantasy 7 commercial
twitch suddenly wants me to play that final fanatsy 7 remake a lot
that i do not actually own a Ps5
I'm actually really curious how long this multiworld run would go, cause it's seems to be moving very quick
I think the excitement and hype started it
Absolutely. This is my first, and I'm already getting my own friends into it with Minecraft and Factorio
The choice of games, while not infinite, I think is a good variety
I'm actually more annoyed that Noita is there and I didn't see Isaac, but I'll have to check the discord then.
YASSSSS im mod there thank fuck
Another day another nearly 7 hour rando attempt
this isn't digimon rumble arena 2
Digimon Rumble Arena 1 is gonna be at Combo Breaker this year
@SeventyFourTG that's why I mentioned it
We were talking ab it like 10m ago lol
Did you kill agatha in cold blood
@RavenFP Also Rivals 1 and Sonic the Fighters side brackets
Why did you inform me of the 2nd one
Why would I care about that one
I know how much you love Sonic
How long did this take you the 1st time you did it?
You must've clicked the big DO NOT RANDOMIZE button
So what do you need to actually finish this rando?
Is there a setting to show what's actually for sale in shops not original items?
i just put Hyrule Castle Requirements fuse shadows
this feels like it would be a slow rando
Link decided to return to natural hair color for the fight
the rupee bag in the tracker looks so....flaccid.
this was such a weird game
"Thanks a ton, Link. Have a nickel."

I learned how to break watchmojo
Been taking notes from popes chat
Epona: freaked out by mutant birds. Doesn't care about explosions.
i almost never got around to play this game. got here and saw the spiders and hit the power switch so fast
you stab Ganondorf with a sword
really sad to think this was the last good zelda game
looks like citra and yuzu emulators are gone
time to find a new 3ds emulator now
why? It should still work. Not like they can send a kill switch
guess i leave citra discord now
There's already a group of devs that are aiming to make a better 3DS emulator since Citra was essentially abandoned by the official devs
are all the 3ds emulators just shit
OMFG looks like no quit today. TP rush is in full effect GLHF
if you already have the software downloaded, can you still use it?
i was waiting for citra to get updated to hopefully make tales of the abyss works but guess not anymore
looks like Panda3DS is the 2nd best 1 as of right now but no games list that work
i love that every time i start this async it's like 5 minutes of getting items lol
Apparently yuzu also stole a lot of code
Looking into their team more they're just assholes LMAO
yuza was also leaking early copies of totk and mario rpg
Tonight I'm having a Blue Raspberry Sparkling Ice® +Caffeine. Wish it was Rogue Energy.....
The new starburst sparkling ice is pretty good
Family bought a 6 of those. Would be better without the cream soda notes at the end tbh.
"hey dumbass, you lost your shield -midna"
At it again at the krispy kreme huh
yeah and they have wodden barrels in goron mines
ganon gonna get his wig split?
perhaps there's an overworld chest you need to get first?
idk what logic settings you're running
oh wow it actually was damaging them
not having that quarter of a heart is going to kill you
have you even done diamond/pearl without fly tho?
emerald has extra story garbage yeah
don't even have to backtrack for the evil team base
ruby would be bad, having to go magma hideout
Part of the problem with Emerald is areas with one-way gates where you have to traverse half the region to backtrack
yeah that 1 u just got
aw shit here we go again
I betcha wolf link is in there
there are a few checks outside lakebed with that I think,
that's what I like about WWR- boat driving is far less dangerous
The thing at the top ? claw
I forget, can you claw on Epona?
Yo my favorite Zelda game! This looks crazy LMAO
as soon as i seen that i voted rando so fast lol
Dude this game has such cool speedruns
I'm mad they skip my fav temple in any% but it's also cool how so lol
I really like the Temple of Time which idk if thats a hot take
how far are you in practice?
what are you planning on doing in arbiter grounds since I know that one has some wild stuff in it
Ive waited over 5 years for this, now I can finally use axlsrF
@Axl_SR u just made ur own emotes?
I think you roll into it
how dyou prepare runs like these
so ur telling me you dont do the super clip into the final temple to obtain one single chest check?
After you complete this dungeon, go to Kakario Village, ask the gorons to bring you up at the very top, and talk to Malo. Malo will tell you to do 3 things.
KEKW Epona was attatched plz clip
After completing Goron Mines, talk to Talo who is on top of the watchtower in Kakariko Village to start the archery minigame. Starting the game allows the item to be bought from the shop. (Note: You do not need to complete the minigame. Starting it is enough to put the item in the shop.)
now this is more comfy to me tiger being the backseater
my fave hp had vanilla hp LuL
@stavros12c34anenoglou best part is i don't know this game KEKW
Use the Clawshot to reach the vines hanging from the southern side of the Bridge of Hylia and then hang off the ledge and sidle over to the chest.
that check you was just at
Use the Powered Dominion Rod to move the statue to be used as a stepping stone to reach the chest.
u need to move the statues
i never knew how to get that chest as a kid
are you talking about the shop check here?
if this was zootr or mmr i could tell you where everything is beside pots
on the west road of Castle Town is where Charlo is
]this is where my fave character is
the star mini game have another check now with double claw shot
i wonder if the devs can code in can warp without master sword
doesn't the master sword give you that
wonder if the devs can code in  can warp without that but you still need it to go wolf link
I had to go do dishes
It reminds me of Temple of the Gods a lot and that's my second fave in WW so
best dungeon is snowpeek worst dungeon is this 1
I can agree tbh, but yea. given what they have and have not done with the rando/how shoddy some of the settings feel I wonder if they would be capable of implementing that
I found a patch that fixes the sky in ttyd64
you still don't have wolf form?
aspect ratio looks the same, I compared it with vanilla
(I've been lurkin so I'm here twice)
it's just a different sort of practice
at least speedrun movement can carry over to rando
Oh. You typically need wolf for this
what do you mean? Friends! :^)
I think plural is Oocca? But I could be wrong
twas good, just finished up wind waker
yeah i'm still learning tp rando too
i love watching those deku  babas fall into the abyss
my next game is gonna  have a lot of verticallity. gonna be playing skyward sword after a pikmin 1 rando
At least the worm had the courtesy to put you
but it's a great concept of double claw
I like it, I would go more teal personally
blue midna is just so punkish beyond belief
Shield! Exactly the opposite of what you requested!
Ough. I suppose I should open up VS Code and learn some more Python
I was readin before I hard napped earlier about tables
oh, you were supposed to uh
The thing. The ball thing I think
You know the room with the ball that you didn't activate?
The one with the fan? Cause you have to descend through the blades
I'm looking and there were two of them apparently
last dungeon with a wood sword YEP
WHO IS MORE SHITTY: butterknife, or wooden sword? (my bet is wooden sword)
The thing that makes me think butterknife in WWR is better is that at least you have parry and everything just available to you with it
heyo good luck on the run. hows it going so far?
well thats good! whatd you find in the second dungeon?
Ridley is a hell of a lot smarter
in fair you are fighting essentially a dragon with a toothpick ;0
as much as i hate city in the sky this boss is cool
I'm just gonna call it toothpick from now on
It'll bonk but probably not splinter
this is just comical. 9 rounds here we COOOOOOOOOME
You would have access to Fairy Tears at this point so it makes sense to be damage based
this remind me when combo rando made me fight bongo bongo as child with a broken knife it was ass
"I know that, I did it several times. When I said he wasn't turning I meant that I had already hit him over 75 times and he still hadn't taken enough damage to change his attack pattern"
internet says you may be right
maybe its just a damage check
75 hits is... a lot considering master sword takes 3, and ordon takes 6
and its not possible with that sword
or maybe he just take no damage from wood
it's either a heinous hindsight or a hilarious one
well you are supposed to lose the wooden sword so
pretty sure in link to the past if you fight the lost woods boss with white sword you must spin attack or you do 0 damage
they must have figured 'ain't no way people are going to purposefully try and make things harder for themselves in the game' and then here we are
game please give them a sword
I bet one sword is in arbiters
I've never seen a rando gatekeep sword this hard
I wanna give AP a try some day
Oh neat! I hope it's lots of fun for you all. mikeyl19MagicRod
I know they're workin on Celeste and MMR for it, very fun stuff
How goes the rando attempt? I had to pop over once I saw TP.
I'll probably wind up lurking at this point and relax. But I hope this continues to be fun!
What is a wolf? A miserable pile of rupees!
if i ever played this i would do key sanity
i like my toxic af rando
As someone who does all sanity in MM even I turn off keys LOL
you can skip a few in oot
you can skip a few in MM as well but I do like keyrings in OOT as a theory
you only need 1 to beat shadow
you can skip woodfall and all of snowhead keys idk stt since i am bad at that dungeon
Most times you just do ISST and skip univerted
and you can do most of that keyless
boss keys are suggestions if you're good at glitching in MM
i always get lost in stt lol
i know the other 3 dungeons well
i know the skip to get to the eyego
A dramatic one but the bot is speaking
havent playued this game in SO many years
i dont know all the tricks
practicing the early well trick still rough
I tried the combo rando but...so many spheres.......
but im still in baby mode
randomizing songs warping you to certain locations was A Mistake!
i dont wish that trick on anyone
this is too cool as a boss to skip
nah fuck the frames fight stallord
do you think there's anti-dizzy tech included on the spinner
so he's a chicken AND a wolf?
no Adge in this boss fight
From what I saw the people who were doing wooden sword run only had trouble with Arga so I imagine you can do this with
gee I wonder why it isn't as much damage as master sword
it's okay Phantom. You can borrow my master sword PrideUwu
this has been sword the gatekeepining
you know game i was kidding when i said 75 more hits
Hit it harder with the stick
Toothpick has been funny to watch at least
I think that was heart container\
cause typically you don't get an item here otherwise
Can I get a peek at the spoiler log given it's been 7 hours? I won't say anythin if you do ;0 I'm just curious the state of your hubes
Yeah I'll let you know if it's heinous
So one of your swords is just completely out of logic, that makes sense
Hmm. How spicy do you want your hints
i can't imagine master sword of all things being not required
Where the southern winds to adventure blow
FWIW your illogical sword is in Temple of Time lolol
" "Temple of Time Darknut Chest":"
I'm guessing that's Sol Master Sword
i do like me some sword with those darknuts
so you're correct in that there are 4 swords total in game
you can kill ganon without master sword
at least in this seed it isn't I don't think
oh wait the video lied no you cant
you can beat the 1 phase
I forget, what does the earring do again?
but if it's locked how am i supposed to commit insurance fraud
I really need to replay through this game again
it has been a long while for me too
I literally haven't played this since 08, so it's been WAY TOO LONG LOL
Well TP is a long game
same, to both it being a long time and to not liking fishing
I like how stiff the arm is LMAO
The cat stole our fisk ;-;
i should really go to Bedge nah
you got 1 hour then its Bedge
YOU HURT CHUCHU this will not be forgiven
I'm pretty sure Link is getting too excited and impatient with all these pots in here
fatpidSip I think you got all the hints you need
how did pid get the log
Rubix desperately looking for a 'toss item' redeem
actually I have an exact video for that room. I'll have to put it in your discord PrideLaugh
Then i take it back and makes Good RNG
and now the universe is unbalanced again
Phantom, you may have sent me the wrong log I think
lemme check the next few names with you
you know the last seed did have temple of time
how long are the average randos in TP
I was gonna say, cause you got sword from Lantern Cave in Ordon last seed before
Omg I like your Augumon and Gomomon plushies
You had some on display a little while ago right?
It was sure the wrong fish
only bottle i didn't get as a kid was Collect 20 Poe Souls
This has been something you have been dismissing, in fairness
Oh, do you get a warp point to there? That's good actually
How's the learning process been so far?
i think i know what phantom miss
I am thinking of this in a very much 'standard gless progression' kind of sense
i hate doing the fishing in OOT
so I'm not sure how much it will be good for rando,
i mean i could just tell you
i hate doing the fishing in any zelda game except botw, can't beat shock arrows
im hoe for two and a half days woo
im hoe for all the days
the roomies are chatting over twitch
did you donate the guy money
damn and you are 50 short
why didn't he just get himself out with those bombs
does the rando let you transform in front of people?
Would you like me to just tell you a finer definition of the location?
Typical progression says you should be able to
You can catch a reekfish tho, which is the weird part
there a setting that skip the red fish
So bad tracker then, got it
You have every item I can think of to do this kinda stuff
your tracker is wrong and i don't know this game well
the other two swords are Arga locked so it cannot be them
You did get your sword in Gerudo Desert, I remember that much, so I think you sent me the correct one at least
But you get ball and chain in Snowpeak Dungeon itself! That's so...wrong
the dungeon requires it to be finished
if you need Ball and chain for this, I have the location
Hey so what's your FAVE minigame in the game then
Good to know Ball and Chain are required for these checks tho
isn't plumm at the bottom of lake hylia?
Plumm takes you up here, then she takes you down
Maybe. This rando is weird to learn about
it's very much not fast friendly
pretty sure you can get oob and void out it and count as you win after you get 10k
I am a merciful hintmaster, you've been at the seed too long
Yeah that's why I just flat out told you
I will tell you: It is not in Sky
it being on Argarok would have been very funny
'btw I had a sword you could have used to defeat me with'
it sure was a grotto of all time
Bedge gl with the rest of this seed
hopefully next seed i can see the ending
I am armed with advil and sleeping meds
We just finished a nearly 7 hour Oracle of Seasons seed
Yeah, I had to look at the spoiler log for one thing
Cause I honestly didn't know about this entrance
And it just so happen to be my d6 :D
you got many hints from me
I'm still laughing it was on Plumm
Did you know there's a dig spot staircase outside of d7 i nseasons?
Yeah, it was my d6 LUL
Rando is so funny and good at teaching you locations
I was like "what the fuck is that location?"
I didn't know there were so many grottos in this
there was also a cape at the bottom of a river
Also, did you know there's a Gasha seed in HEROS CAVE
I thought OOT did! but I stand corrected
Starting with wolf may be a good setting for TP tbh
like how everyone and their mom starts with Soaring in MMR
I found out tonight that there's a gasha seed in Heroes Cave
Cause I was looking through the wiki for maps
And I saw that and was like
I've certainly learned a little aabout the rando just from watchin tonight tho that's for sure
very hard and long ya say? 👀
You ever just disable someone completely?
She had so much last time it was FUNNY
ok but Plumm required vs Agitha checks: FIGHT
bug locations are ass to find even in vanilla
this is one of my favorite zelda boss fights
Argarok doesn't care about ur hard wood 😔
Phantom, the moment they announce the GDQ location, we gotta start researching alcohol spots
Zant knows exactly what he isn't and that is a final boss
Yeah, let's research that tonight 👀
Can I buy it for 5 rupees
city in the sy sall ey
"I shouldn't have to finish on you" - Phantom5800
I got some late night townhouse instead
there's some leaves that show the pattern
no sorry it's 21.50 after tax
😔 Dog shit states charging sales taxes...
I do like this guy. only 3 lines and what an impact
Yeah, it's like lights being in ganon's tower or in Phantom Labyrinth
MM only really has that in like, Fairies/Skulltula sanity
well you can't get to GT without Master Sword typically
I'm jonesin for a good WWR again
Listen I know this is all for the sake of 'use your items and shit' in the final dungeon but I want to fight the architect of this castle
God I love these fuckin Darknuts so much
this took so long for me to figure out dw
idk if you knew this btw, but you can also dip your lantern right in the oil
Yellow chu also work in a pinch (the nonshiny ones)
I do wish we saw more of finishing blow
Hey we heard you hated darknuts so here's two of them!
Helm Splitter is Shield attack, then you press forward and A while the enemy is stunned
Mortal blow you uhhh. You sheathe your sword and the moment an enemy is going to strike you get a prompt to draw your sword and attack them to kill them in one go
Please pray for them, they are suffering
I have also learned an lot watchin
I remember some location with a buncha soldiers you can sense that I haven't seen
I double checked ,you should not need dominion for this
unfortunately your owl statue check was your map
Literally the last place in the game :^)
rote from doing it so many times
And keep in mind: TWO of them are here LOL
why is there 20 billion checks in here
ww the deepest room in the game is 1 check and can be 1 singular progression item
MM it's technically the moon but technically if you get to the moon you can finish the game
I gotta wake up all th sleeping ppl in chat so they can see the cool sword
Pidge do you wanna hear it get more fucked up
I mean may as well, we're in the final gauntlet
Ganon has that dog in him
As soon as I saw it I was like 'Ew'
Treasure Room turned off too yes yes? 👀
I beat Persona 3 Reload today!
I think most of us are stuck
I think he turned on literally everything lol
all I sent Rvpa was a ice trap LUL
I know the first time I loved sky temple but im sure my opinion has changed
captsh3Hiding watch out big raid incomming
OBS cut out randomly in the middle of my stream
i was just playing a rhythm game
GL with this dungeon, i hate it LUL
looks like i am getting TacoBell for dinner
Dang I want some taco bell. Their potatoes soft tacos are delicious
I am just ready for the nacho fries to come back
Been watching your pape rando so here for the lurk
It was good you just need to climb the ladder faster
In fact, you have to get to the last rung and let go as soon as link grabs it
insert the MGS ladder theme here
That was too early on the second drop
Link: "Someday, I will get to the top of this ladder, and destroy that monster. Today is not that day"
Like wait a little bit but not too much
this was one that i was pretty excited to watch you learn to run phanto274ColonD
The method I was telling you about was this
It is for the second a
icy 🥶 peak madness is going on
Don't think you can skip it
What's weird is that timer O.o
How soon is this trick in the run?
saw the nitro deck+ is up for preorder for the switch, may actually dip for that. Having both sticks on top looks more comfortable than what joy cons offer
Glub also does the quick lja iirc
OK so where it's 100% oob KEKW
And I found that thank you very much
For me it was like, it definitely feels faster, they timed it and it was
If I list mine it's gonna be like 12 KEKW
Oh this was before wolf jump was a thing
Everything is huge but ganons dick
it must just expect you to get them order
Glub explained it to me almost a year ago
And yes I don't remember the exact reason KEKW
do you go this way in ad
in glitchless you just turn around
if you swing your sword you can roll after without talking to him
I've seen people genuinely sidehop when they're near him to not talk to him
For bow he does do the lja to have a good cycle though
Oh yeah that shot is bs
He ironically lost a pb to this fucking shot
if you go to where those pots are
By refusing to go closer like I said to him 20 shots earlier
i feel like going down doesnt actually lose time
Tiniest bit like 3-5 secs or some shit
The issue is your contender is beest who's been the closest to be as consistent as demon was back in the day
I mean beest busted his ass off for the longest time
I was there when he was starting funnily enough
Because I'm sorry but that shit is either 2 hours or like 7
you can use the settings i do, which are like blitz settings
There's a preset from the French
i only do 3 dungeons, start with wolf, wooden sword and shield
Yeah that preset is how I started
i can send you the setting code and you can see if you like them feliheSit
And raged and quit, but hey they're friendly
i turn off a bunch of slow checks as well lol
If gold wolf was free it'd be good
But going for the howls no thank you
Or visited the area, or set to dungeon clear or idk, something
oh i turned off keys as well
i think the only gold wolf thats on is the first one in front of forest temple
because the item is just there
Oh fuck me I don't have it pinned
I talked with it to glub but like ages ago
these seeds normally only take me like 2-3 hours so
did they fix the rel loader thing
a while ago it would just crash when you tried to use it
with rel loader thing you can actually play the game off your disc instead of nintendont
it loads off the memory card
it is nice but idk if they fixed it yet
what tracker are you using NOTED
i use the lunarsoap web tracker lol
turned on horse call but its not super useful lol
tp has a lot of things so its pretty good to mark things tbh
there a timer on the tracker
oh i forgot the whole map is open lol
the warps used to not open until you went tehre
now even more checks are open here
with clawshot you can basically get them all now lol
good luck with the run! How're you liking tp randos?
yeah it seems fun. would like a reason to go back to TP
idk where all the poes are
they are like this in skyward sword too
sshd is very good if you ever wanted to play it again
it does open a couple checks
its in one of the houses
also this one doesnt spawn while the zora lady is here
you know what controller maps great to N64? uring the wii era I used a wiimote and nunchuk for N64. the D pad mapping to the c buttons was just perfect.
lantern does open a few things but i dont think you need it
you can use the bomb thing on this
i think if you target it with the boomerang it will come to you
im not sure what happened lol
they are required to beat the game though
did you know you can catch those
and add water bombs to your bomb bag
they are both in the temple of time area
you only need the first part for tot
you need bow though i think
i have a setting on that if you hold R while using the spinner, it goes super fast
in this little area with the broken chest
oh yeah you need spinner to get to the top part
oh door of time is open
i dont think you can beat the boss without bow
I take it the rando is being kinder than it was last time given you have wolf and also you're in a dungeon
Double dipping, the bane of Zelda randos
No more searching for a toothpick
what are your dungeons? ToT I imagine
this will hopefully be a much faster seed then
oh they put it in a box for you
yeah this is typically how it goes
bot told you to slow the fuck down
Punished for not doing Plumm Part 2: electric boogaloo?
you should try the fast spinner thing
you can jump to that as wolf
this shows the lja too lol
surely we need something in order to cross this ledge
i think aim more to the right
there is 1 check you can do without iron boots lol
surely it will be iron boots
where is a bird call next to the cannon guy
just so you know i did turn off the boat minigame
if you had a shield you could use the shield attack
i think you can get them all with wolf
did you get the inn chest
they made this shield too big
i kinda like the smaller design of the ordon shield
you can get there from the warp actually
glitchless is hype just so long
under the boulder has a check i think
but you cant do that peepoSad
bow and iron boots in there felihePausers
I GOT A NEW PB IN PAPE
USING DOUBLE DIP LIKE YOU SAID
i love this dungeon and hate it at the same time
yeah shaved 25 min off the old one
i guess i only know glitchless tot
i tried learning that but could never get it lol
do you not get zora armor in this run
oh god you have to fight the boss without zora armor monkaW
you can clawshot the target through the hole
oh i meant the clawshot target
now how do you do this idk
bow will be in one of those felihePrayge
I'm glad the swords accept me for who I am <3
Yes arrive to my fave dungeon.
How is the co op going so far?
there may have been one right there but this one is special
this room makes my skin crawl
this is also how I kill spiders in my house btw
that is so fun and satisfying to watch.
welcome to co op tp rando
stream was good, had another almost 1:05
yeah given the fact the time is usually lost to boo shenanigans
Making it blow would be cooler
i did get an armory boo gold, one cycled it PepeComfy
They probably intenteded for spinner to be like that but then they realized Epona would be redundant
Isn't epona slightly faster than Wolf?
pretty sure i just roll everywhere
but this is more fun Spoots
i think you need to free the cuccos
the cucco is where the hot spring is btw
you can fly to the roof
3 hours in and no sword upgrade
Swords are a myth, like ice
you get to it from where the bottle dude is
i dont remember his name lol
theres some rocks you blow up
theres an upside down one too
youre not supposed to eat bombs
yeah the magnet walls are so funny with fast iron boots
zelda bombs look like delicious bluberries tho
link has not been skipping leg day this seed
I don't like TP Link's run animation and poster
TP Link may have awful posture, but DAMN, this lad can LIFT
vanilla bow technically if it has a bow
if i guess that on everything ill always be right
that mean go mode is master sword again
this game is too ahead of its time
spoilers i have to wait for Friday to play it
its possible a master sword is in hyrule castle
you don't need light sword to win right
@blacktiger51 light is only used on Zant
its from targeting something thats higher than the level link is on
like the boomerang has to be on ground higher than link
"this isnt working because the switch is pressed down already"
just got abra manip without much trouble, it felt so free
5 frames within a 6 frame window. frame 2 is bad
does the bot just say random stuff
master sword in tot for the lore
well i do have a strat to fight them but its not the most optimal way
i have no idea wasn't looking
ngl the photoshop ad kinda cool
it was 1 min and 30 seconds of Adge
i guess they have ai tools now
and i knew it was over when i heard tp
the Adge i get here are always 5 seconds or 30 seconds
thats a good bombomb impression g
if you slash him and then jumpslash he get hit
i think as soon as you press yes
no this is a silly video
that video is really good though
i would just check castle at this point
theres also like 15 checks in the lantern cave in lake hylia so
watch lamp be in castle and swords in that cave monkaW
i missed the beginning. what happen
you missed the sub 4 sword hunt
got a oreo Adge and a ff7 reamke Adge
wheres shad when you need him
Is this a race or a archipelago?
how are you playing with Feli?
are you having fun with these settings
telma uhh theres no one else here
now you have to sniff the medicine
i think the medicine scent leads to another check
i always play with a cheat that turns it into just normal armor
so i can just wear it lol
barrier skip is kinda free tbh
you just jumpslash as the cs starts
lol it was 4am for me
i think i clocked out on dragon
do you know how to fight the last phase
for the first attack, you just slash him and then run behind him and jumpslash into an auto spin
then you just keep going behind he and doing that
and he dies in like 3 seconds lol
you can do an untargeted slash
you only have to slash him for the first time
unless you miss an auto spin
I see we're finishing the rando within a decent timeframe
nice not a 10 hour one
i can send you a clip of this phase if you want felihePrideSit
this clip is good because you can see the backup for missing and autospin too lol
I’m watching my oldest brother in his weightlifting competition
currently getting beserked by ads 1 moment
i got a top 3 and a top 4 this week, it couldve been worse but im taking it
trying not to do too many brackets so im skipping out on tns this time
i cant stay for too long so i might lurk for a bit, hope your run goes well!
i still need to learn a few characters just to learn the matchup, learned shun yesterday and i might use him
hes way too easy for what he does
do I grab Korean Fried Chicken or eat at home
they have another Athena soda, so you can drink one and keep the other
I'll eat at home, I didn't buy a new air fryer to NOT use the damn thing
I've been up since 11 and I'm still half-asleep
that's what I get for skipping breakfast
time to rob the 0-2 bracket
sounds like an 8-bit version of 98's Old Men team
holy shit they are live AAAA
every drop is just a happy little reset
Also got hit by work jumpscare
i should just forget all of this
my boss better not try to call me in
Just don't perform it wrong otherwise you'll end up in the backrooms
it would save so much time avoiding crowds
alright i'm going to get food i'll be back in a bit
Playing this game without notches is like Minecraft's development when Microsoft bought it
Notch sold Minecraft to Microsoft and by extension stopped working on Minecraft which slowed down progress on updates, or what people call "the downfall of Minecraft"
at least if I recall that correctly
I was thinking that's where something would be
I think with 4 being last, try to space it out evenly
What if you started top right?
Hello, sorry for bothering you. I want to offer promotion of your channel, viewers, followers, views, chat bots, etc...The price is lower than any competitor, the quality is guaranteed to be the best.   Flexible and convenient order management panel, chat panel, everything is in your hands, a huge number of custom settings. Go to streamrise
sounds like my timing is goated
can you still replay that minigame for rupees in rando?
i want to use clodsire but the current power level
they can't really do much else
it wouldn't be terrible if it could do damage
and to rub it in my face ogerpon gets water absorb as well
but like it's not my favotite yeah
wo chien is su ugly it's charming
killing the flowers with the intended weapon
it's more intended that the usual
if you got the lead right and sent out clodsire next to glimmora in front of urshifu that would be a very sad urshifu
we hate that bear in this house
i don't really know what urshifu does or has done in the past in that game
does have a move that he can just hold like lucario power up punch?
i forgot you are playing cringe wind waker and kept wondering where the movement went
have to do it intended again runera3Eugh
can you break those with the hookshot?
uhhh why is the note to mom in a casket in a temple underground
anyway latest steam proton update made a certain game fully functionally on steam deck
also I’m assuming this is for archipelago
phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam never heard this song before it’s awesome
if i learned a 2d zelda run it would be this game probably
do you play this on emu or the gb gamecube thing lol
how much would you say rupees matter for randomizer
Lol i remember the first time i played LA, didnt know you could steal, i got the bow the hard way
i have before farm the 980 before the 1st dungeon
lmao, just brute force it, itll be alright
and you 1 hit him lmao
aren’t you gonna mark what you’ve collected
time for the onion to die
you know she could be possibly levitating right now under that dress with the way she’s moving
for some reason the seashell check is dog food somehow
I watched my oldest brother compete in a weightlifting competition today
He got 2nd in the state for his weight class
but it would still be stupid and annoying none the less
yoooo he’s kinda crazy with it
so much grass I’ll never touch
oh my god this games bosses
nice shirt also Barbie’s dream house is in this game?
so why didn’t you grab it?
can’t you fly over them with the bird
with how many holes are on the world map I’m surprised you even have stable ground to walk on
Marin wants out of the simulation
by the way your marking list froze again
what are you supposed to do here
why are you making Marin fall in love with that door
gohma nuts how bout that you stupid spider
and your reward was a stick
Axl Story time: One day I was vibing with guys at work and this Mercedes pulls up. A girl gets out and we were watching her. She turns around I say, "Bruh, she has the body of a kingdom with a face to guard it." They absolutely lost it! Laughing so hard they could not breathe as we all scramble to get inside the building. phanto274Ohoho Cheer200
more drugs, I mean, magic power
other channels I normally do 200 due to their alerts so I did 200 without thinking lol
this game really wants you to get that seashell check
if your wondering the check list is working on our side
guess we won't know until we find them
i dont remember how to fight this guy normally
maybe the bird can kill him
Sorry am late. Was watching another stream when you went live
Not going well I take it?
I've never played this before, so I'm lost lol
buttrier is the secret third calyrex horse
the next game after z-a that they announce is going to to be legends butt
that’s why I feel so helpless watching this gyro guy cause I want to help him  but I know nothing
Swordless NES games tend to be that way lol
if only he knew that you played his songs a million times already
I really need to go through this again. It was the first with pokemon blue that I owned for gbc. Hey Phantom.
i forgot to give snorlax lunch deadMario
yeah when i checked sleep a couple minutes ago there he was gone when it loaded
yeah when i checked butt a couple mibutttes ago there he was gone when it buttded
why would a key be able do make a tower do that
I wonder why it's called a face key
will check vod later at an event
Inb4 bombs in the last check
what is the point if you don't have swag
You know what I mean >.>
Gameboy games are basically still NES games lol
honestly youre lucky if you finish before 6
nah, you've had to double dip every one you entered so far
gotta collect 20 for a check
Do you change your name to Sally and sell secret seashells on the seashore?
And what do the Stone Beaks do?
The Pieces of Heart don't even fully heal you
Bombs gatekeep a lot it seems
what if zelda was a game boy
Imma go grab some food. Hopefully you find bombs before I get back lol
Well, you've got a 1/7 shot of that
No idea what D2 is. Just saw the symbol in the item screen and assumed lol
There's a lot of 50 rupee rewards in this game it seems
3 dungeons just became clearable, right?
Do I fire emblem or splatoon
Dang, and neither of those bloopers dropped shortcut switches
Guess that's the tradeoff for being oneshots
He really says argh I'm outta here
He didnt feel up for a spanking today
See that's what he should do
Maybe hit one first and then try double hitting the other two?
I come back to phantom on both my monitors
I guess go do it again? xD
I guess room switch and then save quit?
I just got here, but I think you do have to screen transition to get the collapse to stick
they just walked over nothing wtf
daid had some amount of mercy, apparently
Oh damn, left for a bit to get more food
This is the last bit, right
this was a seed that happened lol
I continue to advocate for some decoupled ER
And then immediately bomb blocked after sword
i loved the dog seed, especially it eating random villagers (also brb ads lol)
Charizard  is 1 of the starters
Ditto is 1 of them too
Left is Treecko and right is Mudkip normally
At least Swablu will evolve in 30 levels
So Thunderbolt would give a reason to sell Thundershock
I wallace actually wally from the future?
these early trainers have it in for you for sure
Could give White Herb to Salamence for a free turn 1 Sky Attack
If you use Overheat, it'll overwrite the Sp Atk drop once
Right, forgot Thundershock and Mudslap were low power
Though Outrage still had to take 2 go's on the Zigzagoon
I forget if I asked this the last time I watched one of these, but is the PC Potion randomized?
ooh metagross is great.  cant be para'ed cuz of ability, cant be poisoned
You use more fluids when you're hot
Drought isn't allowed to be an offensive ability
The ultimate insult to me. Putting Flash on my moveset
On the tracker, what does the 0 on the gym mean?
Cause having badges on their own is what progresses things, right?
Except for story flags, since beating Roxanne triggers the Aqua thing
I wonder. If you had the set up, would the regis be randomized??
That'd be hilarious to see something like a castform in the place of a regi LUL
Methinks this is a lost fight lol
LETSGO i have a dragon type move now
Might be time to grind a few levels lol
i made a dumb mistake and need to a LONG mental reset, so i had to cut stream lo
is this pokemon emerald kaizo rando
i didnt save in projector room but thought i did
so i did the reset and then was like oh i only have 6 boos now and i should have 15
oh my in time for a bonus stream. GLHF
i love the mon and names even moreso
You can't use HM2 though without Feather Badge
And gonna get owned by Doom Desire in a dec
Oh that wasn't so bad actually
The item east of Briney's house?
Yeah, just pulled up a map and thought the exact same thing lol
Not just that. Tiny children giving an older child their phone numbers!
But they all wanna fight you
They waited so long to meet you!
hey there! Im from youtube lmao
the rocks by the wingull cave? Isnt there checks there
Did you get the item to the north of the flower patches?
I'm looking over a map and mentally confirming you grabbed items lol
I thought that was story locked
That guy gives Bullet Seed TM immediately in vanilla
So do you do like all kinds of different randos?
Well, no Department Store access unless you can beat Brendan endgame lol
ive been doing the MM/OOT combined rando. SO much fun
and yeah crystal is so much more open
Wait, is the move relearner here?
fat exp if you beat it
1 turn freeze very cool Muk
Is Surf locked behind 5 badges, or Balance Badge?
At least this is mad EXP
Focus energy into a 1/4th areial ace
I always the "Use reletive strength" setting in emerald
and the nidorina with  sacred fire YEP
ever since i ran into a mewtwo with calm mind and psycho boost at the first gym
i think the thing was, the moves in gen 2 were not as good
so a quillfish is a steel type now
HOLD up did metagross just learn 2 moves in a row
I come out to try and help and get insta frozen!
doesn't he have a level 30 pokemon
Don't you need it to get to Victory Road?
Lots of quality time on this boat lol
Do you take these all the way tol steven?
I just did a full playthrough of A jiggie in time
Not only did it break through Paralysis, it ALSO *landed* the Horn Drill lol
the bango kazooi/ zelda cross overgame
its baically a 100% of banjo  lol
TP rando is so good but REALLY rough
I use some large settings, i had boomarang  locked behind  cave of ordeals and bow locked behind  all bugs
I didn't think the AI COULD do that
i got stuck so i looked at the log after like 2 hours, and rerolled the seed lmfao
Agatha is 30 checks isn't it?
And Poes is.... I don't even know
New Mauville itself is Surf blocked
I was hoping it wasn't Cut lol
So whats th archepelego thing you mentioned ?
Is it better than Universal pokemon randomizer?
One of those cut checks might be Fly
oh neat im checkin it out
Was gonna ask if it was 1 person per game
i wonder if you can randomize dark cloud
i did a MW and someone had 3 seeds lmao
there is a chest rando for dark cloud i believe
Paper mario and zelda  would be sick
You get sword in chapter 4 lmfao
Still a couple cut checks by Trick House and then you're caught up iirc
Unless you did those when I wasn't paying attention
oh there also a chest rando for dark cloud 2
Dark cloud is one of those retro games i feel like not alot of people have played
oh cool there also a enemy rando for dark cloud 1
What if I give you really shit settings and make that the worst rando you've done?
This map shows 2 items here for some reason...
i do big no logic/max settings MM so i know how a terrible seed feels
remember the toxic jumpless seed i gave you
"this seed was a nightmare"  \
all it takes is one to pop off
the fact that the badge for sure
i don't think i seen that video
Video is just shy of 4 hours long
you think icebound can do it
Sadly you didn't put the seed in the description
That is one sickly looking Kecleon
All moldy yellow instead of green
you did ask him to turn around
Didn't know Electabuzz could be invisible
Pretty sure I found through Pape too
I found you after watching a majinphil video. HE was doing a rando, vid ended and it autoplayed a paper mario rando
tmc rando is Deadge not my fav but will still watch
i dont think ive seen you minishcap ones
because i never played the game
i think i found pape through pope it being his mental refresher game he sometimes start at prologue or has a file after it.
I think you deserve more views personally
that funny i found pope cuz phantom raided him lol
Alright, it's been good hanging out, but I gotta hop off now. Good luck with the rest of this lol
Jcog is just the coolest person ever
always sgdq to get a picture
no way u both are smash player in cpu level standards where u at?
have you tried kaizo ironmon? Or is that not your style?
it took me 1700 attempts to finish one run in firered
like 900 of them died to rival 1
there is a papermario run going on the gdq page
greetings from my family’s lake house in wisconsin
I’m taking a road trip to Minnesota with buff00n a few days after I get home
1 time i watched someone whole stream and got no Adge
i got a Adge on someone else stream
i don't even know what its does KEKW
If there was a nuclear apocalypse where only Jessica alba and I survived and we were tasked with repopulating the world I would kill myself rather than force myself to fornicate with her because i know that our offspring would look like leprosy stricken monstrosities to the potential ones that could be made by a heavenly blessed beauty like yourself.
hell yeah, get fuckt Wall-ass reddHH reddHH reddHH reddHH reddHH
bad seed but 2 good pokemon
that will be they problem to send us somewhere KEKW
got a plate of chicken ready for this stream
just wanna say fuck daylight saving that is all
I just want to let you know
and no I'm fine. I just wanted to let you know that PrideLaugh
I did. I meant to stay up earlier, but I knocked back out PrideLaugh
wdym, you dont wanna watch a penguin be scared
I actually just want a chance to murder some of those pengins
your not alone in that Jaye
This is my cat when Im trying to do something
I want to cuddle that kitty ohheyi30UWU
he seems like such a big sweetheart though
bet you thought i wouldnt return
This is making my whole day better
i cant put the stream on my tv wtf
my cats love to be on my desk Madge
i got school tomorrow its 1 am i gotta sleep i just came to say hi
i was afk when he was here Sadge
Just give goombario back to his family
I think I might have done something similar with bit math in Lua at some point but I'd have to go back and check
oh, so we checked the wait times and busyness at super nintendo world and it looks like hell right there right now LOL
same. by later in the day, like half the people left and it was so nice there
I see we started with Goombario!  Blessed Seed!  PrideCheers
In all seriousness Good Luck on the seed (or bad luck if you want content instead)
"I love getting rewarded for cheating"
Yippy now you can beat chapter 5!
Laki is all you need in life
Laki can fly you up there ezpz
Isn't all seeds bad the usual?
gl hf! when you come up with a decent helper function for the flag bit junk, please let me know :]
watched two of your VOD’s on YouTube today
async 10 and I think 9 as well
two of the most recent uploads yeah
I watch a good hunk of the vods as I usually don't catch any streamers live too often. My fave recently was the link awakening where your sprite was bow wow lol
Currently vibin and grinding event items in ff14
my fave bit was when link killed a child xP
@dappycappy which event, moogle tomes or the Regalia?
tomes, I did regalia a few years ago
just coming back to game after a two and a half year break without a tv
I can do it in my sleep but good lord
still free trial for now but totes wanna buy when i get tax return
my poor bard is def overleveled at this point xP
lol.  the game is worth the purchase, though the monthly sub cost is meh
lol i love how Laki is basically the Game Shark for this game
what kinda see we workin with tonight
glgl, how have seeds been today with the title in mind
Oop, gotta actually get going, rip. GL with the rest and may the second seed be not too too horrible lol
😏 Melody leads to the last stone, I am calling it
I'm assuming this is glitched sanity?
I didnn't know you could just fuckin clippy here. How terrible
anyone else exided for the ttyd remake
glad more people get to experience it but I'll probably be going without
I still got a workin wii/GC so I'm fine
There's been a lot of remakes lately and I'm just kinda sick of em tbh, like on the one hand people do get to play the game that didn't before but I'm also just like. Let devs rest and work on other games without that in between
WAIT HE JUST FUCKIN LEAVES WITH HIS GIFT LMAO???
That's like up there with Jr Jumping you at Kent C Koopa and he's just like ? ? ? Who is this sassy lost child
if all seeds are bad, whey do you have access to Flower Fields? /j
so ur avoiding the trick altogether
have you ever had a seed that was completable but you quit on?
What does snowstorm taste like? minty?
What do you need to full clear 1?
sorry if I’m asking too many questions
good evening @all you awesome people
also I’m doing another PM TTYD64 mod run but am doing the rando feature
I got MAYBE 4 hours of sleep
this monster rehab I downed before work is carrying me
I missed the heck out of you (I realize that I'm the one that has been away).
Fave character is seen on this holiday!
But yeah- How are things on your end?
@VikiHexen i was to focused on the gaming but i did see a tail wave
Well. I'm gonna be here still. I'm just gonna be a bit quiet. D&D game sessions happened earlier for a change, and now I'm brain fried. So, there's a high likelihood that I'm about to be wonderfully high.
Just go beat the game instead. Come on.
I'm still so upset that this trick exists.
It has nothing to do with the fact that I never knew that it existed until recent years. Nope.
Get him! Which one?? The not wh- You know what, I don't even think I want to finish saying even that much.
"I should have left as soon as I got a fish" sounds like it would be an online review.
it was the literal FIRST thing i heard LOL
Yeah, but it's been so long that I forget how, and then I got high~~
@VikiHexen LMAO this is a MOOD
I was gonna clean my room until I got high  I was gonna get up and find  the broom but then I got high  My room is still messed up  and I know why (why man?)  'Cause I got high  Because I got high  Because I got high
I'm in a good place now.
That Sushi color can only be described as pickled mustard.
Oh, you're into that, I see.
if its cursed i have probably made it exist somehow
do you want to add it
its just such a state of being, like life inconveniences you? phanto274Smile
can I offer you a mushroom in these trying times? phanto274Smile
Hii Phantom! How are you? phanto274Smile
i woke up at 12 30 after going to sleep at 4 am
got my first 21:xx prologue but died in jungle and then did a terrible blitz seed
oh right i thought it was checked off for some reason
not just because I forgot right side pink station\
@64papermario is this your favorite game?
what a nice guy he is phantomganesbot
maybe it's behind blue key lol
amazing just cuz partner upgrade blocks are shuffle
I never had any bp problems, since I just play casually Kappa
Also are you hyped for the nearing ttyd remake?
did you see that ttyd remastered got a release date?
hoping for more end game stuff
I never played TTYD so I definitely plan to pick up the remake
I wanna see more endgame stuff too
Like the smrpg treatment, with more superbosses after beating the story/bonetail
When did they announce the new stuff for SMRPG? That was also close to launch, right?
Ttyd is my fave gc game, even if TP is my favorite LoZ game
did you see there already a new switch emulator? LMAO
Yuzu wasn't the only one when it went down, doesn't surprise me too much
I might think about learning how to speedrun on ttyd remake too
If it is easily accessible and not heavily relying on super hard tricks and a ton of rng
100% needs a certain amount of amazee dayzees, that is a huge rng factor
Or I just enjoy the game casually
sub 3 15 is not bad for 7 ss
Just wanted to say i love your speedruns on youtube! Just caught your stream now but i enjoy watching your Paper Mario and Zelda Randomizers.
rd 2 we are a set!
and good luck even hitting it
Sounds like more fun the more you talk about it Kappa
I think I should just run a sonic game that does the glitching for me LUL
I think they will fix a bit of the General White hunt in the remake
i do really like ch4 and 5
They said something about QoL changes
Phantom is going to war with the speedrun com mods
hoping the palace skip is patch in the remake
Club64 is the most hip place in Toad Town
If you were the shop owner would you go complain to the dojo about the s*x noises?
can sNeeds really get bad tho?
I thought you were gonna say the ham knives bought
Jesse we have to cook them
I've always put whoever said the quotes as not to forget or to quote them later
Or if you were playing M&L RPGS just dodge or counter
So all chapters with 4x damage?
ugh who would vote for something like that 🙄
you know if you just had FeelingFine
4 damage block and 12 damage not block ok
what did nintendo do to mario voice?
sounds like he hit puberty or something
I saw miyamoto talking about another movie project and clicked off and went else where to see the reveals lol
so this sick new burrito place opened up by me
yea i was talkin to the dude who runs it
apparently he hand makes all the guac in the morning
oh man paper mario! i feel like TTYD was the better game but the OG is one of the games that got me into RPG's and will forever be special to me
well I hope you like stuff not being where it's supposed to!
okay i actually figured it out a while back phantom
TTYD has the best 1st play but replayability low
i respect it. i feel like nintendo should remake this one though over TTYD
i don't know why they're not remaking sticker star?
3ds shop closed? how to legally own it?
Well I'm going to sleep, gl on the rest of the run!
yea it's more doubled down on the writing, characters, humour, setting
It's wild to me how good this game still looks though considering it's over 20 years old now
foudn some good stuff on gamefly
can buy mario RPG and warioware move it for 65 bucks
i was gonna sleep on peach showtime, then I heard how made it
its really funny that the toad is scaming himself
I'm just in time to see the stream hit the six hour mark.
I just ordered the first volume of a manga I've wanted for a while off of Thriftbooks for an ALMOST reasonable asking price.
My brother made me play Wild Woody in Wisconsin and now I want to finish it out of spite
This was a high production Sega game and they couldn't program proper jump physics
The guy that did the soundtrack went on to be a part of the band Guns and Roses
Time to get cozy. Gonna chug the rest of this chichi's mararita cocktail.
Snugglin' in, if I fall asleep, so be it, but I'm gonna lurk.
that deserves a good ol ppdageGoomNUT
oh i am thinking about Bedge also but they almost done the seed
gonna be really funny if close call does something lol
peach got that coral blue #3 on
also @RavenFP  arlecchino coming next patch
Can almost do the run halfway through the month Kappa
I will not play genshin I will hold strong
I've seen, that doesn't mean I remember lol
next month are you talking about next speed game or for archipelago?
you can transform with midna in this state?
WooHoo a learning stream of a great masterpiece!
Yeah I can for a bit
Random staircases in zelda do that
Half the staircases in ww bonk and the other half dont lol
movement strats in the sand are so finnicky from what I've seen
Just light all the oil on fire
Yea this room was annoying af for alberto lol
top tier content: watching someone else KEKW
do most of these trick care over to wii?
Ive always played on wii, then I did do wiiU when that dropped. Never played on GCN but im wanting to change that soon
yes boomerang long jump does not work on wii
looks like wii version have Run on Magnetic Ceilings glitch
I need to replay this so I can follow along better
and snowpeak is first dungeon after master sword?
I hated the dungeon with the rod
not like you need it for the canoon to temple in the sky
If you wanna run this long term dot skip is useful
The map is follow the flute sounds
imagine being chased by naruto puppets
You're not alone on that brother
Everything relating tot I just loathe
And by that I mean I forgot
which secret moves do you get?
Although there's cool shit with backslice
im gonna assume thats the first one
are secret moves shuffled in rando pool?
I wasnt able to do that
my pc told me zelda speedruns is not a safe website
Yeah his tot runs is usually a clown show
KEKW but so is in every run
i had to click like 4 buttons to load it
Either you nail it all or fuck everything up
in any% its have a big skip Kappa
A lot of people hated cits casually, this was the one I fucking hated
The voice actor Brad Swaile did the voice for Light Yagami from Deathnote. He also did the voice of Megaman from the EXE anime. Battle Network 6 has EraseMan or if you go by his japanese name KillerMan or KiraMan is basically a shinigami net navi. It all comes full circle. Cheer100
that actually doesn't looks too bad
guess we need 3 days for rando SadgeBusiness
i think im gonna do a tp rando this week sometime
hey can someone explain the dungeon only concept? I just got here at the end of it and want to try
oh okay thank you :) was really curious
i always get this pandora Adge but sometimes in English and sometime in French HUH
Hey hey! Anni is actually my fiance and she saw me pull you up, and she's obsessed with everything TP related, Lol
I have been informed that I was told on about my obsession with TP...
Kakariko Village...the most quiet town compared to Ocarina
there is an easier way to do that with the cucco
you can go to the middle part, with the hookshot target
can you see in here lol
the worst cave ever...has all the items
my monitor is too dark so i cant see in here without lantern
you can scoop the chus with the lantern btw
i didn't wanna disrespect and mention it
holy shit i just realized you're using gamecube link!
love the drown as you surface scene ol
could always be somewhere in goron city for the shits and giggles
today was a first cycle day :(
Yo this guy has definitely done porn
I mean look at that stache
oh right the spam of A lol i forgot
Just found out Godzilla Minus One, a movie with a 15 million budgeet won best VFX at oscars. And this is the first time Godzilla ever got a nomination too
i've played this game so many times and never knew about half of these chests
do wallet upgrades have any logic behind them?
like if there is a check in a shop that cost 500 or something?
maybe tp will get price rando
this is def something on my mind id eventually like to try
the last time I did a bn3 rando I marked off all the BBS checks before I started LUL
as someone who randomized the oot skulltula token (100) i am good on poes
Just got confirmation the switch flashcart doesnt work for randomizers. That was the only reason I would even consider it.
nah skulltula are easy don't even use a tracker for them
even tho my 1st magic was on 1 and i forgot to check it and had to cheat and was never in logic until very late in my seed when i got double magic YEP
oh the cave of ordeals is for the wolf link amiibo KEKW
how many checks in those 50 floors?
wait don't you still need water bombs?
whats the additional data on the item wheel?
did you get the water bombs?
best part of TP is no bomb bowling LUL
bomb bowling...bomb bowling... BOOOOMB BOOOOOWWLIIIIING (hope anyone gets that reference)
Yo the boomerang long jump works in the wiiu version
no you were right next to it to your left
what 3 dungeons are you doing?
i was stuck in ad city...what were the dungeons?
does rando speed up iron boots?
so does the seed sttart with wooden sword?
hey, it was your first seed
if i try this rando i would re roll until 1 of my dungeon is not city in the sky
can't you drop it faster by switching to the rang?
i daylight saved my mornings now
do you think the Zelda movie is going to be based on one of the games or is it going to be its own thing
honestly gotta see this before i go to bed dude
ngl, I didn't not think you were gunna say, "I'm used to master sword with this" I was thinking of something completely different LOL
finish popped up on other lolz
Are you gonna skip the switch 2 cause switch 3 will be backwards compatible?
Weegee raid but I was already here LUL
what if Zelda was a dog
yeah, we were shitting on skyward sword KEKW
if i didn't like skyward sword, i wouldn't be streaming it
look at these n64 ass ground textures and trees
I reject your reality with my own
was just about to say @needaname37 lol
why cant gen 9 look this good?
gen 10 will be year 1 ps1 graphics lol
i don't remember. been a bit since i did 100% tp
Are your hearts.... BLACK LIKE MY SOUL??? -_\\
if your child became a furry after playing this game you may be entitled to compensation
i think once i'm done my playthrough of skyward sword, i'm gonna look into the rando for it
it's on a version 2.2.0 rn actually
most recent update was just in february
ye, i think they made it so it's fully open
anything in that chest? stream buffered and refreshed, the one before the grasshopper
DONT THROW THE BOMB AT EPONA PLS!!
how do you get up there!?
and when it does ill be here to point it out
are wallets progressive? imagine getting 5000 then it down grades to 500 lol
you can do the archery game thing now
were you able to map 3 weapons on wii?
been forever, i'm used to wii u
wii is dpad left, right, and B
wiiU had X Y and R
what does R do on gamecube?
you can also do the epic shield attack
yeah, looks like casually wii is the way to go
did you know if you put your sword away, your shield stops burning
it can only burn if its in your hand
skyward sword shield bash is surprisingly forgiving
it is nice when you dont have bombs lol
can you do the boomerang here?
next time you roll a seed can you like get snowpeek? k thanks
i think you can roll into them with iron boots too
i clipped straight through the floor there before
what was you saying about this dungeon KEKW
3 bows and havent found one SadgeCry
going to bed, thanks for the stream
perfect a 7 hour vod, 7 Hours of Daisy Noises LUL
and get your bow there right
i think the slingshot kills them?
glitchless rules are a little weird
its pretty much the same otherwise lol
i think jp is just the original ruleset
and the western one was made more recently
idk why they even made it tbh lol
i actually like glitchless dungeon rush a lot, because the dungeons are the best part of glitchless imo
i think most dungeons average around 20 min
so dungeon rush takes like 3 hours lol
It's a shame the only bk skip is in lakebed
do you know how to pull chains quicker
if you pull and then go neutral on the stick, it cancels the animation
i think getting the bk early in this dungeon is banned in glitchless but allowed in jp
i think you do thrusts for him
let me see what i did when i ran lmfao
i wanted bow so bad there
i learned by watching fx so i assume thats what he did
Fast travel ruined a generation of young men
True, first featured in the chicken statues in A link to the past
yeah i think thats weird too lol
big hint not in a dungeon Kappa
I already made the Suika game joke for this minigame didnt i huh
did you know you can talk to him as human felihePrideSit
i guess because hes a parrot
if you collect all watermelons do you reach 10k or just short?
This game map sure would be spiced up if you mirrored it. Is that an option in the rando????
I wonder why zelda would need to be right handed for some reason
and i told you not in a dungeon
im back from my eternal one minute and 30 seconds of ads prison
why is zelda going into the paper mario volcano
is he going to peach skip?
watch double clowshot be in lakebed temple
two annoying parts of zelda dungeons: keese,and keys
and you was about to do all of castle too
could be light sword in 1
in glitchless you kill these guys with bomb arrows
it should last the whole fight tbh lol
oh you have great spin felihePausers
i think great spin on this next phase is op
i think mortal draw is also good
drip is too good to randomize
do you know how to autospin
I assume you haven't learned Ganon yet
you gotta autospin after the jumpslashes
and thank you for iron boots finish
you spin the stick while in the air, and youll do a spin attack automatically when you land
idk why it works but lol
eat my ass I'm finally first
phantom does the resub message get the tts
I have an idea for my next rando redemption PAUSERS
I could redeem like 10 randos
so this is ur splits layout?
wonder if mine is broken now
mine is showing as 2 hyphens right now
i hope now, cause that dark box is ugly af
I could just put a warning every time cause I get the countdown lmao
YEa I get a countdown and a snooze button
Are you using the obs imbedded chat?
i mean not a big deal fix later
The obs imbedded chat doesn't function properly
I always go to my own channel and pop a chat there
I think it loads it as a "viewer" not as a "moderator"
Yeah but it's loading the chat client as you being a viewer
My mods have to tell me when ads are coming
I've thought about popping out my alt's chat client
Cause my alt gets every single ad pop up
Sorry, good days cost extra :(
Gamecube dpad is also just turbo ass shit
also twitch, stop highlighting the unfollow button!
You ever just fall off a bridge, and wake up with a full set of clothes and a sword?
I thought back in time was only in skyward sword
so you dont need to oob to get master sword early?
time to shar ein the pace pal channel KEKW
I have mixed about daylight savings. On one hand, I lose an hour of sleep. On the other, I get out of work earlier.
would you wanna wading through other people's waste if you walked through a sewer?
That exact statement right there was my Full feelings upon original release of this game, Lol
That absolutely needs to be a sound alert though. Would fit completely with all TP runs
i remember trying this glitch back on the wii and never got it once
i was pretty young when i try it so i didn't understand that you have to be in the right position and stuff
so what is in your opinion the best zelda?
tp rando! trying to learn it
I was looking up early GANON lmfao
can you do long jump into it?
where you able to get the clip?
beestPF_HF beestPF wonderful debut of this
I also have the guide for this game too, even still have the cloth map too
yeah the cloth shows the locations of everything like chests, bugs, heart pieces, ect
erm, 448 but close enouugh. my guide for platinum is 624 plus 2 sheets of stickers
I dont but I can look it up KEKW
when I bought the TP hard back guide, the scan bar was missing so when they rang it up they only had the price for the normal guide in their system so was able to save alot on that LUL
waht happens if you sink in water and try to switch to wolf link?
interesting, Link is just a shadow
i know i just want u to goof for longer stream.
I didnt enjoy my last weekly race but I may do it anyways
how's the woofer of time treating you?
so whats this cutscene skip? using the warp to bypass the cutscene?
so its a form of cutscene storage if I get my brain right from the likes of MM's respective tricks
fail to renember if this game was 60 or 30
so we're basically at double superguards
?sdrawkcab gnipyt draobyek ym si yhw
@Axl_SR taht htiw uoy tnac I 😅
I am meming mind you tippiLove its hilarious that that even is a thing twitch does randomly
I have hundo'd this game casually a couple times
but never went past this place much without the scent
however I renember there being voidouts haunted wasteland style
with other words: you skipped a whole lot of sidequest back'n forth which TP makes you do for this dungeon to be accessible
including spacing out arbiters ground not being needed before to not make that be a trip there needed?
up middle down (3 halfs, middle 2long, down up middle (3 halfs) down (2 long)
so going to reddit its been a thing for 2 years but it just happened to me starting a few weeks ago
for if you want it noted down icycaressLove
anyway makes sense given that partial cutscene skip / interrupt, that the flags for the area to load as needed for progression werent loaded proper
and up at the howling stone, you're then past the voidout zones
Hii Phantom! Good luck phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Smile
yea - have seen people mess with that jump, so far marked it off as "huh cool I dont want to" 😅
the rando for me just isnt quite there yet interest-wise given "layer" / "sphere" logic and the layer stuff kidna just not quite making as much sense to me as the spheres do (even if both try to represent onions)
like - had heard TPRando wanting to do sphere logic long whiles back, but havent ever seen it be there if that makes sense
I have seen a couple days ago that you were, but was in archipelago with frens so had to keep my brain there sadly 😅
with possible troubleshooting and other things
this being a thing which exists is still wild to me
its the first "proper" item 🤣
"walls are just illusions" holding true again when it comes to games
the best way of getting the ball&chain
this I reckon is some type of bonk to door or just jumping into the LZ if there is one?
the jump into the wall is diagonally into corner? that it?
so you recoil into the freezard?
oh gosh the momentum lock 🤣
if you stand behind the half wall thing, and don't stop while waiting for the freezards breath, it won't be directly facing you, which makes the trick much harder
so you see how it wasn't breathing at you when you were hidden
you're also not mashing to unfreeze faster, mashing A,B,X,Y,L,R or spinning the stick does unfreeze you faster (confirmed by decomp)
the vid I had sent earlier has you bonk diagonally away from the door into the corner to recoil into the freezard for freezing, then get pushed through and do the door bit if that helps any?
*curiosity given no clue on precision of tricks in this*
ah, sky's video is old, we don't approach from that angle anymore which doesn't change much but enough to be annoying
That is absolutely CURSED that he wouldn't throw that ball
fair that, just what I had found on a quick'n dumb search without much intel 😅
he needs to do a full spin to throw the ball and chain, this is why we roll behind him then roll back
the new angle I reckon has to do with either speed or precision of the trick I reckon then
snowpeak is a very fun IL NODDERS
yeah kinda, i climb to the second rung from the top and make sure i see him grab the rung then drop
cuz if he's not grabbing the rung then you can't regrab when you drop
andtpLove beestLove ghunzoLove andtpLoveHD hexspeLove HypeLove1 marcoLove minimi6Love popesLove spitle1Love tippiALove
they don't ever but the barrels can
you're kinda biasing away from the slab, parallel is optimal for speed but if you're off, bias towards the slab so you don't bonk
...still has to be roughly parallel to go anywhere tho
My brain has just shattered to where all i am doing is just watching this, Still hearing "F*king keese" while eating BK. Lol
ye, not many people run this cat, so if it was beest and you're not east coast it would be early since he used to start at like 8am est
i got note of another stream
So close to another keese moment there
so close to keese and the keys
She watched the two clips you did there, but especially the Gale boomerang clip
hey you know how to make sure he's thrown in one direction and not wherever the game says to?
i would try to toss him left and game is like "no he goes right"
risch was just explaining the frame we start on for BN2 aid said "style of element change" KEKW
so is sub 8 possible now?
deliaf dna "dliw" yas ot detpmetta I
@Axl_SR This was just happening to me! I think twitch is preparing their 4/1 troll
I don't know why it was doing it earlier
Another Sound Alert has been discovered
what makes that fight hard? its just clawshot and stabby stabby right?
Absolutely glorious 8:32 on a lakebed
this game has an air meter?
oh right, you get zora from the grave. Dont remember the sequence to get there tho
go to town. save the prince. get mom's approval and go to grave
so for a casual player it would be a softlock
Well it's a bunch of sequence breaks so
Can't wait for the inevitable Multiworld TP though
and i feel terrible for whenever someone makes it archipelago too
use to be able to play this song on piano...except not the left side
So I had an idea for my next rando redemption and I have a seed tentatively ready, will be a bit of a different process than normal if I do what I have planned though
I want to do a "blast from the past" using an old version of the rando to show how far it's come
Game decided it wanted to do a punishment in return for the gold split
I think the only questionable thing is ch8 which would technically be banned
omg we get to see stallord evo17Heart
i've timed it, i get bored very quickly
Okay cool, if that was a dealbreaker I was willing to jump ahead a little bit but I'll go ahead and send the patch in DMs later
the other ladder just before that is 6s
Take my points, seed in DMs shortly
Mario will try their best to drive us all bonkers
Did we just thrash a boss?
is there a way to just clip thru that door?
found it faster to shoot those things with 2 bomb arrows
callign it here, I went to bed early last night and now my schedule is messed up lol
he has some bomb ass music i swear
kind of was wondering what you were trying with the spinner
i never learned lost woods lol
i just hoped for the best
i think you go to the temple of time now?
ok i am making my return to the best dungeon. ToT
wheres cats when you need her
all because of one enemy here
how will you know the lore now
i know one of the gate skips
but the other one is harder lol
why can you only try that once?
allowed in glitchless even though its called analog glitch HmmCouncil
Are you gonna do the pixel perfect hookshot through the ceiling that saves like 6 seconds
so far this has been exactly like glitchless lol
oh theres a different skip for that in glitchless
you can get on the fence with clawshot and jumpslash over it
if barrier skip was ever found the tp community would make u a thousandairre no doubt.
he's a mini boss rather than a regular enemy
the ones you encounter in hyrule castle are just regular enemy
how does tp pause buffering work
no wonder i could never yolo the angle
i think if i learn a glitched tp run, it will be ams to start
step 1 get a dominion rod to kill spiders NOTED
sits right in the middle of the 2
don't send babies and we good
i think they are all big
at least the ones in oot and ww are big too lol
guess there gonna be spiders guts on my floor ah shit
i literally looked at the corner of my room one time and said to the spiders "only you 3...i'm killing what you're making"
"i let you live...you eat the bugs"
i'm the only survivor in tartt's stream
I played color splash for too long and pushed everyone away
that joke was funnier back then...sorry
ooooo this is the best catigory
idk ive never been able to speedrun this game but i have rando'd it
go back to the other side and by the jars with the rupees
so why do they call it LJ?
the fans don't like speedrunners lol
this long jump is allowed in glitchless
got it on the fly what a boss
the practice rom is all an illusion
I don't mean to be dramatic or anything, but I would rob a bank for that falcSmug plush
is that official like what it's so perfect
omg I think I found it this is the best day ever
What a trooper! Great first try
Feli, I would like to try your spoiler log bingo some day
hey. are all TP runs this long?
NOt bad from juyst playing through
This run can get to 4ish hours, if you work on it
oh no so u saw me in the vods chat then.
always missing beest dreams because im too degen SadgeCry
you should raid this Phantom5800 person
never seen this game I’m ready to be confused by all checks again
i seen that you have the same issue with rebirth that i do
but the game is still very good
currently grinding levels in castle crashes so this stream was perfect for passing the time
now you can play the game
feels weird seeing enemies that survive hits
@oakest5000 The snake gives me nightmares
well it is a snake so it’s to be expected
looks like an off brand Pokémon badge
what are those broken triforce coins for?
tried to randomize this game yesterday and got horribly lost lol
It's the first week all over again lol
at my event gl on rest of things
Some of their times have been approaching yours in the weeklies, haven't they?
why is that goron following you?
Then again, IDK who all will be playing
Yooo Phantom phanto274BLANKIES good luck! Hope you're having a good Saturday phanto274Smile
IDK if I will but maybe
Seeing a Goron just follow you like this is very funny
how dare he keep the cake away from the common folk
I forgot about those enemies so I was like 'why do they have bras on their heads' those are their ears,
this game is a pretty good randomizer imo
it's a lot more interesting the alttp imo
I forgot this boss is literally just Fancy Turtonator
Less dungeons means more out of world checks too in fairness, less dependency on dungeons in some ways
alttp doesn't have nearly as much variety to checks
That's also why I like MM over OOT I think
WW is also nice in that sense (race settings, only 6 dungeons) but everything's a little TOO spread out
I am no expert to alltp but i end up making the randomizer settings cranked to the max or else it's kind of just a different path compared to vanilla
I coulda sub 3'd the last seed I did easily I imagine
I'm tempted to learn some speed tech but IDK if I could do super swim. At the least Swift Sail helps a bit
I have heard storage is a good trick to learn at the least
i'm not a fan of any of the 3d zelda randomizers so far /shrug
Seed bleed is real and can hurt you
i get bad seed bleed in balatro
sometimes my lack of memory is a good thing for seeds LOL
has a lot of little things that require a lot of items
why is minish cap a speedrun but twilight princess is a randomizer
I never remember this when I do WWR, relatable
2006 was such a 🔥 year for gaming and kid me was renting the wii version of twilight princess to play through in a few days.
I think a dependency on the tracker also slows me down for WWR, I don't have to use one for MMR
having a wii in 06? how was impossible to find
I think it may have been 2007 instead
as a kid I was comfortably late to new video games
i had the gamecube version didn't get a wii until 08
It's me, I'm comfortably late to video games now
The Wii was my first console and I bought it circa 2008
i got my wii December 2011, after skyward sword came out lol
i got zelda tp and super paper mario with my wii
Don't actually remember but I know I saved up and bought it with my own money as a kid
first thing I got with my own money that I remember was Pokemon Stadium 2
my mom and dad bought the wii for me for xmas
I think I got the Wii Sports+Play+2 controllers bundle
But then all my other games were gifts
I know I got Gamecube for Christmas, but I forget about the wii
i remember my dad bought the gamecube in 01 with resident evil remake and luigi's mansion
I got weegee, Smash, pikmin and... there was another game
i still have my OG Luigi's Mansion copy
I sold mine like a fool
i was too scared to play resident evil 1 but i could play 2 and 3 with no problem
I remember that Sonic Adventure 2 Battle was my 5th game
i know i had the other pokemon game not sure if i owned the 1st one
I still have most of my GC games
but I wish I still had SFA and Weegee
I kind of wish I could get my hands on Cubivore
i wish sometime the game would do a funny and you get half a red rupee or smth
that is called a yellow rupee, my friend
@fatpidgeybirb yes but it would be funny if it showed half a red instead
That'd be some Mr Krabs nonsense tbh
ayo??? Goin for birb first thing??
hopefully not plummished (punished? Get it?)
true as a birb I wish a very violins on Plumm
The zoomies betrayed you yet again
you can skip those and have enough tbh
i think the highest score ive gotten was like 50k lmfao
you avoid the watermelon very carefully
are the free standing rupees om the ground also rando?
hey remember when you did this room and it was the worst for like, 5 whole rupees?
are you still using my settings catsittingverycomfortablecute
im glad they have been good feliheHappy
dont worry i try to get him to do tp and mm rando
not using the cool shield still SadgeCry
just put your sword away 5Head
will this be another swordless seed?
ah yes, I remember how effective that sword was in the Sky Temple boss
wait a min is snowpeek 1 of the dungeons this seed?
i made a seed so i think ill do it tomorrow felihePrideSit
its been a couple months lol
all these enemies are like nahh
yo phantom how goes the rando
snowpeak is a great dungeon, unless you're playing it
yeah i would think everything i like about the dungeon disappears in rando context
Get you a Yeti that looks at you the way Yeto looks at Yeta.
i have plenty of bad ideas for a solution
problems created by a funny solution require funny solutions
I assume dungeon learning went well?
This is one of the only Zelda games I have NOT finished
dear rando, that is a rude place to put that item
hows it going Phantom? I was just watching on youtube, nice to see you got the ball and chain in this run
no wolf tho huh that kinda stinks...
I think this is my favorite Zelda
its this or ocarina but this a better game I just grew up playing Ocarina
I feel like seer odds should mean something should be in it
purple link looks pretty good imo
at least you can't run out of bombs
poe, more like pos, am I right?
a bottle and a bag, not too mauch
now why was that not in one of the hundred chests in that lake hylia cave?
maybe they were fishing for those sand worm jerks
Phantom, I have something for you at Mixfest
also, h'ullo chat, streamer and YouTube
the 1st one, you're gonna murder me for
the 2nd is to apologize for this 1st gift
wait you got both in the same room?
do you still do paper mario speed runs
wonder what the vanilla item is there
she did say who’s heart did you catch
the actual game should be like that! that looks so fun
thats a nice improvement for rando
just check yes it was a heart piece
do you need to beat all dungeons in this game like in Pape?
jeez the chicken people are weird
FLOATING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
I really need to play this game again
this one of the Zelda's I had the most fun with
even if it was the wii
like hot take I know, people you can all be mad, but I like this much much better than OOT
that is exactly my argument and always has been LOL
@ohheyitjaye we don't trust people who say OOT is still the best 3D Zelda
i had a save so was able to recover but its something you should know
not me i like oot better
dang, sucks to be you blacktiger :)
(it ain't BotW nor TotK, but it sure as SHIT ain't OOT)
top 3 zelda games alttp oot mm
I completely kid though blacktiger. you like what you like PrideLaugh
but ALttP and MM are both super solid entries
I just like how dark and ominous this game is. That's what caught my attention a lot
only over 6 hours late Raven
You've had that on the entire time
so I had Briney take me to Slayport, no surf, no bike, no devon goods, I took the ferry to lilycove and over there I whited out. So when I took the ferry back Briney wasnt at slayport anymore. So just dont white out and youre good
I won kof phantom are you proud
I was wondering if those flame arrows would instakill you at Goblin Camp
also, you need to add this phantom:
version 2 has a warp to home in pause menu so it wont be an issue once that goes public
that was almost more satisfying lol
oh, are the mirror shards locked behind bosses only or no?
but yeah, my seed was awful. I had to go to fortree without surf lol
i also spilled water all over my desk, luckily only post-its got ruined
remember when master sword was in kakariko LUL
good thing theres 2 master swords
oh wow that is noticeably quicker
are the boots just like that or are there progressive boots to make them faster?
how does Link's tunic flip inside out when he is upside down?
when asking that I struggled to remember what links clothes were called LUL
that think is like game destroying
Since you started this seed how many miiverrse stickers have you found? KEKW
i remember getting upset when a chest was just a sticker
Link dies in agony from the lava but this slab of rock bounces around like Super Mario
do you consider anything after gen 5 as retro gaming?
I heard someone say "if it doesnt connect to a modern display its retro" and I could see that argument
wii sint retro cause you can play it on wiiU LUL
someone saying PS3 is 18 years old this year so its retro. "yup, what could be more retro than watching a movie on bluray?" LUL
I leave for a second and suddenly ganondorf
dude throws around Goron without gauntlets or power bracelets
and that's before the iron ball
I'm raiding my Bedge so raid whoever
Finally not working Sunday lol. Haven't been able to see one of the PM randos live for a while
Do I have to cringe in advance? I don't think I'll be able to handle this lol
how do you gen the old seed?
I got really confused for a second there lol. Grabbing key items without checking Summit. Then remembered you said 7 spirits, which needs all key items >.>
Should be mostly the race settings at the time but I think I may have also put on coinsanity
looking at the RPG games list and see archipelago with BN3, emerald, OoT, and KH2 with an ETA of 3 hours. Okay then, good luck with that one guys LUL
I went to look for mario RPG and found BN first lol
Now watch P Rush be 7 BP
But it IS a koopa! Just with wings
that was the most normal looking shop ever
interesting how spike has the slowest time for RPG
You seem to get Chapter 7 scaled 1 a lot lol
I read that as chpater 7 scaled to 1 LUL
I watch your VODs on youtube and they give me hours of entertainment, so I figure it's the least I can do. Thanks!
you can do your panels now lol
marathon? Is that snes and switch back to back?
with so many submissions for RPG would be cool if limit break made it a race
we gonna see shrink strats on tubba heart phanto274Pog
went to fill water bottle, anything good after blooper?
sorry i missed the beginning, is this glitchless?
oh right, in the OG you werent able to toss items
and out of logic, no watt no bow
OG Rando didn't have cutscene skips, so that'll be fun
twitch won't let me use my prime sub, wtf
at least they did since the last time I used my prime
Portillos has a mint chocolate shake now and it's really fucking good
Forced reverse ch2 with Lyrics in Mt. Rugged is a little cursed
It's "until supplies last" but maybe it'll be here next month still
I beg your pardon. Tohru is best
@gyroguy123 Fair argument but nuh uh.
i never knew he had a name
i want to saute the pink fish
reminded the krispy kreme has green glazed donuts for St Patricks Day coming up
can confirm they are green inside too LUL
new bell flower tech incoming wtf
yes, you can throw bombette on that and bomb block for jumpless
i was gonna say itd be easier to line up the bombette shot but you need to jump anyway lol
so there are 3 blocks you can do that with for bombette
I suggest u try Bombay/Jack Daniels mix with cranberry orange juice if u want it flavored.
with no extra badges or boot upgrades how much does megajump do?
Cause Power Jump does 3 in prologue
so its the same boost as super/mega quake
someone in emerald AP found a shiny tentacruel lol
that’s the only key besides the tuba castle keys that looks like effort was put into the design
Snorlax the premier pokemon and gomamon!
Help the poor Goomba! He's scared of heights and can't get down!
Im shiny hunting in black and white
Im trying to do a full shiny playthrough
And I say that as someone that loves one piece
Ill let you know when Im done in 10 years
Didn't you take Power Rush off?
When the shiny chances were higher btw
Still a chance she could be here
Also Axl I saw you trying to put copy pastas in Marss' chat when he was streaming pape
oh $600 is in the prize pool for 2024 Pokémon FRLG Any% Glitchless Tournament
1st $300 2nd $180 3rd $60 and top tourny time $60
I want to learn that trick
Don't you have Yellow Berry though?
Also I got and have been playing through a hat in time
tthe rules have that trick with parakarry. Is it easier with him?
Parakarry in front of fence in Lily room
I was thinking of the fence by yellow flower
so yellow flower fence skip isnt listed
Been meaning to ask, but what's up with the emote cycling in the bottom right?
I do like staircase skip letting us skip the koopa fight
Cake Mix was in Daisy Tree before Lily, I think
boots opening 7 would be nice
how do you mash power shock?
my best isnt good enough phanto274Cry
Ive never even reach max on fuzzipede
he's got that new turbo thumb
I'm gonna go grab something to eat. Will be back in a few minutes. Don't break the game
yo ultraboots! That means ch3 is next KEKW
maybe you're just particularly in sync with the game's mojo
Alright, actually going to get food now. Like I said, don't break the game
oh right no odd key, I had to think about that one lol
Did Mario just walk into the chest
or we swap to monado and watch BACKTRACKING THE GAME
Alright I'm back. Find anything cool?
also you dont need to fight supeer
you also need goombario… he’s on the tracker
interesting thing I noticed today. In the lastest One Piece there was a flash back with Luffy's father. He was voiced by the same guy that voiced Kakashi in naruto
What would happen to a key item that gets trapped in the Merl whatever room?
Would you be locked out of the seed?
are you just looking for dirt now?
Oh wait hes crystals not ice
Dang, no dirt in the whole jungle?
About how long is left in the seed? 15-20 minutes?
Just wanna know if I have time to run out and grab pizza lol
Before the next one that is
Guess I'd better run then lol
Had to leave for a bit but am back now
Good luck with Troopa and Bowsers. I'll try to be back either before next seed starts or before you get too far in it
Missed most of this seed but in time for the special one
I suppose it was in fact a baby seed
plus you did get the water stone
Bring up the old non-compact tracker?
I think open ch6 might have been an option but it's not on
i got st patricks donuts so im ready now
Not the oldest public version but very close
have fun fighting goomba king LUL
@Icebound777 did you see what version this is?
I did. That goes back pretty far
I actually forgot text speed was changed lol
Could be worse. Could be one of the alpha seeds
oh no, it's forward fill NotLikeThis
It's the first version with assumed fill
I didn't grab the oldest public version
I mean, assumed fill took a few months, even after the website went up, if I recall correctly
I only started watching about 14 months ago. I'm in for a treat
The better way to place items in a randomizer
Surprisingly, this is from May 2022, so only ~2 months after public release
Oh, really? Ampharos and Cheeze got fed up with forward fill that quickly, huh
Peach castle key? Will that be needed?
well, traps werent a thing yet
I mean, besides the obvious text speed and cutscenes, thing shouldn't be terribly different I guess
This is still in "we need the weight" land, and the gear is vanilla, but besides that
The better times, where we had 10+ people races
its funny seeing bombette hop away
get more than 1 bombette LUL
thought partners had dialogue added to avoid those kinds of situations
Not sure tbh. But I think you couldve left using Parakarry to get into the LZ
So this run is a reduced QOL seed?
Fun fact: these Merlow changes are the main reason I actually went back to the old version.
And this is another 7 Spirit seed?
Almost everything else is still a setting
like if you did a 4 chapter seed all the chapters wopuld still be in logic
Logic for old Merlow was enough Star Pieces to buy everything, 60 iirc
Well of course, now that you've said that
I think we did already have a setting to have ch6 open, but no choice for how many seeds
I was against 2 seeds but I changed my mind quickly lol
I think Koot favors weren't a thing yet, and maybe the dojo wasn't either?
jaye, welcome to a 0.10.0 seed
just been paperLurk on the second rando now?
I crashed the game somehow BOOMIES
thats cool tho, hope you've been doing well!
if you view the cutscene again you can skip it with B, its vanilla
Dude I would love to speedrun TP I've been watching thru commentated Any% and hundo runs and it looks so cool
Do the coins on the spin-y flowers randomize?
does that tree not have 2 checks?
@Axl_SR You used to have to reload the room to get both
I wonder if this was before we made yellow yoshi vanilla again
TP is an oldie but a goodie and also cursed at all times
if chocolate cookie is made from chocolate is yoshi cookie made from yoshi? phanto274Thonk
Sadly I don't have the patience to watch a TP Rando
Isn't there multiple hundreds of checks?
Which means you can beat ch4 YEP
ice listed the Ram loctions so that covers all the checks right?
so you talley that up for the total check out
It's like around 650 or so, IIRC
coin bushes try me up but I dont play that enough
lttp without any bonkers, made-up settings like pot shuffle is 216 checks
did we get anymore mario pallets since this version?
I only know that because there's a podcast named after that number
Star point loss on run is enabled?
The RAM doc lists 707 item checks ... that's more than I expected
my seed in the multiworld was 239 without hidden items
berry bushs ads like another 80
Worth noting this version did not logically require 4th Ruins Key for ch2 completion
What, no "Hi Goombario"? Tattle is totally free!
@Icebound777 does that include shuffling upgrade blocks?
can you toss items in this?
crazy. that was originally implemented for the online co-op MarioMan announced
they did sell a mystery so Id assume you cant throw items
That was a thing long before I got involved
It was a thing, but clover set up the item toss and the mario pawns for multiplayer back then. You're just the first to make use of it
how many castle/prsion keys are there?
Were all of the Castle Keys required for shortened ch8? I don't remember
never upgrade hp if hp plus badges only cost 1 bp Kappa
playing a randomizer is probably a ton of fun, bute I got way too much stuff to play
also I'd rather play a ttyd randomizer I guess
Oh god that's right, Bowser's Castle isn't skipped
interesting, I expected mouser to come out of the shop
also I think Reed is dropping the next demo version of ttyd hero mode tomorrow
or day after tomorrow in your time zone I guess
interesting, the rando went public in march 2022 and I did my first seed in May but didnt go seriously until Sept
Good thing that block was always 10 hits in rando :)
this is just funny to me... "Getting caught by Sentinels in Tubba Blubba's Castle while riding Lakilester softlocks the game (vanilla bug)"
Yeah shuffled gear is probably the single most impactful rando change besides maybe the switch to assumed fill
What are the odds this is the "rare" sewer boots first seed?
Need Laki, Pulse Stone and another Ruins Key
Often very important yet sometimes not required
Great, now you guys have me scrolling through ancient git logs lol
ice, bring back Alpha Test Modifications - All shop items cost only one coin or one starpiece KEKW
oh? the item toss was apart of alpha 2
I found a commit of mine on a test branch for progressive gear, from april 22. Don't think we had that done until, like, August
My first commit to the repo was in May '21, crazy
Didn't realize Full Gear Shuffle was that long ago whoa
Guess it doesn't help that races continued to use vanilla for a while
and Jcog reset on the letter only to hhave to do it again LUL
Thank goodness for closed ch7, LCL and minimal cutscenes since that original release
I dont think anyone will forget that seed
I was so proud I finished it cause I had just started rando
having ch7 open and having to bomb the lake lol
Making 7 later was also a bit contentious at the time
ah yes i love getting scam text messages
That was largely with Big Chest Shuffle, yeah?
yeah finding boots in volcano is awful
I do see we are beating 5 first as per the tradition of the time
does no healing items include life shroom?
Kent used to be 100 coins!?
IIRC 100 is vanilla Kent cost
The whale can now be opened with the Ultra Boots. I guess they added super boots later?
Are you looking through the old change logs axl? lol
Yeah, Pronyo changed the whale to allow for the ultra boots to work
omg i never knew this "Title Screen: It is now possible to toggle the game's music by pressing the L button on the file selection screen."
I didn't know that was a thing
I dont have anything mapped to L on my controller
Some people like having other music on stream
I think m4 used it for a while
so does it just turn off the music?
I mean, the vanilla music (un-shuffled) is fine IMO. And it's not like we have custom music import
The dk64 rando scene is crazy about random music. It's nuts
You can make your own custom music packs and stuff
I might try my hand at making that custom music if it existed here
I've thought about downloading some kinda music software and fuckin' around
Wait did this version even have the in-game tracker?
The best part of dk64 custom music is that you have the voice bits from the dk rap as midi notes
I wouldnt know what the start and commissioning music is a huge no-no
yes this has ingame tracker, I saw it on the channel log
This version fore sure doesn't have the map, dunno about the key item tracker
interesting homeward shroom was a toggle
You were going to but either got something good or remembered something and turned around
this build was the one to add fire and maker mario
ngl, for how much we've added to this rando over the years, this really doesn't look all that different
Fixed issues with item pouches: Anti-Guy not taking the lemon candy and Tayce T. not removing the right item from Mario's inventory. KEKW
Oh, but that camera issues during the Kooper scene is still in today's version! .....
okay so I started playing the version released after this one
I don't remember when I first played but I watched even a little bit of the forward fill days
do you not have ultra stone?
Starting Ultra Stone wasn't a common thing until Blitz
ngl, kinda refreshing to see cutscenes again
So maybe we find it and maybe we don't
Fixed a bug where the Koopa Village radio would keep playing when exiting with the Homeward Shroom, later causing a crash when growing the beanstalk in Flower Fields. LUL
I definitely remember having that crash and then once it was figured out what caused it, everyone had to avoid HS from that room for a while
It even affected that jp practice ROM, so we forwarded how to fix it
what was "vanilla softlock that could happen when blowing up the jail wall in Koopa Bros Fortress"?
Maybe there weren't a lot of situations you'd HS from there but you didn't have to be in the house
@Axl_SR Where Bombette gets stuck on Mario during a ctuscene
oh, I never actually saw that one
I mean you could have also needed to backtrack for something in the shop if coins were low at the start
We've had it happen to people in races once or twice, that was stressful
this text feels so slow lol
this is an accurate representation of my state of being blobComfy
Adam this seed is 0.10.0 so May 2022
why are you doing this to yourself
Me? I wish I could play this
I thought this might be interesting
@Axl_SR I saw your DM, we can work something out if you have an idea what settings you want
We see anything yet that was better in the old days, which we could implement again?
@Icebound777 I think the only major thing that's not still an option is the Merlow changes
Which IDK how people feel about them
Uh, hm. I don't think that'll happen, since the patch overwrites a big part of Merlow's menu setup in assembly
gotcha, ill hit you up about that later
I like how all the seeds are rotated differently so you knoow which one to mark
Having Merlow implemented twice, with a toggle between the menu implementations, is a clover-level change. You'd have to get him on board
Yeah I knew there were reasons for changing Merlow globally even if not everyone liked the decision
Random pitch is such a bizarre function. Same as roman numerals
I know M4 used roman numerals
For roman numerals clover was like "lol I had this patch for it lying around from my latin patch 'Marius Papyrus'"
dnag, no testing the softlock FeelsBadMan
Is it actually fixed? I heard people were still getting it
I heard something like "it happens less, it's not only frame perfect"
Really? Smack on Huff is such a specific set of circumstances
You only crash on huff if Bow only smacks him once, and only if that kills him
For realsies though, is randomizing Yakkey a good idea or not
why not it will be fun to randomized yakkey
@blacktiger51 It makes all of Tubba's Castle potentially useless
ramdomizer yakkey could work in AP tho
Randomized Yakkey is like the only thing similar to a zelda boss key, but without actually having to enter the dungeon
YO WE GONNA SEE SUPER BOOTS IN TUNNELS
Been watching TV with the fam, what's this seed all about?
Randomized Yakkey could maybe make more sense if you fought Tubba in his room
also randomized star spirits will be really funny but the devs don't want to do it Sadge
Eh, I'm over being against that one, blacktiger
If the player finds it funny to buy 6 star spirits in a toad town shop, then I'm like sure, whatever
so you might do it? widehypeE
What won me over was the comparison to Metroid Prime artifacts
That also sounds like the kind of thing that would be better in an AP setting
so would rowf be on spirits collected of bosses fought?
It'll also turn each chapter boss into 2 checks which isn't that great
yeah would make each boss like fighing lantern ghost
Spirit itself as mcguffin for endgame, and the star power increase
No idea axl, I haven't thought that far lol
that would incentize doing the fights for sure
Would those make sense to be decoupled without level upgrades also being random?
Though first got get the random puzzles thing released, and I'm cookin' up two experimental settings
@MarioManTAW Level upgrades? You mean the star power order?
you fell thru the floor panel?
@Icebound777 I was talking HP/FP/BP levels
I don't really think of the SP upgrades as being separate things from the spirits currently
I can't follow where you're coming from on this, MarioMan. But I don't mind turning level ups into items, as long as we force no xp
you know that a good idea
@Icebound777 Or you could do what some games do and also make level-ups checks YEP
We don't have battle logic, so we can't really make level ups into logical checks. And yeah, the high level ones would suck so badly
i would be down to try it
Considering that is a suggestion on the discord, there has to be at least one person
It could be acceptable with a limit to the level for checks
I went to Minnesota and found Spongebob's eggs
Even if we have a logical limit, you might lock good badges on high levels, effectively deleting them
i wouldn't want anything pass level 10
Also I went into a McDonalds and saw that Multiversus promotion. Nobody inside knew that Multiversus was supposed to be a game
All I know is that I had some WcNuggets yesterday
If the marketing team is trying to kill this game they're doing a great job
Hasn't Multiversus been out for quite some time? Do people still play?
They closed it during open beta
i played it when it 1st come out for about 2 hours bad game
But people still got to buy microtransactions before they killed the servers :D
Hrm. I mean, it worked for FF14, so ...
you usually force ppl to pay for your characters in betas right
Yeah the microtransactions was not ok
my friend bought the founders pack for that KEKW
but why would WB games do that
it's okay, WB's more than happy to take even more of your money
the dumb multipart cutscene with the guy nobody is sure how to pronounce the name of
I wanted it tossed the othjer way LUL
Overall my thoughts are thank god Rivals 2 is dropping the same year as Multiversus
@SeventyFourTG And garou is next year and we replace both of them
That would be a lot of chapter clears to get done in an hour
[mountain climber from price is right]
@RavenFP if you wanna help me learn garou next year I'll be down
pc crashed D: during mystery dungeon
Okay I've been checking the logs occasionally, this seed is definitely more cursed than I originally thought LUL
she and i are supposed to race eventually
The first version of star points dropping didn't actually have a check against overflows. So that was fun
remembers a seed paperario did, he entered 6 and got go mode with 3 chapters to clear at once lol
so far 0.14.0 had my favorite update FAVORITE BADGES
ok ur under aresst for apple abuse
remember bombing yellow blocks and having to reload the room LUL
wait does this trick work in rando at all?
but no star stone skip Sadge
it doesn't work in Bombette puzzle though
Not quite correct, the Kooper puzzle skip was found by MrCheeze
do we have english item duping yet tho? For literally no benefit
There are two ideas for what causes item duping, but haven't been tested yet
You can seed dupe for non-key items YEP
surprised he didnt heal at the end
Presumably if he's healing more than once it's expected to be a very slow fight to begin with
whats the trigger for him to heal?
Still better than gen 1 Pokemon
Dunno what's more rude. That the weight showed up this late, or that it bothered to show up at all
Guess I could have made the pred last longer but phanto274Shrug
id use that time to give pupper head pats axlsrPat
3 hours and still 3 carrds left phanto274D
Is that the first Cake Mix we've seen?
do you just need bean and a fortress key?
I saw one much earlier too
Oh but still ch6 logically required for cake?
Yeah Frying Pan does nothing in this version
cook without frying pan was 0.14.0
Yeah, looks like 2 cake mixes, both in 6
Well I'm probably going to stay lurking but thank you for streaming today! I forgot to take my meds the last couple days and you're honestly my fave streamer so thank you for helping me through a bad mental health day <3
what do you think of pape rando adding in random critical hits?
sure and why not have badges that increase that chance?
of course enemies could do crits too
But the thing Pape players love about Pape is the relative lack of meaningful RNG
how much HP did Laki have?
I think there was an option to not cap XP but I left the cap on
And Laki was capped back then
New twilight princess family member raid.
Also why is ur vid on 180 lock?
why are PayPal and Venmo different when they're the same damn company
they are both bad but what can you do
you don't have Zelle, do you?
first Ive ever heard of venmo
I venmo my barber funny things as tip
paypal was made by elon so just think about that
Ooh! Should I Zelle you the money for MWSF? I prefer Zelle cuz the transfer is instant
Zelle is superior I will admit
I've heard lotta issues about PayPal, but I'm lucky enough to not have experienced any of them
so what settings is this can u skip straight to bowser?
3 10 and still need 1 item
and people asking to auto swap to parakarry to deliver letters. Id slap them thru my monitor if I could!!
are there any parakarry checks you skipped?
1 item from go mode and I know where it is
oh right 2 checks back here
Lemon was in a Toad Town shop
Unfortunately I'll be going to bed soon so I won't get to see ch8
So what all do you know you have left?
that would be gross if key was there
this is so weird how im locked outta ur video
it 1080 locked ghunzors stream las week as well. makes zero sense. Twitch I am a Gosh Damn sub.
Okay I gotta phanto274Sleep but phanto274GL with the rest of the seed
gn @MarioManTAW keep up with the great work on multiplayer!
fave character and i see him buffering
would be dope to add multiworld pape to the monthly stuff
what did you use for a controller?
I use the switch adapter for gamecube controllers on my Mac
im also using my wireless GC controller of 19 years
I have the one that came with smash wiiU. I keep it in the same drawer with my switch dock
amazed at how its still doing amazing
I was telling Raven about when PM was hot, you could order the white JP GCN controllers off Amazon for $20 a pop
The white ones are OEM yeah
well i guess imma gonna bounce. this feed is so not cool and fair. GL on the finish.
But then all the smash players wanted them
I had a white smash WiiU one but got rid of the shell
@Axl_SR all I can confirm is, the JP whites were before those cheap ones they made for Smash 4 / Ultimate
Shame Panda didn't get to release the Panda controller
was VERY much looking forward to that
that was removed cause thee koopa couldnt be targetted?
7 enemies on screen at ones LUL
but Panda going under was good for the scene (citation needed)
fuck people who were making careers outta their passion, we gonna stay grassroots (ie, broke)

Mario decides to be a proper arch-nemesis and storm the castle instead of flying to the last hallway
"These walls ain't SHIT" - Bombette
you can item dupe in this?
i like having them change to bombette then megashock to just kill them lol
4 hours to reach jr, holy crap
i fell asleep during a pikasprey stream and woke up to this
pikasprey was streaming cpu only mario party 1
we should've left this in the bin, where it belongs
did twink do 10 at once?
surprised I stayed for the whole 7 hours lol
9.5 hours away 1000 hours of rando! phanto274ColonD
yeah phantom5800 is streaming pape Kappa
You shouldve saved this for 1000 hours
I had errands, but then I decided I ain't doing shit cuz downing a monster rehab + 2 red bulls to stay awake during a 6-hour drive has taken its toll on me
if friends leave food behind, it's free real estate
gotta get creative with all that pasta
someone once left cheesecake in my fridge. I was ESTATIC
maybe if you wanted to induce illness, you could've held onto all that
nah bro you should’ve kept it, meat ages like wine bro phanto274Smile
well I got peanut mnms and gummy skittles so I’m prepared to watch in full
i like the milk choc m&m the best
m&m tier: pb > crispy > chocolate > peanut
wait, "gummy" skittles? that's a thing?
gummy skittles are pretty good but regular is better
shuffle has a sense of humor to throw on Luigi's Mansion music for this area
I remember chocolate skittles being a thing. I recall them being awful
Skittles: wild berry > regular > sour
that's all the flavors I remember / care about
that looks like a pain in the ass
who up snowboardin with they fish tonight lol
whomever decided TP needed snowboarding, I hope they got the raise they deserved
He doin his best, he has no thumbs
This Puppet Ganon fight looks weird
.... why does she remind me of Melony ? ? ?
I peeked in btw, any reason you went down the longer path for the speedrun while iceboarding
nods, I always forget about it until it's too late myself
ok but actually that must be tough keeping your balance with a weighted fish in your other hand on one foot
Good cook, can iceboard on one foot while holding a fish he caught for his wife
claps me hands. My video is renderin about Renpy. Tonight I LEARN

oh, this game is just broken huh
I do love how you just fuckin take the item of the slain enemy in this. Wish more Zelda games did that
they clearly not gonna use it any more, might as well uwu
why is the 4for4 an emote
imagine if dude brushing Link aside could kill
it's just after the tiny forest
it was 1 away from being quote 69
@RavenFP how do you always find me at my lowest
@buff00n why are you always there
You're the one who bathed in the cuck tub on your own volition
Bonking on doors you're standing on is the classic 3d zelda experience
I'm so glad ice ring is just 1 island and there's no other shit like that I gotta deal with
every seed I do not have to go to Ice Ring is a blessed seed
wait you can grab shit with that LOL
That should break the fucking container
Let all the heart juice spill out
Nothing is more powerful than the power of LOVE, Raven, don't you know?
yea there is more powerful things and one of them is a 1000 pound ball
Oh boy am I finally free of rendering hell? Can I move along to upload hell?
tbh I'd pay to see regular Link wrassle Pig Ganon in the final fight as much as I adore Midna doing it
wait I just noticed the pin lmfao
I love that I scrolled back and was afforded no extra context minus the bot
Please help I have terrible diarrhea
I didn't even get to see the second message. Damb
IS THIS THE CONTEXT OF THE PIN?
I was playing MK8DX, there was someone with the name "AnalQueen"
I got a W, so I said [pinned comment]
Not true! I think he is full of whimsy and I enjoy him as a character! but fuck the puppets and as a mechanic
ToT is good and you know it's good because it's like Tater ToT
oh I didn't notice but the medallion is a motif here, that's a nice touch
beest told me a way to do this without the cs
no video but i can make a clip because i did it in my rando yesterday
i think youre gonna get a good time in ad pretty quick
looks like you got better at dark nuts
I feel like these darknuts are the scariest because they're the most humanoid
the way they throw teir sword at you is kinda badass as well
Yeah they get rid of big smashy and pull out a lithe one
having two swords is 300% guaranteed to be badass
(or maybe that's just the inner sword lesbian talking)
its almost as cool as switching hands mid fight like in princess bride
you should watch how i do this room as well
it didnt seem too precise tbh
alrighty thx for the segments gonna bounce then.
the temple of space and time felihePausers
my us one was $90 i think
and then my aunt gave me another one she just had
so i have 2 now lol
You should've been like hey buy my new graphics card and put it on a shelf and put it on store credit
A game store in Vegas? Do they have the Konami pachinko machines?
some collision in this game is so weird
let's do the bomb boost againnnnn~
i kinda want to run tp more
i think ill learn ams and then ad after that
you start on a file after lakebed i think
i did a very interesting thing with that gate in rando yesterday lol
now the timing does seem a bit precise
i think thats why people use bomb arrows here
so you dont have to aim really lol
This is awkward to come in to
Oh thank God I skipped it
marcoGL beestGLGLGL phazon3GL phanto274GL majinGlad marcoGL_HF
this is the earliest I've gotten outta work in a while
no lie kinda wish u did this fight so ur going for the target.
my fave found clip in this game btw
try watching the video at half speed?
It's only there when you move it fast 🥴
the failure joke on it is DeadPixel.
it honestly should be with a moving aggerok flying off ur hookshot line.
came here from your YouTube video actually
how long does the intro take to get the seed going?
I saw you doing goats lol
sure, might as well ask for it now
btw did you see my question in discord?
i looked at romhacking to see if there were any QoL mods like mapping midna to D pad so you can map a third item but all I saw was a spanish translation.
i dont remember the shadow crystal
oh, i didnt know that had a name
i was mostly curious if there was a better way to play vanilla
I always favored the wii version
I look back fondly on the waggle, wonder how I feel about it now
I would imagine id rather waggle on a couch and not a desk tho. Never played the GCN version so that will be a trip
whats the 5 circles on the bottom of the tracker?
is this really gonna be a quick tp rando?
and forest lakebed and snowpeak are required? Do you pick the dungeons when you gen your settings?
also I made my yalm for next month
and by made, I just took someone elses and changed a few things lul
DKC3, turned on KONGsanity, all kong letters per stage make a check LUL
did they stream it on discord or something?
I know a few other things but ill let you go in blind lol
I can only do it if its a rom, I dont do PC stuff so that means like no hallow knight from me
might get prime next month so i will join for the next 1
what puts that bow in logic?
so yesterday my controller for pape started left stick drift, so today I removed the trigger plugs to add them to a smash ulimate gamecube controller
that was one I got used recently for around 30 bucks
I wonder if rando added that?
i been looking at getting a ssd for my ps5
there a extra slot to be another 1
yeah, I did that awhile back
take off the sides then there 1 screw
how much of snowpeak can you do without chain?
i learned you can collect the bugs with the ball and chain btw
i found a 1tb on amazon for 100 bucks
i think i got my 1 tb ssd for like 50
dang the price has gone up since i got it
says i paid $52 but its $75 now
i had to delete granblue and i wasn't done it with due to space
I got a 2 TB for my PS5, best says I spent $200 but i dont remember spending that much
Maybe I did but I know there was a huge discount when I got it
its fine, you hhave a slingshot KEKW
I need to get around to finish playing this game. I got frustrated in a spot in the water temple as a kid and never ended up finishing it
I only had trouble with sky temple as a kid but I finished the game rather quickly
I think there was a part you needed to Clawshot across and I couldn't seem to get it.
I'll get my notebook out for lake temple NOTED
knwo what I like about this game? its not open world
you should try using my hookshot anything cheat next rando felihePausers
i can send you the file if you want
and there's actual items n' crap to mess around with
sounds like double clawshot turns you into SpiderMan
I would be surprised if double clawshot was a bug while developing the game and theyre like, "this is really cool and fun! Lets add it and make puzzles around it" LUL
@Axl_SR that's how Double Cherry wound up becoming a thing in 3D World
I will play tears when nintendo releases their next console and there is nothing to play on it lol
i will probably never play it
I at least got it used from gamefly so if I dont like it the 70 bucks ddoesnt burn me too bad
I was told TotK was more of BotW and knew I wouldn't be into it
i used store credit from gamestop
basically got it for free tbh
ngl, it's cool af that you still get the discount
i also bought a wii game from gamestop at the same time
"alright homie, I tried being reasonable"

last night I tried an extreme async. Gave up around 4 hours, my progression was block on the ground in desert cause the seed had static mirror

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside And I take deep breath and get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs What's going on?

"Revolution" Man, remember when the Wii was called THAT ? ? ?
I remember the first issue nintendo power revealed smash melee. There was a screen of pokemon stadium and I legit thought we were getting a stage from a space station LUL
got accepted as a volunteer for MWSF. Sweet
okay, forgot how fine the Zora lady was
she left you her son's allowance
video games have taught me to try a lot of things before I'd knock 'em
for pape multi do you connect the same way as AP with bizhawk lua?
so its open lakebed then cus otherwise boulder in front?
kinda how "open forest" for OoT if not on would turn every seed as child start into "get sword, shield, sling first"
if its not magic, dins / bombs
so hear me out - you know pokemon emerald right
AP has it available for key items rando, and within a 3 seed world (5 peeps total, 2 beginners, the group I did it with had the 2 co-op with 1 of the seeds respectively while a 5th person did their own settings)
you know routes 132 to 134? yea we had items for EVERY seed on every respective seeds set of that
plus shoal cave and other stupid shenaniganry
and one of the seeds (the one I played with someone) the other person dug out after we had beta features bike to fallabor from rustboro (not yet on the poptracker) plus free fly to fortree to get the last badge to fight norman for devon goods via reversing the S.S. ticket ride from lilicove
to then use the bikes as mentioned earlier alongside using the bikes elsewhere while waiting for surf PrideLaugh
man i must have impeccable timing the last three TP seeds ive tuned into late your always in lakebed lol hows the seed going tonight
last bit was dealing wit mossdeep team magma for go-goggles from stevens dive HM check to get the rain badge from the sandstorm routes
wow lol i wish you could just get the master sword in a small chest in vanilla xD
I had to do that in my last one too
I was excited at first cause learning new logic but fuck that
or with other words: "good ol rando logic" KEKW
id be down for doing a race with you two
the best bit for me personally: every emerald rando seed I so far did was some backwards routing (interesting for learning) to the point where I now just expect it and an easy seed would be hilariously "Huh" to me KEKW
the first I tried was free fly locale to fallabor, use that to get devon goods from jagged pass I think? to go slateport vanilla ways to get strength for magma hideout to finally get rocksmash access I think
no need to explain why that's fuky
like - love the logic kerfuffles
but definitely a roughy to learn if you hadnt had any rando experience before
@Jonxhas btw if you take Briney to slayport then tidal to lilycove, if you white out and take tidal back to slayport Briney will be gone. I got softlocked once LUL
sorry if I sound dumb, who to where?
my brain's not deep enough yet for character names in emerald to make sense much past "whos may, who's wally, gym leader names"
briney is the old fella with the wingull?
Briney is the sea captain that takes you to dewford and tidal is the ship from slayport and lilycove
ok - briney didnt make sense to me
WEIRD though that the white out after S.S. tidal resets the briney locale
only thing i remember about emerald is norman is your dad
also makes me not regret setting "fly without badge" and "start with fly" via starting items in emerald rando PrideLaugh
however, when version 2 goes public the pause menu has a "warp to lab"
cus that makes you not able to lock that way anyhoo
@Axl_SR definitely sounds good as an option
my favorite new feature is berry trees added to the pool, I think I remember hearing it ads 88 checks to the pool
well they surely cant be on route 132 item 1 PrideLaugh
as long as there's no AP tie in for this it would be yea PrideLaugh
cant tell ya that, not versed enough in this game - that being said by looks, maybe from atop the chest?
but looked promising distance wise for sure
lantern sounds to me like it if at all could be a "if keys in dungeon but shuffled maybe" sorta thing rly
iron boots spinner sound like they stink a lot
oh come to think ManChicken - is that one now a per dungeon item or lets you pick'n choose the dungeon you last were in FW style?
those man chicken things are cursed
so it auto-updates itself in a way rather then acting like a FW got it
my brain was just like say "entered lakebed, picked ManChicken + used it, entered goron mine, did the same" into being able to warp to respective dungeon if you set it then left?
I think like with cuccos, uccos?
my bad, but still would guess that'd be the way for it
that one Harrison Ford mean. Cuccos: baby boy. baby ooccos: evil
yaaaay bottle with fairy tears 🤣
meanwhile my internet decided to have its blip right when you froze into game over so I was like "huh" for a sec KEKW
"wdym its hard to see in this dark cave" asked the person with the miners helmet
inb4 irons or spinner here to KEKW
go into the dark cave to get item to help with dark caves
oh I know there's a couple where its dark in this PrideLaugh
even if I might not have seen every inch of TP, searching for the poes rather then consulting google first made me find quite a lot of doodads
oh the triple poe cave here?
yea last I member its expected cus its pitchblack in here
I'd assume so unless it got changed - heard about this cave a year ago ish in regards to lantern
and given there's a small tightrope segment in here, I'd not be surprised
like - bets one could be skilled enough to do it lantern-less
but also like - thats worse then ALTTPR dark room movement to me
fair - over here its just pitchblack truly unless there's effects going on
i cant see shit on twitch side KEKW
so like damage effects as an example
so an owl statue chest got it
how do I know this KEKW
KEKW "sorry ManChicken I just needed to see the interior here for a sec"
yea burns is open last I know
says so in his letter he sends you Kappa
have you ever taken your lantern out while in there
oh isnt this the "hookshot rail down from above" chest
if only you could clawshot anything
I played this game too much vanilla without glitches
so whats needed to beat the game in this? still needed to beat up zant in twili realm then fused shadow for barrier or....?
just curious cus last I renember hearing about this game was "layer" rather then "sphere" logic (meaning say 1st sword cant be past where you get it vanilla) and something about the fused shadow / mirror pieces to not be easily shuffle able
which the latter one kinda sounded like the OoT blue warp shenaniganry truly
definitely need to look at this game's rando a bit again
last I tried it was with an internal cheat system to set up which was superbly painful to get working correctly in the first place so to say my interest havin been softened woulda been an understatement as much as I do like this zelda for its overall darker theme a good bit
was like a year or so ago that I had looked into this rando so not surprised if there's been changes since
SadgeBusiness have to do open world stuff on ff7 rebirth now
has to be sphere logic then KEKW
cus NO WAY would spinner have been possible here on layer logic aka "cant be past vanilla story segments of arbiters"
yea last I recall hearing about this sphere logic / assumed fill shenaniganry was just not yet there
@Jonxhas yeah tp rando used to suck until they added it lol
@Feli_Heli basically why I didnt look at it aside of the cheat view lookin install you had to do before PrideLaugh
which - come to think - does this now have a patchfile system?
the hero of twili - unable to pull sword for someone glued it into the sheath PrideLaugh
btw i dont think you should use wolf to attack him
clearly ganon drank phantoms fairy tears
i think if you do 2 with human, and then turn human after the wolf part, it only takes 3 cycles
time to do another rando right
liking what ive seen so far
prob gonna edit the layout tho, I like verticle layouts more myself
verticle (plural verticles) An axis or hinge; a turning point.
wow... dont count on dungeon room shuffle happening for a while phanto274Smile
in discord or something for this seed?
yeah, icebound just dropped an update in dev-general
oh so i cant toggle the bugs if i redeem a seed
the checks list is shit to read on mobile
it would be fine if you could know what she gave beforehand
out on errands u got this. will be back though
is this gonna be a “fast” one?
my next redeem is either gonna be daddy or bitch
wgats under the blanket? it looks red
racing the guys with rando puzzles, ill be back after that. GL

Megan is so fucking broken she's the best one
Literally a normal tts will be used and she breaks down by the end of it
the rod is a useless item
its less useless then ice arrow in oot
Listen I think rod is also pretty much useless but damn when something required is beneath it
I hardly ever hear about ice arrows in oot lmao
You can kill Ganon now :)
When both progressive swords are in Zelda castle
whats more useless then rod and ice arrow in any zelda?
I like how the stick is more valuable than the slingshot
I just got this game cause you made it look so fun
less good with motion controls but still great game
the flip has goten me more than once
I despise this dungeon with a passion

What a nightmarish color scheme Link is sporting.
how long do randos take for tp usually?
Hallo, I am here from playing around on the new vr
i havent seen that trick before thas neat
any% don't get the bow anymore?
ahh last any% run i seen they get the bow
yeah ball and chain then leave
Oh what happened in the first one?
oh no axl is gonna torture chamber
the seed is season 1, minimal cutscenes, random puzzles
Hii Phantom, how's the rando so far? phanto274Smile
Link with red hair is badass
Fun fact i had mine like that for 4 weeks.
The only real selfy though with the style was when i went to a park with my late pet.
More randos = more content. Kappa
So not only content, it's a lot of content and their BIG.
unless they me popesEyes_HF majinEYES VoteYea popesEyes_SG majinLOOK
Time to catch a BIG fish
Are the wolf songs random too?
it was super fun. I’m excited for this new puzzle setting
I thiink there is a jank way for that?
kinda using the slpe portion of the fence cus of the height diff in collision
just use clawshot anything to throw it in and then go up there 5Head
just super jank if it works, dont count on me being right on this one PrideLaugh
why are you using the spinner to kill them?
that is such a gross location for that
"it's just me you little shit"
gonna hold onto that seed for another week. I dont wanna miss MarioMan's multiplayer seed on sunday.
that chest is super annoying after the water is on
especially if you get it with a full wallet
i walked up n the railing
The game is willing to give you everything before giving you progress
imagine doing a BN5 rando and the first soul you get is medi soul LUL
what? you dont keep your milk in an ice chest?
last night I played your 5000 checks and went to bed, woke up and there were still 90 minutes left LUL
reminds me of persona 5 speedruns, going to bed after kamoshida and waking up to the end of futaba's palace
you did it for the fans
I saw you on TikTok today!
I’ve just been getting into streaming and I think maybe it just got into my algorithm? because this is the game I’ve been streaming lately.
it’s my favorite out of the franchise for sure
Tp is definitely a good game
I love that trick you just walk past
This fucking goober has better development than anything in totk
Sounds like you got some glitch hunting to do
just bomb hover oh wait wrong Zelda game
oh wow! you do really long streams
I do like an hour or two and then I’m burnt out 🥲
the only reason I remember you is because the little ghost guy. I remember that logo from TikTok and I was like “omg it’s him!”
hey guess what u don't need double clawshot
looks like they skip both rooms
he does have 2 but only use 1
i can see both the tricks being useful if barrier skip is ever found
ohh so you don't need to bomb boost there another way
do you need Hylian shield to beat the game?
beast Ganon music is very interesting
Imagine being the dark lord, and you just watch this elf boy just run around you and jump slash your back
time for seed number 3 Kappa
but i just got here D:
Nice finish on the rando spear 8 was nuts. See ya on saturday then enjoy the break.
I was here but Twitch scammed me Madge
marioman i had to refresh to hit  1st
You in for PMR multiplayer tomorrow? PAUSERS
I mean, you don't /need/ to
Well lucky for you I have random puzzles on the proposed settings for both seeds :)
i would play it 1 day
I just had to leave for the toilet to take uh
And I came back and I'm a Lugia!
Bless you for being able to stand the slow battles. I just can't except play on 4x speed
But that's like 10 seconds of wait just to hit run
Counted - 9s from initial stop to being able to select run
Hey, Are you going to pace?
Yeah looks rough. Though that's usually the case with your seeds
I've yet to try a shopsanity. Mind you I haven't done a rando in ages.
Yeah the rust sets in quickly
Oh no I come in during everyone's favourite dungeon
Yeah, not like it's water pulse which can confuse enemies, it can only lower their speed.
I tried to gen an AP pape seed but failed so switched to prime rando while kiyuki trouble shooted that. We got a seed gen but decided to hop off for food then come back for that later.
do you have any interest in prime rando?
I played rremastered with a gamecube controller lol
gotcha, dual analog never clicked with me
dang, someoen redeemed first already phanto274D
Everyone saying they need to practice LCL for league but its not like you need to race day 1 lol Like you could wait like 2 weeks in for your first race lol
Wait that might have been a vanilla rare candy though
Know that ttyd hero mode chaper 2 is out now
Im at hooktails castle in the game
i got my vaccine and i was high, then i got my booster now im confident. im asexual mr phantom5800
You might even be able to find a Magikarp 👀
We can't fly but I can swim phanto274ColonD
At what point do you just make yourself start with Fly?
I mean even if you start with the HM and have to find the badge, that's an improvement, right?
Yeah, both R/B and Emerald have that in AP
But also R/B is small enough that not being able to fly isn't that awful
UGH, I WOULD BE AT WORK DURING CRYSTAL RANDO
early fly is the friends we made along the way :)
I'd do Crystal, even if I don't know squat about it
I'm 1000% positive that child buff00n thought "Metal Coat" was a coat / jacket made out of metal
this area feels like a BN undernet LUL
Time to get into Mt Mortar phanto274Smile
Haven't played BN2's but FUCK BN4 Undernet
doesn't help that 4's Undernet music SUCKS
Bn5 undernet: HOPE YOU WANTED LIBAERATIONS 3 TIMES LARGER!!
I'm excited to see you beat this without every finding fly Kappa
@axl_sr realizing I cuz cheese the last Liberation Mission in the bonus area via save-scumming cuz I had ProtoMan and Medi was a Godsend
what did crystal add to GS?
Don't forget the most important part: animated sprites
omgg Octo is holding a controller phanto274Pog
when do we get the completed dex rando
even battleship seeds don't get close to completed dex's, and those take a while
Lance wishes he could have that many Dragonites
its like how my sm64 pb vods get hit on private because of the end theme getting claimed by some randoms
last time i check false copyright claim is a crime and nothing ever happened
Oh right, I remember that NiceSoftlock
People will literally do anything to grift
Okay what 10 year old made the moveset for this charmander
hey sorry i dipped immediately but if I didn't go to the bathroom I'm pretty sure I was going to die on the spot
I hope you're having a great stream
That charmander was actually supposed to be in little cup before you showed up
petition to pronounce HM as “him”
Aah I see.. how u been dude hope ur well
Just came from Japan like yesterday
From what I've seen of other people playing it, it reminds me a bit of Kirby Forgotten Land
Yeah I posted most of the pics in Facebook since Twitter only allows me to post 4 pics unless I make a new sweet unfortunately
It seems like that same kind of "games for non-gamers"
And I know Kirby tries to have some stuff for experienced players, not sure how Peach compares in that aspect
Imagine being able to travel YEP
The one time I left the country I was young enough to not need a passport
I think I fixed my SMRPG delay
My super jumps don't feel like 10 frames delayed
Blocks are pressed right when the attack collide now
And the toad assist is actually on the last frame of the golden mushroom as opposed to the very first frame
The only blocks I'm worried about now, is Punchi, since his block is awkward as hell
And I have no save file to test it
You gotta remember, I'm used to 10 frames delay lmao
Can I just bike your ass?
2 runs of derusting for me got me a 2:44:51, which is 11s within my PB
My most recent run had a freebie croaka, and I kept it
And it came in handy for smithy 2 cause he went early mage
I got a chance to use both lol
That's one of the reasons I just violently shred my wrists mashing
Cause I don't wanna run turbo
I don't want my runs to just get overshadowed by non-turbo runs
Yeah, but the turbo board for normal is dead lol
I just wish they'd have an actual conversation around turbo
The only downside to turbo is the need for a non-standard controller
Oh darn i missed a rando and looks like a whole stream
and i guess for a good reason 2
ur video is 1080 720 locked.
Based crystal rando chads on a saturday night
That's where I left my squirt bottle
hey what's the rock type you cn find in this cave on vanilla
Bro just ran an ad after the joke I just made
the yo mama one wasn't enough for it
God why is the spritz bomb counter so late LOL
Wait I think this may just be a regular twitch ad idk
I need to get myself TWITCH PRIME to SUB!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dId I miss any rhinocerous during that 2 minutes
Don't worry I can make similar jokes if you encounter a fire slug
When did your channel get below the low quality settings threshold my internet is struggling to watch this 1080p60 beauty
I can see the umbreon plush in the background clearly if I fullscreen
I'm just going to ignore the D*gimon ones to your left
Hate that random anime you download in the wild is x265 nowadays
my nintendo wii can't play that
someone forgot to paint that magnemite
Spiderman meme before one is obliterated by surf
When I was a kid I just casually walked into each of these statues and fought the rocket grunts at each one
Almost 2 levels from Blissey 👀
Wait where are the animations when pokemon get sent out?
I wonder what my boy Ho-oh will be
Not Fly being the hangup again NotLikeThis
Wait you already have the HM?
Fisher Mark the Psychic gym leader NODDERS
Does the seed just pull from followers for some of the randomized names or how does that work?
Wait I haven't seen enough crystal rando, it just changes the gym type and limits the pool of pokemon it can roll on the trainers? That's hypeE
nah but on the real tho phantom the covid shot gets updated and i didnt know, it's like game patches
Just found out the network drivers on my PC were outdated by 9 years
My PC is a hand me down from my brother so I guess I should've been checking for this kind of stuff
It's made by the people that do those EZ Flash GBA carts
what's interesting about it is that their new DS cart has a FPGA chip that does nothing
I think some of these emotes should die
I hated this as a kid
thanks for stream! have a good night phanto274Smile
3 hours of sleep a monster energy drink
yeah I totally broke bizhawk lol
also before mine look over the random puzzle changes
so youre streaming for 10,5 hours?
"Blitz will be less than 2 hours for sure"
last week I did a blitz in 2:00:40
Weren't the 4 star blitz seeds longer than 2 hours for a while?
I will wait until the 20 minute mark
Goombario start. This should be good
im at 37K and if I lose that knocks me further from another seed redeem lol
I was reminded today why I dont emulate games lol
so I may have to sit out on the next multiworld
if I couldve just used 2.8 it wouldve been fine
I have been testting out the AP genned seeds tho
there was an outpost crash, just entering it would crash lol
It's been 5 minutes. Where's the new partner? Kappa Kappa
the 3 locations that normally contain dusty hammer, dried shroom, and dried pasta not being able to be shuffled before, so they weren't even included in the data... thats fixed now but I ran into another bug today lol
I started with hammer, but hammer proxy 1 wasnt removed, so when I entered the loading zone next to blue house it crashed cause storeeroom was anotherr hammer upgrade
Is this chapter 7 again? xD
I must be remembering wrong. What hp is 7?
Not like you need Bow for this chapter anyways
maybe goombario is good this seed?
Would be cool if Raphael gave the Karry of Para
well if it only 1K im not dropping 20K lol
I'm sticking to my guns. Something fucky is gonna happen and I'll win!
Power Jump is your last chance
"you should check this badge" "you should check your letters" *stalling for time so I win the prediction* KEKW
marcoGL phazon3GL phanto274GL beestGLGLGL majinGlad marcoGL_HF
have you done anything out of logic?
the AP seed I did yesterday whacka had ultra shrooms so I farmed those and cooked with 10 coin maple syrup. key items in shops were 50 coins each lol
Feeling Fine 100 star pieces KEKW
cool, I figured out the bizhawk thing but I sent you my seed already so sticking around for that
It was as simple as select open GL in the display method tab
so for multiplayer does marioman need to host it for now or can anyone do it?
got real lucky this seed finding so many badges this early
aww i just noticed the Gomamon and Augumon in the background. <3
i woud sup reiht now when i hat the money for that <3 digimon
yep. i found a Gomamon funko pop at GS but cant find the others
I see Gatomon. The ears make it easy lol
i want to find a Piedmon
the updated digimon cards are so juicy.
they are still making digimon cards?
i have like 6 secret rares
i havent seen any since early 2000
only TCG i learned was yugi-oh and pokemon
@Vixey_Lycan it's a new digimon card game, separate from the 2000 one
ooo ima have to look into that
yeah so I got controls to work but cant move diagonally
i  think make it fast go to next seed this see is close to over
Lorcana is such a neat game with crad looks but the over hemmorhage the prices of my fave character episode/movie clips. like yeah i can afford it but make it make sense.
I cant even do that lol
i have a idea for chanel points the fx sounds from pm
i have starte again with monster hunter jeserday 20h in 2 days XD
yeah, im not playing pape with a d pad lol
im excited for 30 minutes of 1st cycle again
yeah i think a good exit time after song of healing/deku mask is high or mid 26, idr
never seen a run for that
how long is glich less  going
slight feeling spike is in here
bruh you just shimmy on the ladder and it works lmfao
i have seen on yt a low% stream from a speedrun twitch chanel but skipt the waiting part of the run they startet the run to the point and then go to sleep they keep the stream running hole time over nieht
you completed 3 chapters before they completed 3 chapters lol
What scaling was this chapter anyways?
20 minutes! Come on Jr! You can win this!
How does the bot even work anyways?
i got ice crream and heard my name
I meant where does it get its data lol
its wild how the bot follows japanese runners
mayby my curs englich helps well XD
Jr managed to waste some time. 13 minutes to beat both Bowsers
that spammer was so strong my net died for a minute or so
Come on, Bowser! You got this!
Bowserr Bowser he's our man, if he cant stop phantom then no one can. GO BOWSER!!
I'm late, are you doing another after this?
Bowser, just stall for 10 minutes! YOU GOT THIS!
I like the sound of that
Yooo i made it just in time for the end phanto274BLANKIES
Yes Bowser! Keep using Fire and Shields!
2 Repels. Used one on Jr
convenient maple syrup for back up as well
big guy isnt playing around this time
noooo!! got a 6 ad. gonna miss the end
Course Bowser had to be like this
stupid ads... made me miss the end. im back...
subscribe like and comment so he can make money
I gtg sadly. Gotta do some stuff around the house
you already know which one I want LUL
Don't think we can hear the audio from it anyways
Not that I could tell anyways
I just see it pop up on the webcam
naw i couldnt hear it either
i ahve a seed wher i nee to beaat bloober 1 only with jump 1 no partner is fun
try being a decent person instead of being a pleb
Wait it's the same guy who got bonked?
I PAID YOU MONEY THAT MEANS I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO WATCH YOUR STREAM
thank for the money you stay outside anyway
also i once banned someone and they sent an unban request that said "i don't want to be unbanned but [passive aggressive negativity bullshit]"
it is season 1, i think prologue is open?
@Mirby_Studios then dont sa somthink hi and gl and done close the chat
who would be the 3rd partner found?
well anything like that is unfair for me lol
ooo how long to find gombario
@Axl_SR you got this just ideas
What if both are in the same shop?
this was the first random puzzle seed and I raced marioman and levias with this
is it first to reach ultra?
First to reach Ultra isn't bad
walk in 1st shop 2 hammers
We shall see what Axl has in store
Wow just gonna leave him to suffocate in that carpet roll?
any rools that th see had to have
well, komari was running that metroidvania love live game
The bot gets a plus from me for mentioning Touhou, but I don't get the rest of it
Anime girls who fly and shoot magical bullets at each other
you love a little out of logic last stand
...........I SUDDENLY GET THE CONCEPT OF RANDOM PUZZLES
imagine if pow block flipped spike goomba and his head got stuck in the ground
can't wait for you to try mutliplayer
but when he have nothing you dont ned to get star pices at all
Merlow can't have progression either way, right?
marioman just had us pilot some stuff out
adam, ive most got my trouble shooting solved but not completely
axl you actually made phantom play this seed, wow
I'll think of something, I guess
hell bent on not buying goombario LUL
ok i match the Gamba 8500 vs 8500
i say nothing "but nwhat  ad"
Funnily enough, but I think I heard your phone go off, but not the donation sound from your monitor lol
Maybe it was in my house above me then
I have my setup in the basement
ok i go to sleep gn all and i hope on ultra hammer
is it optimal to do that check now or last?
Now watch them all cost an arm and a leg to equip
and to be in logic you need 20 available
Phantom I think your channel points are bugged I am very clearly here first but it is not letting me redeem it
I will know if my lonely ass team won the splatfest soon
None of my friends playing picked it and my q times were really long for finding teams
its like that letter was in the mailbag or something phanto274Thonk
my favorite head canon was M4's seed had parakarry stuffed in the mailbag LUL
if I gambled "everyone copy Axl!!" KEKW
Logig says me you get normel Game Hammer before Boots that why i Go with hammer
Alright, I am actually gonna head off now. Delayed stuff too long
my superr blooper took 3 attempts
why this thing got 10 billion health
Good thing mario has 10 billion swag
how does a lemon grow on a coconut tree?
in this seed it just happened to be vanilla item locations for the shop. Levais was able to guess it lol
I didnt bother guess cause cake is 20 coins
yeah, koot just tells you all 4 items
like it has the 4 blocks and you click the order that they are?
oh gotcha like how we can make dungeon shuffle
when marioman came here he didnt have parakarry, he got trolled so hard KEKW
is the star element also in ttyd?
in this game its just shooting star, star storm, and monstar right?
I impulse bought a hottub today
nice, now impulse buy one for me too
I got it for a STEAL too
frying pan cookbook cakemix and lemon now
is it cause the room curves?
if they remade this game I wont if they would still have the rooms curve
i mean would they remake it if they remade TTYD? they kind of skipped over it lol
its wild how long the first chapter took
I dont think so, its already on switch
that whole direct was full of remakes/ports and their "one more thing" was another remake being ttyd. Id be lying if I said I wasnt salty
i was excited for it tbh. its one of my all time fav games lol looks amazing to
i can agree on that. i think i poured hours into the first playthrough then couldnt do it again haha
hey if they somehow randomize the glitz pit this time around that would be siiick
i went over a decade without playing ttyd, but the game was memorable I still remember what happened that it ruined my recent revisit
i still remember the whole game but i think it'll be worth playing again with the remake for sure
yeah, ill play it but im in no rush
first chapter clear at 1:30 lol
im getting a physical copy of ttyd
im waiting to get a gamefly used copy of ttyd
my switch is modded so i can turn my physical into a digital
and no one wants to watch you do that KEKW
speaking of shrink stomp, my merlow had it for 75 star pieces
and i believe ruins stones has 60 combinations
oh, i was think 5 slots and 3 stones lol
with outpost if it has a bunch of key items/badge it wouldnt be that hard to guess it
funny how phase 2 is easier than phase 1
so in today's news, apparently the mega man x2 manga is what led to kohei horikoshi wanting to become a mangaka since he loved drawing crystal snail. so crystal snail is directly responsible for my hero academia.
so the multi seed is at 1:15 and they have 3 cards. Not that it matters they are doing power starr
@Mirby_Studios It was also the Movie Sky High that made him choose the genre.
oh they only need 3 more powerr stars
slight correct, apparently he never specifically said manga so he could've been talking about the game itself
in which case, good taste horikoshi. that stage theme is a BANGER
@Mirby_Studios Yeah everything is reversed like flame boy being the son of 2 heroes instead of the movie villain. Dekus main friend controlling Bombs instead of Strongholds friend Controlling earth/plants.
then again he also loves FF9 so he's already known as a man of culture
4 with p up d down?
marioman finished with a 1:20 with 5 others helping
Second seed was a 1:20 with almost-allsanity
I didn't get to see most of them but the Laki one definitely threw me off for a sec
notice we dont have goombario LUL
what do you think of shuffling the flowers at the gates?
I don't know what all counts, most of them are just game knowledge that turns into brute force or finding the logic item but the Laki puzzle is actually somewhat of a puzzle for the first time since vanilla
In ch6 with the rising and falling platforms
I got there in the first seed and was like, wait a minute...
it wasnt vanilla, you did have to go back to the left side
I'm not sure how much it was/can be changed though
*you didnt* you only stomped on the right side
It broke my brain but I probably had a "less-complete" version while you may have had a "more complete" version
so just kooper, bean, and lunar stone?
so like if youre at 20HP, blocked fire does 19 to put you in peril?
Oh uh autotracking had several issues but my emotracker also isn't wanting to let me upgrade the pack so I don't know if it's just outdated
Any idea why it would act like it was updating then still say update available?
I don't know if I updated with your changes ever
then you will never be first again
i will never redeem it again
@blacktiger51 Then I might have a chance again YEP
hurry up and stream 59 more times so I can be first again
Kay, I just deleted what I had so I could reinstall and it seems happy now. May still need to confirm if anything's actually broken.
Yeah, checkmarks and stars were broken. Gear also seemed broken which was weird
It was bc it was still trying to use my old version
In any case, those should be fixed unless there's an actual problem with gear or something
I might want to get with you at some point to see if we can talk to the Everdrive at all
yeah, it was on the beach lol
since wario land fell off its nice seeing games like pizza tower and anton blast pick it back up
i just now heard anton blast
the prior "anton" game was a Mario Bros x Breakout game
like bn or one step from eden?
who's stream was this? I'mm check the vod
eden missing the over world stuff is why I skipped it
@buff00n it shouldnt be hard to find, he streams weekly now
the most recent vods are BN and Duelists of Eden
unless risch didn't change the category?
oh I saw him playing that so I thought you werre talking about that lol
Eden isn't pretty enough like BN to warrant my interest
yes, that's very petty of me, I know
but you like black pit LUL
black pit's a good excuse to get drunk
it looks turn based? almost like mario RPG
structured, fulfilling experiences with rougelike modes / mods >>> rougelikes
this trailer I saw didnt have any grids
as much as I liked Hades, I'd like it much more if it wasn't rougelike
you made this seed look easy. The rest of us struggled hard lol
from what I'm seeing of the trailer, it's turn-based but you dodge / counter enemy attacks on a BN style grid
we all bought goombario for blooper lol
speaking of open world i have to do more on ff7 rebirth  SadgeBusiness
yeah I bought goombario and it kinda helped
someone i watch raided him and i was like cool
ive got my raid message ready
damn i was late and still got it KEKW
@blacktiger51 i am so pumped my fave game is being touched for a run.
still dont understand why that trick works
@stalkor in lore wise it may have our equipment down the cavern.
do you think Link is a fan of Limp Bizkit?
tp is a bit too big to run only a single month. what do you think?
oh no youre gonna run pacman
we def vibing to the best wolfie
s&s = shite and suck skip
okie dokie back to the boulder we go
oh you just gotta clip in
wonder if the lja is easier
oh do you not have it rn
Yeah, need boomerang for LJA haha
i see that you are currently on the forest temple split lol
You also can't fullscreen the video
Is it up right while Z target?
For more information, please visit: http://zelda.speedruns.com/tp/msb/ear... :)
It could be a slight up right
Just to keep link moving forward a bit
I think he's facing at an angle when he z targets
maybe you just want an angle where link is facing the crack directly
it looks like they also Dash the moment they gain control of the wolf
tbh zsr page says you can just walk through
Phantom is allysons ham still in the fridge
Jesse has just claimed to never waste meat
we have yogurt in the house best before April 28 its bad
eat food in house nah get TacoBell yes nice
hey streamer, good luck on runs
recently got into pm64 randomizer and found your channel, but i'll gladly watch twilight princess too
yeah I just had a seed that took me like 4 hours but I've also only been doing them for two weeks so I don't even know if that's good or not
yeah it was 7 stars, the season 1 settings I think?
I just load it to S1 on the generator
so I think I might try TTYD rando next
in spirit of the release thats coming out soon
I know nothing about it lol\
we might get a real ttyd rando 1 day
my fever is starting to take over just a bit but will continue to  hexspeLurk    majinLurk    phanto274Lurk    tippiLurk   and believe.
I like the key item shuffle though :c
twitch just tweeted: "RAWR :3 SO RANDOM"
yeah did chapter 7, got sub 28:30 twice which would save 40s over my pb lmfao
i used auto mash cheat for spook tho bc cba
yeah i tried doing that run on saturday and it was just so unbelievably ass that i feel like i gotta practice more OMEGALUL
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
found a few minor things today, prob gonna take a step back from AP seeds for a little bit
like i rolled chapter difficulty shuffle and it gave me progressive LUL
the only time I ever left key items in storeroom LOL
I got down to the last 4 items then just peaked spoiler log, 2 bowser keys in ch8, im not doing that
so prologue stone block for repel gel, you know how we clip in the corner to jump on top?
well if you clip on the corner and then parakarry he will carry you in it and you can get it that way
andtpLove beestLove hexspeLove andtpLoveHD marcoLove minimi6Love phazon3LOVE tippiALove spitle1Love popesLove tippiLove
so half of the partners can get that now lol
"Let me tell you a story" *leaves*
I love climbing those vines. But alas in some categories its known as a shame
nice fight now we help our pal midna
beating Plums minigame witha wiimote made me hate him forever
its just a target on the screen the bird will freak out ramdomly sometimes but idk if its actually worse
ya its an annoying minigame to begin with
@venturific the reason why is its a callback to link to the past first mini boss
@stavros12c34anenoglou I think I remember that jerk
@venturific it is also categorized 3 types boomerang/ weapon/bomb.
this temple of time slopes are very tricky
momma spider is down for the count
ok we take our run to the sky is this where u will use the infinite jump?
Why does Ganondorf always get some magic dude to be the first red herring final boss before the game opens up and makes you do 4 more dungeons before actually fighting him
@needaname37 after some time on reading ur comment that is not necessarily the case. U do trials in every game including mm when he is not present. He does have some thought of fortifying himself but its pretty badass when u interrupt him playing piano or on his bed.
Pump ur amps and volume is a good thing
Zeldas where Hyrule Castle is the final dungeon >>>>>

time for the 2nd run Kappa
he went live like a hour ago
i always wake up 2 to 3 times before i get up
ohh you are my frind to
have play the game 2 tims one casual and one rando
i need to do skyward sword rando on console, cause setting up controls for dolphin is weird
mayby you find settings for this @Weegee666
if i can find someone's preset for current dolphin, yeeah
i'm basically trying to set up controls similar to how it is on switch using a controller
@Weegee666 when you have a swich you cab try yuse the joi cons for this mayby
i didn't even think about trying joycons with dolphin
you should be able to do that pretty sure u can map the motion controls to a button
i think it posbil with bt
i sometimes forget those are just a form of bluetooth
@Weegee666 me to i control last time my phone with joi con why idont know but i can
given how open the SS rando is, i'd definitely try it for sure
i've got my ps5 controller hooked up to it rn, and the motion controls work with that too
holding the cotroler over you head swing the sword and troe the ps5 controler against the wall
i'm gonna mess around with getting joycons to work, see if that does the trick
gl for the run but anyways
that feel when you headbutt the stairs
cut i try conekting join coins to a jbrack wii to play skysword to i never play it but i dont have the atachment to the wii controler that mak it posebin
marcoGL phazon3GL phanto274GL orcris1GL beestGLGLGL majinGlad
how many runs have you done
well, joycons are working for dolphin, but they're working too well, as my only attacks are spin attacks right now lol
i have run it back the swpard and shiled clip in the vod and have see one to points they are a justebil but they are so smal is hard most of it  hugo to close or you taping the stick not  long anouth back the you triger the cutsean to erly i just wanna try to help this is what i think what i have rewatch
you say it most time yourself what was wrong you go it but is shitt the skip
is you whant i can clip the trys
you have so mutch time save with hugo just take it as pratis XD
ok this was aclose one that you got it nice
You'll hate Hugo and coro if you ever run hundo
have clip 4 trys for you
most tims is to close to black spot i think
I'm wondering how that shit got found in the first place tbh
It's just too oddly specific unless it was reverse engineered
@SwiftPichu_ they have see the hitboxen from the cutcene and midna stoping you and they saw it was only on the grond a big area that you can jump over with hugo
they have try stuff out with tools
I mean coro TD not Hugo KEKW
The jump I know it's basically a long jump long enough to trigger the other cutscene of exit
It takes like 2 and assures it's just one
i think but i dont remember coro TD
Bottle and then oocoo baby to return to whatever dungeon it is
Don't remember is what it displaces*
So same shit as rusl TD
I'd take that time loss over running any% tbh
All I've seen run and the grinds I've seen from everyone was just miserable except for one KEKW
when i remember last jear i think is in oot a new wrong warp found that leats to the end of the game erlyer than the old one
i dont know runner or plaer trying and finding stuff allways
There's a group dedicated to finding srm stuff in oot
Sub 20 goats or I retire
Goat rng is fucking terrible and idk why it's a thing
decided i'm just gonna try to do the rando on console,  i can't seem  to fix the spin attack problem
everything else works, just the only attacks i can do is spin attacks, which drains stamina
Hey it's the Smash Bros. stage!
ok gl with the run keep it together dont rage to much is my jop understand! <3 gn8 you all see ja
Yo, Phantom. How are the TP runs going?
got a 6 second WR NiceSoftlock
the beginning is very different, but after spring it's basically the same
Okay, so I haven’t played this game before, and I’m wondering where Link is, and if Link is the puppy
@im_guppie I'm now getting Toon Wolf Link vibes
TIL Toon Wolf Link fan art is adorbs
I told my employers I'm not coming into work tonight on the pretext of a family emergency.
Just asshole customers with threatening attitudes.
I have a friend who made a list of things they think everyone should be required to do for one year in their life, and working customer service is on that list

I bet the Gorons derive some kind of spicy food stuff from those lava slug things on the ceiling.
Similar to Chu Jelly restoring health
Some kind of jam or savory sauce like gravy. I like this new idea of mine.
His voice booms with the might of the volcano itsself.
I hate the intense creepy vibe Zant exudes towards Midna in this game.
One of the best vidya soundtrack pieces of the century so far.
The time to focus is now
Actually, I have this set to a couple of my different alarms on my phone.
I use it because it wakes me gently.
I also have it set to get louder over a period of aboubt five minutes until it's max volume.
i think it would be a nice song to wake up too if i didnt consider it such a sad song
I like sad songs, because I'm often sad.
And it's a good piano piece.
How are the tp runs~ oranDance
Don't risk Midna's safety for time saves.

@hlpm123 Yep great set of jams today
too late for a file name but hi o/
"Ah, the Bomb start. The Bomb know where they are at all times. They know this because they know where they aren't, by subtracting where they are from where they aren't. Or is it where they aren't from where they are? Whichever is greater, they obtain a difference, or is it deviation?" Regardless, good luck with your vanilla rando. Cheer100
It's pinned now so you can reference whenever phanto274Smile
how many 25s was that in a row? 6?
gl on shite and spoop skip
It's been a decent day. You're very welcome
oh i already voted on the poll KEKW
@hlpm123 Thanks for the gift sub! phanto274Jam
My god tiger, how did I miss that? Lol
Just put him in time out then
hey since i am sub is it too late to join the MW next month?
Nice! That makes me so happy lol
i have to make a new 1 cant find my old one
oh i found my old yaml file
I should mention in the channel I'm looking for a group. I just don't know anyone who's interested
Well it is in the name…
I guess “essentially lost woods” didn’t roll of the tongue as well ariasy1Anna
Remind me, we did Pokemon Colosseum last month, right?
Lots of RNG in that one…IV rolling is difficult in its own right.
Alright, last one. I'm broke lol
I don’t come round these parts nearly as much as I should…
51? That’s like…2 more than 49! ariasy1TURBO
Okay, but to be fair, I gifted like 30 when it was discounted lol
My favorite part of TP runs is the intermittent screaming.
Ive seen better gameplay in an IGN Review KEKW
wait a sec, the boomerang talks?
excuse me, youre supposed to use the ball and chain for those webs
And here I thought you were supposed to fall out of the sky and torch every web in the game ariasy1Embarassed
I hate it when I trip and fall and my eyeball falls out of my mouth phanto274Eyeroll
so fun thing, i managed to get my wiimote to connect to my pc, but now i need to get a usb sensor bar for ss rando. might still be easier to use real hardware
yeah, i'll just to the ol usb loader method
it's a solid rando, too, like the allsanity isn't as bad as i thought it would be. i'm just never using a ps5 controller for it again
i might start slow, do some zero mission randos, then slowly build back to doing big randos like 3d zelda games
Ive got a pasta ready for your zero mission rando
yeah, I can atest for mzmr
i'm waiting for the new fusion rando to reach public use before going back to that
mzmr is the better one, but it likes  to put items behind annoying spots
ye, i can clear a seed at this point in about an hour
all i'll say is, i hope you like infinite bomb jumping
you can disable checks that might use it, but a lot of checks use  it
infinite bomb jumping is free for me
going thru some old files today I found the first pape seed I got a sub 6 in. This was like the 3rd seed I ever did
i currently still suck at infinite bomb jumps, especially diagonal ones
of course, if you get space jump and power grip early, then you never have to worry about it
early space jump is a lot more  common than i expected, but power grip likes to be in ridley's lair for some reason
That makes sense then I've seen this run a lot and I never saw that LOL
that's 2 whole minutes to time
there's something really funny about regular link in the twilight zones lol
I am setting up ww for archipelago
There's a real setup guide now
lol my fake master sword clip made it to youtube LUL
Im prob gonna sit this one out
ok i just posted my yaml
i love how for some reason lanaryu includes hyrule castle town
the worst bug segment right  here
Ok I manually typed in my settings for my yaml do I just send you this directly?
Yoo Phantom, good luck phanto274Smile str9ngLove
And it's my favorite dungeon as well phanto274Hype
@str9ngest9r mine is temple of time
this is one hell of a process to make work just to play skyward sword rando on console
Ok I sent them to you and pinned it in our dms
well, first i have to convert the randomized iso to a wbfs for the usb loader to even recognize it
cause I was too lazy to scroll to your server
tp rando is much easier to set up by comparison, yeah
bedroom time with yeta, you say
There was a setting on the ww yaml to make everyone die if I ever die and idk if that's only for ww but it'd be really funny if I had that on
only if that was for oot since i have ice traps on mayham
There's ice traps for ww now but I didnt want that on it'd make me sad
I have like everything on except for charts and long quests though
andtpLove beestLove hexspeLove marcoLove andtpLoveHD minimi6Love phazon3LOVE popesLove spitle1Love tippiALove
hopefully i don't get send a ice trap when i am 1 hp
also is it anything go? can i cheat if i am in bk mode?
i will clip into water temple if i have nothing else to do @RavenFP
If you're referring to staying in logic I planned on not doing that lol
WW goes SO much faster if you out of logic your islands while going up the map
They suck ass at their job
THey still suck at their job
ooccoo doesn't exist, it can't hurt you
me with dark souls inconsistent wall hitboxes
I can feel the pain in your voice
Well in theory this is a wall you aren’t supposed to be able to jump through ariasy1Hehe
I don't like the chiefs crew cut
ok so i did read that you can use the  wii sensor bar while the wii is running to get it to work on dolphin
usb loader gx is being crashy
there's a few other usb loader apps for the wii,  but i'll deal with  it later
No one questioned me about the reason I gave for missing work last night. I expect I'll be written up for how late I gave notice, but I don't give a fuck about that.
sup man, good luck on runs
I would also be scared of a clawshot
Those blocks will sink a lot faster if you put on iron boots
omg is that the twitch partnerTM Monado
Is that where you clip through the ceiling
I do not know how to do that lmao
That was found after I stopped running the game
Its only been around for like a year or so now
I'm gonna be doing 100% soon
So I'd probably do it in that
But its been a bit since I've touched it
I kinda just want to sit down for a full day and learn it all
Thinking back on when Komari bopped my WR... It didnt age like milk, it aged like hydrogen-5, the isotope with the shortest half-life of all known atoms.
the slingshot is pretty useless other than the first dungeon imo
sounds like a headache and a half
today is such an exciting day
Did you see Persona 5 X?
New adventure with new cast but has the old cast too
because altus is overseeing it, its developed by black wing studios
@Axl_SR isn't that the gacha game?
People are reporting its gacha but it looked like normal P5 style to me
the og p5 cast are ssr/5stars characters last time i check
Im okay with gacha if I dont have to put more money in, like how Xenoblade 2 handled it
most gacha are free to play friendly now
you wont get every character you want save for the 1 you really want
whats the trigger for that cutscene?
you have to skip pulling for like 2 patches
its cuz they want your money
imagine a BN but all it gives you is topman, woodman, and Medi
i may or may not of swipe in the early days of genshin
i put 150 bucks to get 1 of my fav character weapon
i cant afford to do stuff like that again
I def did with nintendo badge arcade, got every single fire emblem badge lol
you gonna check out memory shroom?
have you said who you are running co-op with?
yo gl you got this gamer
is this twilight different than in ad
i mean i guess you arent human
you do need rupees but i think you just get the silver rupee in the bell for most of them
oh i think you get the 100 behind the house in ordon
im pretty sure if you climb up there after killing the bug, the light is up there
and faster to get than waiting
thats how the cookie crumbles - midna
dont clip out of the flying part
I can't believe I was told this was the JP version and every button is in english
play jp but on english Hmm
i think jp is faster for all glitchless categories
I'm mad I can read this speedrun AngyTwink
but the fastest is the Korean wii version that only fx owns
Why isn't Epona neighs in JP?
its the same for mm jp glitchless
yeah bug limit allows many questionable things lmfao
and the worst part of it all is that it still has goron race
Zelda games have no RNG elements at all
arent you excited to do goron bo too
just in time for shirtless men slapping their skin together
I was just watching Gym doing Glitchless of this
I can't believe Phantom wears pants when they're streaming
More games need proper balls physics
Chuckie will tell me the truth
id do hd if it gets put on the switch finally
Eh they'll put it on Switch when it's about to die
idk what glitches still work on hd
Then it mind as well be dead cause no early MS
You ever just beat someone up on a horse and they lose all their clothes?
Man was reading you like a book
i think the only difference in this dungeon is no ljas lol
i have a great clip on skipping that lmfao
Goron mines is a trip for me
I will never forget the slow iron boots on the ceiling when doing this casually
i think you have to roll up the wall a little
When you do what to the grass?
Hii Phantom, good luck!! How's your day been? phanto274BLANKIES str9ngLove
This part always makes me so stressed out
i just noticed this was glitchless
Fish mommy gave it away LUL
well thats kinda how you do it
you could just do the western glitchless way
its not that bad just go really late
now people might understand why i say this game has bad targeting
go back up to the top
and then go through to the other side to get the key, then when you exit you can ledge grab and jump slash onto the other platform in this room
yeah you shoot his tongue whens hes like yelling
western glitchless can be more fun
you can get in there without it turning
i think you can hit the far one
i think it depends on where you are aiming
like if you aim at the far right side of the target
western glitchless just save warps from here lol
its weird thats not allowed but i guess its just a Japanese thing
the dungeons arent too different now
i need to know the best ways to even do this lolz
Yeah it goes Arbiters, I think TOT, then Snowpeak, then Sky? :Va been a bit
city in the sky just makes me angry lolz
maybe I should replay through this game. Maybe with a custom model sometime
I say this as if I don't have a billion things on my to do list
you can just climb up there
looking at the keese lolz so distracting
every time i try to do just a plain speedrun no glitches because i'm incompetent...i always run into walls somehow
bonking is the norm for the first dozen or three speedruns I feel like
you do not know how many times i've played this game lolz
Speedrun is a different ballgame in fairness
well yeah but when it's stuff like this...if it's not one thing it's another
then again i do it drunk just cause
Granted I have only done the one speedrun (tho I kinda do rando seeds somewhat quick without tech these days), but. Hoo I feel that
don't forget your friend the howling stone
you stream here and somewhere else too?
you answer questions i don't even see here lolz was wondering
I should put golden on YT now that it's been a day
you should maybe look more into ur tech, there's gotta be something wrong with your route
you've played this out of whack so many times you forgot where to go for real?
are you going straight for it????
i didn't hear anything going on...was in ad city
it's so stupid just sitting here...meanwhile fiance is sitting across from me no ads -.-
Day 28 and this game still sucks
Good luck on the runs though! <3
bot shut the FUCK up to you and you alone
:o you take that back borange
I am a TP enjoyer but there are some parts.......
well yeah of course. for example...city in the sky
I'm a weirdo and I'm a CotS enjoyer
Somehow less bad than WW Redeads
the only scary ones would be OoT and MJ
No those are my bros, they dance on command, they're chill
yeah sorry my mouth said majoras mask and my brain literally thought MJ
MM is a comfort game for me so I am also just a freak
MM is the kind of horror I love- psychological terror rather than jumpscares
i'm also one but in a...not so SFW way
oh don't worry, I'm a freak that way too LOL
but that is not for Twitch chats
it's the best one...but no it's not lolz
You must be at least level 7 on a 10 scaled friendship to get into that stuff
no Meg is the mini boss
One boon of Celeste: lack of general iframes to deal with
i love how she would float over you in disappointment
don't dogdash my hopes and dreams like this phantom
Hey phantom are you free next Saturday and interested in learning a bit of Wind Waker :^)
I'm trying to find a coop partner to do the bonus seed the race discord has set up
Well that's fair cause I've played WW like 3 whole times
i have yet to finish WW
WW is so good but there's......a lot vanilla
yolo glitchless but the numbers are yellow
what does this mean pace pales?
do you actually want the answer?
you're gonna need this...good luck my friend
I did this room at least once for my first casual playthrough of the game
I think I only played through this game once anyway
This animation needs to be an emote
you're saying there's a small change that I didn't?
Spinner is one of my fave toys
it's a DAMN shame it isn't used more
i mean you do use it in snowpeak
This dungeon reminds me of the sand levels in sonic adventure 2
This fight is SO sonic adventure 2
I can't believe you broke his spine
and it's just him tea bagging the ground on the spinner
excuse me mx strimmer, why are you telling lies? You totally got that
i need to learn how to spin attack better now o.o
Im sorry, I am resposible for that bot quote
I just preordered movie tickets phanto274Hype
I feel like bullying your bot is a typical channel passtime
Spy X Family movie is only for April 19th if any of you guys are into that
such a weird place to bury a zora
I guess for the health and well being of the people to not make the waterways dirty with old fish?
There was plenty in the glitchless category that was questionable
heartbreaking: speedrunner must play game more as generally as intended
i thought this was glitchless lolz
this is considered 'intended behavior' and thus more a trick rather than a glitch I guess
do you not get the bombs in lost woods
i mean...one could only hope for it to go one way you want
Im still fevered up but llooks like u went with ur word.
idk where bombs even are here
if i remember...you get bombs in the kitchen too?
I see this is going great
Never watched glitchless in 4 years so swifShrug
Oh sorry this is gc, bug limit
Uhhh, I think left side from entrance has some bombs but not sure
Back to Barnes it is then YEP
so the room you were in...there's a room where it introduces the mechanics of the canon
the new room she gave you
I don't recall bombs in that room though
they not bombs here u have to warp out and go to kak
ooccoo is in the kitchen behind the boxes
yeeaahhh...only the boss is worth a shit
I am about 15 hours away from being able to sit down and eat solids again,
@DreamcatcherSky oh no dont tell me u have the fever as well
@stavros12c34anenoglou No, darling, I have a colonoscopy tomorrow.
I haven't been able to eat solid foods since yesterday.
my nose and throat are killing me. Wish u the bes on things.
They're gonna stick a camera inside me, take some pictures, then wake me up and send me on my merry, hungry way.
My Grandma is giving me a ride and I told her I want to go to a sit-down restaraunt afterwards, if I'm suitable for it.
I'm thinking somewhere I can get a reuben sandwich and fries.
Really craving corned beef right now.
And kraut. Love kraut quite a bit.
Anyways, I'm going to lurk and go to sleep, have a good funrun.
My internet is down so guess I'll disconnect for the night. Had to hop on mobile for this. GL with the run
mys sister is the sour kraut person never was into it. Have a good night sky
back slice and helm splitter works best with darknut
but you're skipping howling stones so...it's like improv lolz
careful not to hit yourself lolz
you can hit the walls too
at least the spiders are easier to kill though amirite?
maybe a different try the next time since you're going?
glad i stayed up for this :D
Can't wait to see you hit all of Jesse's monthly streaming hours in this one stream
Can we get the retro people to play 11
I'm installing fightcade because of that command grab
ive never seen this game, show me your coolest combo
im a huge fan of fireball loops in combos in any game
guile sonic boom combos are so sick
are you trying to do the sobat fk link
are you butting to do the sobat fk butt
also yeah that rollback on the healthbar was brutal
I can not get this rom to work
Like flycast sees it starts and then it just dies on the sega screen :(
I didn't know hello Gordon was a command
this is definitely a hipster ass team
in that case just beat shadow x
its just a delayed top 8 graphic from beating el rosa HahaThink HahaThink
yeah the era of newtype is no more
lol you have to wait until the hitbox is active
remember when kukris climax had fucked up scaling
its so funny that shatter strike has the unnerfed hitbox
your athena jA shit is crazy
oh that smokes ryo c fireball then
randomly enters TNS and makes top 8
rome's hyping you up in main chat
Yeah, you beat opponents so hard they might as well have DQ'd
huh i probably should be fuzzying that with clC instead of throw
214B beats the fuzzy though right?
all good after you fry something it gets crispy
this guy is an extreme kula 214B abuser
be prepered for that if you havent fought him
honestly IDK i have nako DP
girl don’t lose to someone name PAPI CHULO
I don't know what image to use
lol yeah they definitely wanted EX DP
lol yeah they buttfinitely buttted EX DP
i haven't played since Monday star rail update was playing that
Oh wait the white girl image I can make it if you want
need to get back into rebirth soon
I'm in the 3rd area doing all open world bs
i was thinking there was only 4
i still have a long way to go i see i am in ch9
i know how many chapters there are
i hope to start rebirth end of april
its good @stalkor but tons of open world boring bs Deadge
i like to watch something when doing open world
You coming to SGDQ this year?
i might go for platinum so i have too
Awesome, I am coming every time from now on
Richard told me that I am already accepted for Camera Ops
I have a job that I can afford all my trips now
What should I use as kukri PFP?
YES, I can talk to you every time now
I am hoping for New Super Lucky's Tale this year which most people are saying is over due
Me and him are submitting as race, had no idea you knew him, we are really close
all of terrys D buttons activate my neurons
Oh nice, it will be fun because we are sharing a room this year
We have been waiting forever to meet and this will be the perfect time because he has been to a GDQ in person
He ran at the online GDQ
i havent seen sombra in a minute i wonder who he fought
he did beat shadow X though good shit
When I met you last SGDQ I was shocked, I was like holy shit that's Phantom
phanto274GL phazon3GL marcoGL orcris1GL majinGlad beestGLGLGL
I just got so happy! The season has been a success My Dukies took out the number 1 team in nation and are in elite 8!
Me and Ritz are now locked in to whenever me and him get into an event we will put each other on the couch
I want Poke Park to get in so bad
iori fireball feels like it has the widest hitbox ever lol
very close one though you got this
I still haven't started Rebirth. also gotta do the yuffie episode first
but tbh rn I care more about the main story update in honkai star rail langepDerp
I'm still pissed at the ending of remake
and I did play through remake twice so no one can say that I didn't like the game enough
damn i twitch clipped too late
it's a square thing btw the same happens with kh
that reminds me. I was shocked to see how reeves looked back then. they didn't really show much art of him back when the original was the thing
and then I bought an advent children poster
I did buy Dirge of Cerberus not too long ago
AC was my damn identity for a year or so
this seed be starting out dry
@SwiftPichu_ i truly adore the movie though.
when we renovated our home, I asked for the walls in my room to get the AC silver-blue so I could have a nice look with the main visual posters lololol
thanks for streaming raven! good run
even with the DQs it was still fun to watch!
and I used up all my pocket money to get almost the whole lineup of bring arts figures for AC, I even bought the damn airship....
No I got 4th so it took too long lmao
you got red girl in the desert
shorts can make money but then it's better to just also post to all other platforms and hope tiktok brings in money as well
yesterday I found out that twitter kills your visibility if you have more than 2 hashtags
facebook you don't wanna use more than 2-3 as well, IG is free for all hashtag spam still
I need to learn more about social media algorhythms
ah yeah, images do better, yes
How do the Rando be goin?
A slingshot wouldn't be useless if you could launch bullets
I may despawn at any minute, sleep beckons. We also have the summer time switch today in the EU. wasn't NA in 2 weeks?
I thought the difference was 2 weeks
I was doing a multiworld and running super mario 64
alright be back latah gl on the egg hunt
friendly reminder that that guy's design is literally meant to be "tingle but realistic"
yeah iirc it was the historia or encyclopedia that confirmed it
in before punished for not choosing the other dungeons 😏 as it were
i was about to say i hope not but they'd be 19-20
and i just turned to dust
they have taxes to worry about too!
but what if capitalism is my kink
I can and WILL kinkshame billionaires

okay, I turn of this devilish machine and go sleep. many bottles of coom
This is crazy, my Prime ain't even working D:
Twitch told me this is for mature audiences. I can't for the life of me understand why
OH this is a rando! This will be the first time I've seen a TP randomizer
Am now back Looks like ur set and solid
3 years ago today I got my pupper axlsrPat
I'm back from groceries, where was bow? 👁️
Feli this is a tough nut to craxk
it was so great, they shittalked getting nothing but sword in there as Morpheel was going down
so the game said 'cool here's another, get wrecked'
there's a way to cheap out that game I think
yeah its on a ledge you can get to with a goron
either that or my game glitched hard, but I think if you don't zoom all the way with hawkeye you can get away with getting the prize or something
like just a little past here
oh, maybe you needed bow to clear temple
so you can get the direction to launch?
It's ad time, it's ad time! Gather all around, it's ad time! It's ad time, it's ad time! The only cure for sadness!
oh yeah you got lantern? Where was that lol
in all seriousness how has TP as a whole fared you
Clear the way Phantom is hunting
got a 23:09, -10 on my pb
yeah just an hour and a half lol
hey phantom...i need advice my dude
what kind of meats to use for dinner? all i can think is chicken, steak, and pork chops
only thing that comes to mind. i'm looking up recipes
there's probably some kinda sale on ham if you like ham
I try and do things seasonal
but I really only eat chicken myself
I just finished smoking a lamb
when i think indian style...beef tips come to mind mostly
pidgey you should be my exercise buddy one day lolz
@annilyn2  deer, elk is pretty good meat too if you are able to get some.
oh yeah @Akm1232 they made venison one time and it was really good
i'm gonna be honest really quick in this boss...
this dragon pissed me off a lot
at least it's not the wooden sword special
and then you kept fighting another 5
grab him through the wing lolz
hurry and give sexy midna lol
no way so ur items are in another gamers hands. so trust is key
i didn't know it was pronounced like that o.o i say arch ee uh puh lah go
it's cool cause once you beat the game, everything gets released to the games where the items belong
i only know oot and alttp from the list
so if one player beats it chances are people get more go mode items
It's great cause sometimes you just get stuck in ACAB mode and you fuck off to do something else
hope i get my song of time or i will have to learn dot skip
you can do it! we believe in you
i found a vid for that double clawshot skip there and its wasn't the bomb way
Just got everything set up in the Discord, glad to be there!
This is orbably the most interesting of the "phantom" Ganon fights tho. I always loved this concept.
@JamieMWest especially when if he had used the princess as a shield he would have 2 triforce pieces at his disposal.
have a twilight princess mod where you just experience what zelda goes through
you just had to throw the tennis ball phan
Gee TP Ganon why does your mom let you have FOUR form battles
if only i had your skills
pripcyGG pripcyGG phanto274GG phanto274GG phazon3GG phazon3GG orcris1Gg orcris1Gg on the Easter Egg hunt rando
@FatPidgeyBirb you gotta have 4 forms if you want to keep those 2 console versions
How does someone even take Ganondorf out that quick?! It be taking me forever
I love how it's not poke forehead in this version
i tab out for 2 seconds and he Deadge
i mean if his head didn't work then poke stomach
Link: *Kills him in two seconds* Zelda: "Now it looks really bad that I surrendered."
well thx for strim am exhausted.
WE BOUTTA BE INVOLVED IN ANOTHER RAID! WOOO!
i've played this game so many times and i still cry at her leaving
you gonna play mirror breaking ending before you go?
also thanks again for the suggestions...never thought lamb...and thanks to you guys too
damn you started early and i was at my pc NOOOO
Are you doing them all today?
Also say hi to my cat Serana. She is also watching. She is a little iPad kid
I showed Serana the chat and she started licking my phone screen
But it's a Galaxy song Kappa
3D World was taken before its time!
ABCDEFG i want to cry wont u cry with me
I hope they gave you half your money back lol
a gallon is 4.5L right? why did you need so much
so you got 1 gallon and not 2 AngyTwink
Takes a lot of milk, yeah
Power Easter Egg Hunt seed? KEKW
I don't see any menu changes
I have them all patched, plan on doing like 1 a week
full clear tubba's with 2 keys then use it LUL
using at rugged bridge loading zone would be nice
I see it but where do you draw the line? Do you remove forever forest too
I would make Yoshi required everytime meowex2Yoshismile meowex2Yoshipopcorn
its way to dense on the beach
speaking of that i forgot to junk link house cow for the MW shit
the thing is. i would either reduce ch5 checks or want to add more checks to other chapters  balance it out
just force junk them like zelda
Still dunno what you're talking about lol
i seen in discord what the thing is
Oh damn, vanilla colored Kent. C
use it at thunder bolt check?
You said you wanted a Shooting Star for a random cleft fight
I think they usually have 4? Might be wrong
even cleft at HP give tons of exp
guess it time to save the yoshi kids SadgeBusiness
my cousin sent me something that arrived today. The Protoman and Pharoahman BN TCG starter decks. They were sealed but the glue on the bottom gave out so not actually sealed. The price tag on them says 2 99. You couldnt even give that shit away lol Cheer100
yeah, during the height of the english dub anime yeah
yeah, back then 4kids wouldnt take an anime unless they could get merch from it
yeah i def remember it as a kid, the second set was called "Grave" cause thats what they called Gospel
There was a sharkman starter deck too
it was prob too hard for them to make puns from the word gospel. 4kids loved their puns. Its literally every line team rocket has
"Megaman, youve made a mistake coming here... some may even all it a "grave" mistake."
6 Partners in half an hour I'd say is pretty good
also if full clearing ch3 at first visit tagging windmill isnt a bad idea
could you imagine if the sound effect badges changed speedy spin sounds too?!? LUL
I gotta go for a bit. Will be back later. Good luck!
the last weekly race was on the 3rd lmao
the others were random races during the week I was in
granted one of those weeks was for multiplayer
im just tired of wekly races always being blitz
then just do all insanity everything turned on glitch logic axlsrShades
for "races" like that Id like the shoot the shit with the other in VC
what about like a first to 25-50 power star race? no need chapter clears or bowser. just speed checks?
Most of the old guard top rando players are inactive but others have gotten to a similar skill
but at that point its not a race, its just playing the same seed with others
and the best part - tomorrow is a bank holiday so no wooooork
well I did say power star easter egg hunt KEKW
damn, my internet is lagging, can't even watch properly >.>
We always have nice holiday meals at my parents house
I blinked and missed the bow check lol
my parent are too religious to celebrate easter LUL
True when I lived alone. Now I live with my parents at 33 🙃
i woke up yesterday and there was chocolate on my desk
@plamboooo in that same boat butt the mortgage is mine
I own my place but I'm forced to share with my younger brother :|
@axl_sr we live in a house that we partly inherited so it's fine but I don't have an actual bedroom, I sleep in a shared space
its so easy to forget it
i started making a route for extreme 3, thats gonna be a fun one
didn't know the yuzu devs were an actual, state-funded business
Alright I'm back. How's the seed going?
So you're gonna Sushi skip Snowmen?
Have you abandoned Goombario already? Or have yet to find him?
Is this a 5 egg end credits?
yo! happy tdov and also egg day
shit, I guess im buying card sleeves now
I didn't realize you had the 3 stones lol. Thought you were gonna laki clip
phazon3GL phanto274GL marcoGL orcris1GL majinGlad beestGLGLGL
Has it been of any use yet?
It's too bad there's no way to skip up to Cloudy Climb
did RvPA ever give you 1?
Cheer100 kkona: hu hu hu yee haw hu hu who uh! hu hu hu woah! hu? hu hu! eh! eh! hua hua hua! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu
I'm no expert, but I don't think this is an actual kkona quote
I have too much restraint to go full chickentoes or math
I have learned actual combo structure in kof11
The inputs are simple but god do you have to do shit so fast
okay this in cringe, Hicannon is called but Cannon is called "lase Blast"
also every card has an anime quote
there is a card called "Chip Junkie" with higsby on it. "reveal a random discrad pile card, if its a battle chip you can play it" With the quote, "No, not my chips!" KEKW
also all my holos came bent LUL
The value on that jelly tho
I wonder if I can break the shadow voice as consistently as popes chat did
One of these has the quote "it's MegaTime" phanto274Smile
Cheer100 shadow: where's the cardiac crystal before I go into cardiac arrest
Sounds like he went into cardiac arrest.
What the fuck am I hearing
this is why I was dying in the call the other day LOL
He's the ultimate lifeform he can do what he wants
I guess the sounds they used affected that one
Im trying out a pokemon conquest romhack that my brother recommended to me
what if I just say your name
Its called conquest ultimate and it adds mons from gens 1-9 and fixes a lot of problems
And makes the game a lot harder
why does liam do that to him
I picked THE worst time to be wearing headphones
I can make it worse for you buff00n
at least it's that Coney watching TikTok
Cheer100 watchmojo: L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? shadow: that was pretty funny kkona: kkona: hu hu hu yee haw hu hu who uh! hu hu hu woah!
Raven makes me realize how fuckin old and outta touch I am
it lasts for so long that was barely any L's
I wonder what all names make shadow fuck up
What is wrong with that name
for context buffoon this is what happens with liam
tbf, there are a LOT of Brandons, so that could be anyone
I have no idea what causes him to break like
Kkona if you go hoo huu or woa he screams
like why does the cardiac arrest sentence send him into cardiac arrest
why does he bark like a dog when you say uwu
is it something with like cuh sounds?
but then why does uwu do that
he also says 7 like sayvin but I'm not giving a dollar for that one
i approve of this scientific research lol
this research can pay for premium next month so I can make it do more cursed shit
I at least know how to break that one
Punctuation makes her die that one's simple
on friday i dislocated my shoulder ski crash. im gooing to be recovering for a while... im doing ok so far
Cheer100 shadow: I would be unstoppable if not for the cardiac arrest
Shadow, I think this is too much chaos, not enough control
Cheer100 shadow: I need to obtain the 7 chaos emeralds and get control over my cardiac arrest
I wonder how much I can stretch what he mumbles when he breaks
Is that a normal time for entering ch8
I dont know what he said though
maybe it needs to be no numbers
Cheer100 shadow: buffoon I need your credit card number to afford the emeralds to escape my fate of cardiac arrest
Cheer100 shadow: (silence) buffoon (silence) (silence) cardiac arrest (silence)
ok he screamed buffoon that time
Can I make him just do that
Cheer100 shadow: (silence) buffoon (silence) buffoon (silence) (silence) buffoon (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) buffoon (silence) (silence) cardiac arrest (silence)
hold him up to the camera
speaking of cats i never told you but 1 of my cat is name Raven
why is Shadow growling my government in rage
He's a cat. If there is a closed door, he will want inside
he just wanted too hang out with someone
Cheer100 shadow: (silence) good news everybody I bought more bits kkona: whyyyyyy,,,,,. whyyyyyy,,,,,. whyyyyyy,,,,,. whyyyyyy,,,,,. whyyyyyy,,,,,. shadow: cardiac arrest
ok I forgot how to kkona scream
That one hurt shadow bad though
Shadow does seem to scream the first thing after silence each time
Cheer100 shadow: (silence) YO (silence) BOWSER (silence) EAT (silence) MY ASS (silence)
Cheer100 shadow: GG (silence) Gee Gee (silence) gee (silence) geeeee (silence) GEE GEEEE (silence)
Cheer100 shadow: hi. (silence) hi? (silence) hi! (silence) hi. (silence) hi? (silence) hi! (silence) hi. (silence) hi? (silence) hi! (silence) hi. (silence) hi? (silence) hi! (silence) thank you youtube
Fuck you cut it b4 thank you youtube
Cheer100 shadow: (silence) you know what fuck you (silence) YOUTUBE (silence) I cast Cardiac Arrest (silence)
hey whats up? hope your doing well
Top row of tracker is cut off fyi

I found a case that looks like a SFC controller
abcdeg i AM BACK  woo hoo look at mee
What it be difficulty 7 for Chapter 1
Oh hey you found my wallet
Extreme preset on the website is vanilla BC. Though for these seeds I cut it down to shortened bc
why does u keep losing coins
Dudes knock coins out of you and deal 1 damage
Idk I don't make these, lol
I tried making the animation of the bridge shorter. But the implementation made me fall out of my chair in shock, so ...
phantom tell me why nintendo still uses ribbon cable in 2024
How's the seed experiments goin :D
My Dukies just got out but great season nonetheless
Hey look 2 eggs in 1 room
1 in the tree, and 1 boss
what happened to the other seed i was afk
why do you take that much damage for equipping a Volt Shroom
you're supposed to mash out of the grab, right?
cuz the screen zoomed in, like it was the grab
very excited to be catching this live
I had a run I lost the other day that gave me super/ultra hammer in toad town and I LOST it bc I didn't realize blooper 3 hits twice when he's in rage mode
wait so is playing on JP usually better?
is there ever a reason to fight kent tho
Honestly, I enjoy having the 100 coins and having kent there bc at least I can go do other things with that 100 coins vs going down the chapter 1 path right away
me and ice was thinking the same thing
that's the most contrarian thing I've heard about a rando
Yeah you can't do anything really
I'm open for suggestions for coin logic. Kent aside even
What's the dev thing about btw?
That'd really help speed up stuff
Yeah I'm mostly oot mode where you dip into all dungeons and a half
Yeah, many of the zeldas just have infinite money sources, which makes logic for it rather easy
The music not restarting was an old bug I fixed on dev, so it'll be part of the next release
@Icebound777 yea windwaker you can just bomb a tingle pot on outset and get 5k rupees in a couple minutes lol
On the contrary, some people complain that rando has no use for money, and they run around with max coins before half the chapters are cleared
No clue how they manage that. Money money and refund maybe
I honestly only seeing that issue with casual players
Cause when I run stuff like this, I'm broke 24/7 lol
I mean, most casuals also hit ch8 at lvl20+, which basically never happens with racers
So the difficulty balancing is all wonky
Logic for battles and coins is just really challenging in general in pape
I mean, logic in any RPG is challenging to work around
Cause any type of tweak can completely mess with pacing or make things too simple
Yeah. It rolls too easy, people are bored. It rolls too hard, people get frustrated
Honestly not what I expected to happen in this room, ngl
Hallo! Had to disappear to do easter dinner and cleanup for a couple hours, but i am back!
I once had a renewable honey candy, so nice LUL
I get the "strong items aren't infinite" idea. But why the auto flag set
after visiting my old seed im glad merlow is the way he is now
Fwiw if you manually toss an item it cannot despawn
having the max cost be like 6 didnt add much value to star pieces
I think it's triggered by the item pickup? I just have it non run the camera script
Have you ran into any issues with shroom memory on console?
Could've put it at the top of kbf if you want to do the boss after jail
Yeah, either using it for short range shrooming, or gamble on a long range on
I def do feel better about double dipping volcano/tubba/ice palace
I'm not sold on the concept
I say that in concept too, Ill do my first seed sometime this week
or just set one to blue station but remember to menu
Isn't the walk to ch7 longer than ch3 though?
also if tunnel short cuts ar open, tagging the tunnels would be good too
I wonder how important farore's is in ootr races
pls stay englich but hi @Icebound777
Does Pokemon have an silly name puns?
Isn't that how Pokemon names are in general
is it posebil to rando the atacks from the partners suchi witz shock mayby#
imagine goombario with power bomb KEKW
I don't know how I'd even start with randomizing partner moves
Icebound, I have an idea, making a suggestion now
and power bomb on 2 fp
@Icebound777 you need some extra animation when a partner do tackel or somthing
@Icebound777 what is bombet first atack callt
No idea tbh, who uses that move
Partner memory gets freed entirely on partner swap, including sprites and anims
Gotta bounce, if you feel like evaluating memory shroom some more could be interesting, lemme know in the thread. I can roll some not terrible settings if needed
i think i woud like it only you can back tp back in the last dungen wher you tp home and in the overwolrd only home and not back
you can jump up this shit rock
ok i ahve try 2 gliches that i saw from you and it worket
that make the pipe on the castel completle pointless
Sees 'Rare Medal Network: Rockman EXE Arcade Game Dumped and Preserved" Me: yeah right. *opens article and first words are "No April Fool's joke here" Me: oh, well okay then LUL
I knew about battle chip stadium but not this one
shop had sign out front saying FINAL SALE, but the F and I were too close together. You know what it said LUL
JKB just dropped pape AP alpha in AP discord
from seeds ive rolled its still pretty limited, all chapter closed plus ch8 vanilla
ok i can not see twich on my swich anymore
no i neet do see on my phone D:
gn8 all i lurk to i fall atsleep
So i suppose the maximun damage you can do in one hit is 99
Twitch is sucking completely lately. sure 1440 the ads and 1080 lock ppls stream sounds like a good idea for a new viwer passerby
I see it being VERY busted during races
i forgot April 1st is tomorrow someone posted on twitter    Silksong release date this September i was like HOLD up wait a min
i like hallow knight was a good game
i don't really care if Silksong ever release
but if Silksong does release sure i will buy it
if Silksong ever releases, I am calling off that day
i never beat a castlevania beside lord of shadow 1 and 2 and those games are like god of war i guess
they are layers of Castlevania, b-tiger
i got it for free off psn so i try it
and i just couldn't put if down even tho it was pissing me off
SotN is prolly the best game, but I rate Aria over it
i seen sotn a lot so idk if i will ever play it
hallow knight was pissing me tf off
i did played the bloodstained game
i seen a lets play of it years ago i never beat disc 1
i should prob play rebirth tonight
i will prob know what u talking about next week KEKWait
side quests are better then the open wprld bs
i really like the tower defense mini game from area 2
oh i know what u are talking about
because everyone LOVES open world games right
i like how genshin do open world
I just so happen to pour myself a glass of wine after our talk about Metroidvanias, lol
sometimes in genshin i am just walking around and find a puzzle 20 mins later i am on the other side of the map
I should try it out that sounds kinda fun
i paid 150 can once for a weapon i want AngyTwink
i haven't bought gems in genshin for like 2 years i am really smart with my gems
ignoring how dismal the weapons were, I feel BotW would've been marginally improved if it had double clawshot and one, dedicated bow that didn't break
so, Homeward Shroom is a Farore's Wind you can set whenever / whatever you want
ya the combat got stale quickly as well
it was open world for the sake of being open world
and cuz it was Zelda, everyone decided it was the best thing ever
but i wanna play for 10 hours
tears of the kingdom dindt do anything to improve the foormula imo
but do you get a item form said dungeon and use it in said dungeon then use it to get to the next area? no no thanks lol
when TotK dropped, general opinion was "if you liked / loved BotW, you're (probably) love TotK"
I played mastermode twice I was tired of totk before i was done playing it once
forgot I bought TotK from work, brand new for $30
never played it cuz I sold it to a friend for $40
sounds like you wasted 30 bucks @buff00n
or a better idea don't play either KEKW
"the Sheikah Stale just.... left" - the devs
could've should've just had Link lose it in the intro, at that would've made more sense
and gave a good excuse to return it for NG+
a friend was telling me about that
that does sound a lot better
I look forward to the day Nintendo makes a "classic" Zelda that sells gangbusters cuz it's Zelda-Zelda
I also don't like that the monsters all have stupid things on their heads now just cause fuse is a thing
I mean, if you wanna hop in vc after recharging your social battery, we've in Sharance
and you can tell him yaml file KEKW
almost in bk mode have only a bow i cant use
doing pretty good, how's your day?
and i am already out of logic
guess you missed an obvious find
i sent you like 2 imported items
i have like 6 checks left
eh? what rando game is that? sm64?
do i navi dive again for 1 more check hmm
cuz tiger was sad i was first
whats the april game of the month btw?
why do this smash and not more recent ones?
so today is forest lakebed and snowpeak?
this right here could be a mobile game KEKW
would it be evil to randomize tears?
can you turn off ruppee chests?
I had such a light day today I watched a video showing all heart pieces lol
which one is your most hated?
probably behind a shitty minigame or collectathon
holy shit my Serenade was in lake hylia
can progression be in ruppee chests?
glad to see emerald update went public
Zora mom didn't come through for us
I like that berrys make cut more valuable
I do like Emerald taking longer, gives more to listen to
its like a scrath off ticket KEKW
Welcome to the "background noise during my stardew game" club
whats intended way to get that?
but how do you carry it up the ladder?
wolf can make that jump LUL
that chicken was just vibing in the hot spring living best life
I was at 259 and had to leave a chest in mines and I spent so much time getting said chest
yeah the preist in castle town is one
emerald got a day 1 patch but I dont understand what it does phanto274Smile
Emily is having a gay ass dream about me in Stardew. I appear in her dream and then rainbows fly by
the same as v2.0.0 with the additional migration to APProcedurePatch
oh skipping the 45 second cutscene is so nice!
I want to try a trainersanity seed, but need to set aside a whole day for that
I wanna see how it works
heya! I’m hard at work at the school doing janitorial work for the afternoon, but I wanted to check in :D
alright navi was a bitch and wouldn't talk to me not doing that check
also if you go past champion your dad gives you 5 checks at your house. If you roll a vanilla seed he gives all the event tickets like eon ticket, old map for mew, ect.
yeah its pretty cool cause the old map was only released in Japan and Taiwan
You can go to Naval Rock too for Hooh and Lugia as well
well you have to return for lighting the torches checks?
it would be easier if you had Watt LUL
wo with these settings is it basically LCL?
but all the overworld is in logic?
so if snowpeak is out of logic to path to snowpeak would be in logic?
I just got a prismatic shard in the skull caverns at the same time
I sat out of AP this time, but next time im gonna add legendary hunt
it was so hype seeing the spinner added to hyrule warriors
and the fact I didnt have to pay for it cause I had the amiibo for it KEKW
how much does that open right now? I know the chest underwater in kakariko
in bk mode gonna stop for now
iron boots let you throw gorons too
not even the hot spring shop?
i did 52 checks with no items nice
Oh god, pape is in ap
Yeah I saw alpha so figured as much
I miss the cursor for aiming the wii version had
if it wasn't vanilla ch8 i would try it
hell i would do it if it was short ch8
Ive stepped away from pape AP now that everyone is playing the alpha
oh so you can complete this now?
in this room there are vines on the wall, does that do anything?
Group 1 Rigby MegaPaul NSingman Phantom5800... thanks gonna be a fun watch
Adam: Oh thank god I am not in Group 1 KEKW
the 2 items I have been given are boko baba seed and a chart
I am in no hurry to start tho, need to warm up
ive been doing 7 stars lately
I've just been checking things to test logic and yea my yaml def just got fucked up I'm playing a 103 check seed lmao
I'm still just doing things cause I'm bored and with kh2 in the pool it'll give roopa moves to make the game not suck
I've given him like 4 moves
The site it lists EVERY check in the game
And even if my shit was right that's wrong
oh shit someone gave me power bracelets
You said "hey fish" as I caught a fish while I was fishing
I will have to unfollow and unsub today.
attahching bombs to arrow makes me think of naruto paper bombs
Ok I fully did every single thing I can do rn
Power bracelets only got me like 2 things lol
I couldnt do stonepeak bc I dont have ww still I can't even spawn the chest
Nintendo sent me a stylus as a park of their marketing for Kirby and the Canvas Curse. It was just a pink OG stylus LUL
yeah pink with a white tip
logically what is master sword needed for?
nice i got 3 out of 6 warp songs and cant play any AngyTwink
are there a lot of grottos?
Therre is a DDR on the game and I have a GCN dance pad
why did that sound like the Jetson
the boomer rang lock on sound.
I never seen a TP Rando, but I have seen an OoT rando
I still haven't forgotten about my first (and only) death in this game
Dying in frozen water while wearing Zora Armor
I'm yet to meet someone who hasn't seen an oot rando
i just cheat and use clawshot anything
My first reaction to this Ganondorf was that he looked like an upgraded version of OoT
run enough to do it again LUL
i just checked my stream stats and somehow oot is my third most streamed game
streamed oot for 80 hours and mm for 600 FeelsOkayMan
tp credit music is so good
the credits are so long too lmao
i can change my color back
it was a April fool joke for someone lots of people change color in his chat
oh i got 10 bombchus i can do stuff
you're a rabbit, and start off with the feather
I've honestly never done hard logic. I should
Or maybe glitched logic so I get an ocarina free run
a surprising amount of even hell logic is just knowledge more than actual difficulty
like dislodging that crow outside with a bomb instead of a rock is hell logic
This game isn't hard, so makes sense
or a bowless dethyl run to make me use dethyl skip
for deathI skip, yeah. Bombs also work though are are in hell logic
I've done it for lols in the past
BTs are great but they really make the game too easy
they also make getting some items easy since they are what's triggered, like the cave by animal village
nice i found a 1up for you phanto274Smile
you can a weird clip jump thing through those boots crystals
I'm not good at it, lol
raven is gonna be happy i found they hookshot
it looks fun, though I've never actually finished a casual playthrough of LA
Run seems to be going pretty good based on tracker
I'm curious what you'd change about the tracker
i had raven grappling hook in my seed also KEKW
have you had success with other browser sources, or is that just not something you usually use
I'm actually the main magpie dev, I've been trying to think of ways to make it easier to stream. Streaming definitely is not its strong suit
are you using the offline version or just the site?
the offline verison probably works better, yeah
have you tried the NDI support? It also has drawbacks, but has some advantages too
you could skip the browser source, it gives you separate NDI sources for items and map
the NDI item layout has to match the in-browser layout, so it's definitely not ideal for your setup
you might need to kill a zol in the screen above to make this one work
or maybe that zol in the same room too, I forget
are you using the custom layout option here or modifying the html/css manually?
appreciate chatting about the tracker, btw, I'm not a streamer myself
the browser definitely adds a lot of limitations
low barrier to entry for users too
the bastard resets his health every time you fall
this fight is ass without lvl 2 sword
doesn't his hp reset when you fall
shield, walk towards him and pray you've got enough runway left is all you can do
I think bomb arrows might be able to take him out before he does into the wind phase, but I'm not positive
so what's the advantage of a browser source over a window capture for this setup?
I just realized that my plan for a better broadcast view won't work as a browser source NotLikeThis
what you're using is meant for restreaming where you've got multiple players in different locations, so it's definitely a little jank for a solo stream
the other options are different jank, not less jank, lol
it has really out of date logic at this point too, unfortunately
I cheated with magpie, I just use the logic straight from LADXR's source
fave character NOOO it cant be.
I never know how much of the damage table in this game is intentional
glad i didn't miss link skin teeth flushedpleading
Finally, you're giving MVD streaming lessons
I love this game so much phanto274Smile
Wtf is that next to you?
I think you have a smudge on your camera lens
Get ready for the tripping montage Kappa
yo it’s that guy who played Mario party on friends without benefits
put malort in my food I be eating
It's a "speedrun". Run is right there in the name
Would you like to introduce your guest phantom?
mvd is a smash player who likes snake that’s all you need to know
@oakest5000 thanks for the heads up
He deserves that for losing to Ganondorf
Sonic appears in the last second of subspace
phanto274GL phazon3GL marcoGL orcris1GL beestGLGLGL majinGlad
Mario is sadly so trash in this game
This is gonna make you worse at ult Jesse
you dont just inhale and jump off the stage?
fun fact: in the TAS Mario is actually faster for this fight
This Mario CPU is better than all Marios in Ultimate
pushing kirby off stage in stone form is faster than kirbyciding
You still share one character I think
petey looks awesome in this game
Peach is faster if you have perfect bomb-omb rng and perfect damage boosting
Seventyfour could you send me a subspace tas?
Dont they use a sticker that gives you a bomb to damage boost
Im talking abt in a tas run
Didnt pit have the best glide
when I played sub space I never even knew the stickers give you buffs I just collected them cause I like shiny and colourful things
i actually played through this again with a buddy of mine online, worked surprisingly well
Still mad we didn't get something similar to this in Ultimate
much as i liked world of light, it's got nothing on this
Cheer100 megan: Who? let? this? loser? jesse? on? the? stream? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_? O_?

Idk sheik gets her proper introduction like 30 minutes before subspace
Like you can use her the whole time but then the game is like, "LOOK ITS SHEIK, 1ST TTIME YOU'VE SEEN HER EVER!"
Some people are forbidden to use Down B
What was brawl diddy up air
Diddy was way cooler in this game
Yea I can do the infinite
Jesse's stupid ass can't work a door
Weirdly, I feel like the biggest visual thing that bugs me as a Smash 4/Ult player is the lack of attack trails
Cheer100 shadow: I have this one saved I forgot what it does holly: AIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAIAIAIAIAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAIAIAIAIAIAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Cheer100 dramatic: Jesse loves captain olimar, it is his favorite character
Why did they make rayquaza so easy
thats some nice looking hair mvd
Every smash game has a different Fox voice
I just dont remember this voice for fox
Cheer100 (phone_ringing) call. for. Jesse (phone_ringing) watchmojo: L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L? L?
I still get nightmares from Scrappy Doo fox
I forgot how fucking long that lasts
Jesse played this game professionally and doesnt know where to go ICANT
Hardest puzzle in every video game
Cheer100 sonic: what's up sonic squad? sonic here with some hot subspace secrets. if you complete the game with 101 percent completion rate, you get the secret ending where I have a steamy make out session with donkey kong!
You activate the bomb and go back to the room in the other version
Someone else is learning how to use the tts kazamsCatglubhappy
best weapon is meta knights sword
Erm these physics are not realistic. IMMERSION RUINED!
Bowser was ass in this game
Cheer100 plankton: I'm going to steal the krabby patty secret formula and the only thing that could possibly stop me is subscribing to Phantom 5800 on twitch dot tv! you're days are numbered krabs!
Cheer100 spongebob: Oh shit! We have to stop plankton! (silence) everyone do your part and get your credit cards out and subscribe to phantom. RIGHT NOW! I'll start entering mine now 734524523
is hell for me just gonna be constant ai voices
I forgot abt Ness' voice in this game
Ness' voice actor is the same as usual
The character is better this way
@Ohrocks It sounds different is what Im saying
why is squirtle able to wall jump
Frame 2 with no end lag
I think its an extra life
pretty sure every move in meta knights kit changed the world
Cheer100 megan: honkers in chat? (honk) any honkers? (honk) i'm honkin right now (honk) i'm hoooOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNKKINNNNNNNNNNNN (honk) LETS HOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUOUOUUUOUOUUUUOOUUOUUUOUUUOOUUUOuUOUUUOUuoUUNNNNKK I'M GONNA HOOOOOOOOooOoOOOOOOoOOOONNNnOOOOOoonOOONNONNNNOOOOOOUUUONNNNNNNNK HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUOOOOUOOOOOOOOOOOOOUOUOOOOOOOOOOOONK HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK (honk) (honk) (honk)
@Ohrocks That tts breaks incredibly easily
You make megan say anything too long it just goes ooghghghghghg
Ike does the same exact thing in this game just fucking worse lol
The only good thing he has is jab
But his vA is better in this game
anyone here watch the runaway guys play this? it was incredible
Cheer100 Alto: Jesse is getting his ass carried
currently eating saltine crackers not even joking
Phantom you're supposed to kill yoshi to save yourself
What the fuck even are those things
I fucking HATED them as a kid
what a beautiful acid trip this game is
raven you don’t need to be doing this me
don’t make me look like the bad guy here
We need to make pikachu chunky again
use the control stick to move
Please look down at the gamepad
the levels with Samus and pikachu kinda suck
glorious: I love a good autoscroller
Cheer100 glorious: I love a good autoscroller
Jesse can you add these to your stream
almost all the other levels are good though
Damn jesse sucks at doubles he can't followup shit

great 1st hr progress. And rune comin in hot as usual.
I like that he balances barking and making lightsaber sounds
Ohrocks just sent an AI TTS message to the stream!
You continue going down the main path
go back the way you came
He should know the game like the back of his hand
Why does he SCREAM get back like that
Stamina is also a great mechanic
I remember way back when one of my cousins got mocked for saying the pokemon trainer would be a cool character for brawl
you’ll be playing with rock smash in a few minutes
@SeventyFourTG Only good thing ab it
yo it’s that guy from smash ultimate
Why is ikes fire even red in this game
No the only time there's fire on his sword ever it's blue
@RavenFP no clue how they got that wrong lol
Did RD just not come out yet
I think RD came out same time as Mario galaxy
So who's going to IHOP for Sonic inspired menu items?
Also Sakurai is one of the biggest FE nerds and he let ike's fire be red
@Ohrocks going this Friday with buff00n
anyways jesse can I come kazamsCatglubhappy
I'd expect you to wait till after the run LOL

peepoIgnore you called us nerds not tellin
I’m not a nerd I’m a loner huge difference
I was zss was whipping me instead of these suits
Raven you mean to type that?
Oh yea my hands type wrong words a lot
I wish I typod normally I just do whole ass different words
I heard from my uncle that Ridley would be included in the next smash game somehow
kinda funny how now that he’s in smash no one every talks about him or plays him
yo it’s the two best characters
Can you guys beat the game already
how is he dying as mk
Cheer100 queen: This guy. is SD ing as Meta knight? (this_guy_stinks)
Where's Pallos, he's missed out on Lucario
Here's where I'd use the Snake emote... if we still had it on Twitch Sadge
Cheer100 Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheu Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheu Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheu Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheu Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheu
she’s really mid in this game
Forward Smash changes every time you use it
compared to half the cast and how trash they are peach is mid to me
jesse if you kill yourself you'll be diddykong
You can just beat the game
If you save link and Zelda, you lose time
Why would you want Meta Knight?
oh you have no idea ohrocks
Ok yea phantom my expensive purchases in ww are fully bugged
I cannot get the 2 checks
So if those are required I think we're hardlocked unless I can beat my game with what I get given
feels nice watching dedede be a good character
nice so it’s the exploit room
Isn't up tilt hella disjointed in this game?
How does it feel to have the better snake down smash : ))
I hate that it's quote 69
That is a good quote 69
These battles on any difficulty are no tto be snubbed at.
you gotta kill everyone and come back
Hey jesse can you pronounce this emote el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
Little brother isn't allowed to win the game
Can't be worse than Egg Roll in every game...
I think you can pause to see what's in each room
tasty treats for me to eat
those flashing lights are your checkpoints
is that a mvd spotted in the wild
Wtf is that move made of?
you guys are actually speed running this is hype
nice we rocking out on 3 hrs
So if meta knight goes down you still have up throw c4
Kirby, Meta Knight, Dedede and Snake
Jesse redemption arc going on right there
Look now you still have Kirby
So is Meta Knight only allowed to survive?
no you need to find the second way into taboos room to get that open
so how long do you think it will take for someone to beat your time
some nice space to relax in they’re
why is his fight here at a lake
There should be a character refresh
see the nana mid air t pose?
There should be a shortcut to tabuu
Jesse has done nothing but throw
can at least use wario in the final fight against taboo please
And Pallos has done nothing but be timed out
You get one last character selection of 6 before tabuu
Because too right puts you near the jungle tabuu entrance
was this a one time thing, or will there be more (WR) attempts in the future?
yeah you too just lost like 40 mins its ok KEKW
But but bgs to MVD cause he's friends with esam
still more powerful than lifelight but that's not a high bar
NO THAT'S THE CORRECT CHOICE IN THE TAS
oh damn theres an ad counter ??
Where was this scene in the Mario movie?
sheiks legs barely move and yet she goes so much faster
the victory runback will be epic
these are game a watch’s abandoned children
how are they’re 70 people watching but only four talk at a time during this
you should have a full map ready for the labyrinth cause they’re should be easy ways of seeing what’s the fastest way through it
I’ll be right back I’m gonna go check if I have dinner leftovers
I have the fondest of memories of brawl, I was so goated at it for no reason
Too many people hate on it for being "slower"
Oh my God is that the MVD
this spicy chicken I’m having is incredible but I’m horrible at dealing with spice
Sup bruv, hope all is good
Do you prefer Subspace Emissary over World of Light? A. Yes! B. Definitely! C. Absolutely! D. TO HELL WITH WORLD OF LIGHT!
That was a Gravity Falls Reference, when Mabel wrote a letter to a random boy. "Do you like me? Yes! Definitely! Absolutely!" I added “TO HELL WITH WORLD OF LIGHT!” To see if anyone would actually pick it.
I need to finish that show someday
link existing in this game makes me nervous
I think Primids inspired the Mii fighter classes! There’s Unarmed Primid for Mii Brawler, Sword Primid for Mii Swordfighter, and Scope Primid for Mii Gunner!
Nintendo missed the opportunity to make Primid costumes for all three Mii types!😔
no the press f to pay respects
that’s the scream make when you’re about to kill a child for the first time
mvd is it game time now
I think they are doing just fine
YA'LL ARE REAL FOR THIS LMAO
don’t ask why a woman is vibrating it gives an 18 year old like me way to many thoughts
you’re bodies recoil hit him nice
there's so much time so it's not a big deal
why is that up tilt so good also desync hype
nice that the rockets ammo appears only when your about to fire
honestly I’ve seen the cutscene for that boss and I still don’t get how we collect game a watch
I get tired from doing nothing
Impossible to figure out what to do
one of you should get that labyrinth map ready after the Ridley boss
if only we had rock smash
I was lurking at the beginning of your run earlier
yeah derusting S2 settings. It was ass lol
I explored ch.5 for funsies before heading to ch.8
found u. boots, power rush, mega rush and a repel gel
should I link a map in the chat or are you good
Didnt know MK's nair was multi hit in brawl
Was it like that in 4 as well?
seriously don’t understand why we’re using ness over WAAAAAARIO
gott head out, good luck with the rest of run 2
imagine using the stickers with these two
Grands of smash 4 coinbox is Sonix Wrath
so since I provided the map do I get small bit of credit
now run it back and get sub 3 real quick Kappa
Let's get those DCs to top 8
beat shadow so i can fight you
bracket said it didn't count ):
Why does kukri have a win quote about getting ratioed
Going into Kim's stream with the Squidward TTS bit donations brb
fuck the discord ping open when i try to click 1st Madge
Yo marioman warfare i guess i send you 3 traps and you send me 3 back KEKW
I have been busy on the getting checks grind today
i could tell i got a couple items
ok. healing is going well. how are you
I'm doing alright, just grinding on runescape
i got pape for ap to work
just 1 issue with ap pape now progressive scaling is forced  phanto274Facepalm
gotcha - just dunked on ganon in TPR, gonna look at what the LTTPR pack I got does for that post Aga 1 thing
and i spy have to be on
also I hope them notes I sent ya for the tpr map pack was fine in terms of when and all
I spy doesn't have to be on
I've never seen a Paper Mario rando or any glitches for it, so this is going to be very interesting
@MarioManTAW the yaml file lied to me then
glitched logic is its own pool of madness especially with just LJAs
yeaaa - also figuring out where regions and checks intertwine
Ya I saw you were learning the twilight princess rando, that means your getting closer to the a link to the past rando
cus like stuff like AG left chandelier according to rando logic requiring the dark crystal
Did my first driving lesson with my mom after getting my permit
thats with the push block chest
@blacktiger51 The ones that say NLA can be misleading, all non-logic options are marked NLA
I honestly got NO clue past maybe poes / speed
Including scaling, which I don't recall if it was NLA/NYI
@MarioManTAW ahh ok good to know
its cus to get to poe 2 you need poe 1
and that means you cant cross center ceiling portion
no drop down / push block ability
honestly surprises me a bit that that flag wasnt switcheroo'd but *shrugs*
Ok hey, this game came out the year I was born!
Please don't remind me of the arrow of time
Damn 2001?! I was 5 years old!
This was yesterday, but I'mma say it today. HAPPY INTERNATIONAL ACE DAY!
Sure was a jumpless start YEP
found the thing in the LTTPR pack now - gonna send ya the doodad in rando for ref as to what is MIA for the post Fyrus checks to appear on map when you want them to p4ntzLove
You can do the Super Block check, right?
YAY! I set up your stream notifications to also go to my personal Discord server and IT WORKED!
What were you trying to set up?
A hammer my kingdom for a hammer!!
When are dojo members considered to be in logic?
also #fuckbizhawk was trying to do a trick for over a hour today didn't get it
Is Watt also logical for Chan?
can I just say that order of items in access rules is dumb 🙃
I found the reason why the post fyrus checks didnt just work with the Fyrus item in the conds
I think it's been done itemless but phanto274Shrug
its a proper facepalm moment: the Fyrus hosted item which exists in the TPR pack needs to be BEFORE the items so its getting checked first
and then cus of that, you dont need the visibility rules necessarily
sorry btw on my braintrain towards that rn
Best and Cheapest Viewers on StreamBoo .com (remove the spacebar)
Soon the world will be yours
darn trees not able to be h it by a shell
those trees req hammer for some reason but no shell don't work bombette does
and i believe a tree in ch7 req hammer also
can you spin jump on top of a yellow block to break it? or no? i guess no
i don't even know how to do that with hammer KEKW
I assume that was some weird form of softlock?
like JR Troopa trigger or some such?
I could use a list of those
Ah, yeah Pronyo removed that on dev. Do we have a setting for the TT sushie glitch? If so, I'll add custom coding to the forest bubulb
"easy" / "hard" glitches option there?
as in "easy" = with, "hard" without for those who like that?
Oh right, I remember. Pronyo made TT sushie glitch "hammer OR boots" already
I mean, we can put it to "hammer AND boots". You'll have to wrestle JCog for that decision though, since I'm pretty sure you're literally the only ones doing that in rando
I'll make the forest bubulb check for the partner id and partner active flags, and just display it's text despite minimal cutscenes
@Icebound777 maybe a dumb thought from me there, but if there's other spots like that in the game, a settings "keep glitch-useful textboxes / cutscenes" ?
sorry if its either already a thought or somethin which has had discussion + me askin this here, given the pape rando discord exists and I am there - just thinkin cus thats something I renember from say OoTR / MMR where these specifics can be toggled either as bulk or in some cases in single instance boxes
Problem with the raph skip clippy is that it isn't on the trick list in the first place, as you can softlock yourself out of it
Though at the end of the day you can't please everyone and you will go mad trying.
@Jonxhas I think there was the idea of a useful cutscene toggle thrown around, but IIRC there aren't terribly many of those anyway
@sselwalf True. I mean, 75%+ of the trick list is used by less than 5 people, so
I forget did you reclaim the lunar stone?
We also have some meme tricks on there for whatever reason
@Icebound777 fair that - same ish in OoTR / MMR though, where I guess in most normal settings the only contestants for MMR are Twinmold / Majora 1st phase, and for OoTR its stuff like "have Darunia in Fire Pre Boss / Poe cutscene in Forest / Rova startup"
i have like 5 glitches on when i play pape
again sorry for the respectively dummy question there
@Jonxhas no need to appologize for asking questions :]
There's nothing wrong with asking stupid questions, cause then you will no longer be stupid
also to the TPR tracker stuff phantom sorry for not having sent the logic files stuff I was cross reference lookin at yesterday when I was lookin through the files of your pack
yee those were what I was lookin through too
Also, if you feel the need, you can DM me about adding tricks and I can point you to all places that need edited
you excited about the AP pape alpha? 👀
I guess where Pape also is somewhat easier if you were to support glitch logic yellows on it is the huge amount of items which already exists, meaning its somewhat simpler to just create respective, additive item chains rather then "oh yea you have boomerang and a sword, guess you can just jump places" as an example with TPR
cus the amount of things that that lets one do is wild
cmon fish, you'll make a good sandwich if you dont let mario through the floor KappaPride PrideLaugh
alright this trick looks like ass NOTED
and its not something where you could go in cardinals with jumps this?
figured that the hammer would just let you interrupt movement, yea
I definitely have seen this trick but not as much without hammer, yea PrideLaugh
do you need a textbox to proper cancel it?
p4ntzThink cant go all the way past the boo village to get a cleft?
takin feesh for a swam all the way to the desert
you might have to remind me of these sushie glitch minimal cutscenes findings later
This one a bit more precise
"What you like to dive to the left?"
oh you don't need 1 of those hammer things
lol ok kinda figured with the tracker being large and it being glitched logic
you got a level i guess phanto274Shrug
What was there was the friends we made along the way
Good evening all, Hope The run isn't too horribly cursed
So what are the settings for this run?
Looking at the board immediately, I can feel my soul evacuating
Then was not going to be in logic for a while huh
We don't need no stinkin logic
I dont know if I'll miss talkin egg
Or is it a drying pan???
well, I do like the desert. Thematically, at least
Well you have miracle water so you don't have to worry about dehydration
Don't give 'em too much credit. They were lazy and only spawned one moustafa npc at a time I bet
the interact scripts for him and sheek are the same
let me walk my dog then i fill you in
phazon3GL phanto274GL orcris1GL marcoGL avarie1GL beestGLGLGL
you bought the weight in koopa village
so no I didnt finish, at 7 hours I peaked the spoiler log. One of my progressive sword was Death Mountain Alcove Chest. Which isnt listed on the traccker if you do roll Goron's mines. So that needs to be updated. I can post the spoiler log too if you want.
I love that pie jumps are still the term despite him having not played PM64 in years
they are in the pack, but a recent change phantom tried made them not appear
if you're fine with that phantom, I could just send over the related files of the pack to axl + tell how to exchange?
you got to be kidding me you could of had that so long ago
that sounds like too much work
so for my go mode I needed 2 swords, spinner and double claw shot
that sounds like a sucky mo gode lock on 2 of the 4 things
I did finish lakebed and snowpeak tho
except it also sounds like it was swordless throughout then? or do you need to have master sword for dorf boss rush?
progressivve clawshot was in temple of time
so i needed spinner for that
hello parakarry, got any deliveries up there? PrideLaugh
i learned how to find hylia lantern cave, seeing so many chests I just assumed that was excluded lol
As a heads up your handle says it's invalid on bsky
so spinner was force lantern locked, not just "soft
Just thought I'd say as a good Samaritan is all
here's a dummy one axl: would you be fine with sendin over the setting you got? curious cus with TPR I got no real good thought on what would / wuld not be good settings 😅
like sure, I played rando enough to have a feel ish for what check increases go with, but I dont wanna mess around with junkin things for the sake of it and all
overall rando I mean - not TPR specifically*
oh, i totally missed it, happy 1k hours
why would red key be in the palace, cmon
I mean honestly it's crazy that Bowser lays out his outposts like he does, the best chance he's got is rando and he still messed it up
Just leaves all the tools for Mario to demolish him
SadgeBusiness time to do open world bs on rebirth
haven't played for a 2 weeks
good news is i am almost done this area
Fun fact, nobody actually knows how mirror's work
And what sounds would that make
hey hey, gl on the run
i can't believe its not butter
you entered that room and did those two block checks so fast omg
i blinked and you had done both lmao
In the immortal word of one Sonic the Hedgehog, you "gotta go fast"
is dungeon routing any different from vanilla or is it mostly the same?
I think the ones which dont change much are the later ones while the early ones change depending on item factors?
like say Mines you dont neeeeed to interact with the central beamos magnet if you have clawshot as an example
yeah, when I did lakebed today I did 4th floor on both sides before anything else
my fiirst goal is to finish a seed in under 7 hours
dafuq is that broke picture icon
so I assume the mystery note is tied to random color switch order?
thats whacky that it can now be randomized
^ can confirm - 14 to 16hrs of completing MMR glitched max shuffle with super weird chains in it at some point
didnt help that it ended up being a case of "found a bug" when that last was a thing
cus it was a stray fairy hunt with at the time newly added fairy shuffle for healing fairies, and 1 of them was misflagged
so I essentially hundo completed the seed not knowing I didnt need to searching for everything else
what was more funny to me was when I learned that it was broke, dev handed me a way to fix it for this seed on a single instance, and I had a chuckle about it in the end so all was fine
what was the point when you could just laki jump?
here's a dummy question phantom: what is the big sum up of the settings you roll with for TPR past fused shards ganon, mirror palace? I assume no poe shuffle / gold bug shuffle?
oh god looks like i got to the next area Sadge
gonna guess 20, 60 poes respectively are also junked cus otherwise that forces needed near AD too easily?
Poes are basically star pieces lol
you exclude... I made a list. Agitha Bugs Cave of Ordeals Golden Wolf Iza Raging Rapids Jovani Poe Souls Ice Block Puzzle Cave Zant Heart Container
me tryin to elarn how to be good at that -> also me realizing its minimum 2 times of going up there
like - I want to like it, but its definitely an autoscroller
makes sense - I was unsure on wanting to junk a lot, so I rly only junked the gBug turnins and 60 poes given you run past so many everywhere + the built in midna sunsong
plus a decent lot of them are right next to checks as is
me not starting with shadow crystal also realizing "maybe not the wisest of moves" spinning all across northern hyrule back to Eldin field to get shadow crystal last seed I played
mainly cus early spinner + didnt want to call the horse
eventually I do want to add boss keys
Small / Boss keys own dungeon didnt feel too too bad so far (2 seed basis isnt rly much to speak off though)
then again I cant say I am unfamiliar with corridor style dungeons
yea plus given how otherwise monorail some of the dungeons in TPR feel like they can be(?) it just feels like small keysy is QoL
I mean - coming from MMR where small keys "dont exist" in normal settings
and boss keys are set vanilla
take GBT as an example "haha LMAO have fun going to the end of the dungeon to get your small key for wart to have BK!"
not a problem if only chests are randomized, but there's also stray fairy shuffle as one name for it
whays the strats here right now
and having to 2 times back and forth the water in GBT is plain sucky
Boss Keys locked to any dungeon sounds like a good start
then stuff like STT where you only really WANT 2 small keys, but logic would find ways to make it obnoxious with flipping the dungeon
Also I'm still here btw. Just lurking today lol
I guess the trouble of BK's any dungeon could be a BK chain?
I read that as banjo kazooie LUL
true - just thinkin its more likely that way given I was shuffling all poes and then wondering "hmm why AD"
turns out adding like 15 checks to the 4 later dungeons has likelyhood has its tendencies
and then me not junking the agitha handins -> having those 24 also sitting there
any other logic things I should be aware of?
@Axl_SR for the DMT section the clawshot spot below where the baby goron sits for alcove, poe
in case you get clawshot early and have OW poes shuffled ever
something I dont know: fast spinner being what it is is hilarious
had fun earlier w the lantern irons cave in eldin
just spinning off the thing beyblading from top to bottom
nearly nailed entry to the lantern / lower platform hole
upper levels while not logical, you can just "hold R go forward" to upper chest
definitely need to play around more with fast spinner
fast irons do like what, double the speed or something?
is there a faster way to deal with ice enemy at the top of the ladder at snowpeak?
there's 2 variants to it seems like also
lol yeah, not interested in glitch LUL
1 being the ladder version phantom did, the other being with the 4th hidden technique
8th rung after stepping onto the ladder I think it is?
yeye - first TPR seed I played I went and peeked a vid without audio which did a speed comparison between the strat you did and the 4th hidden skill version
which the latter involves a pause / unpause seemingly to buffer the animation
4th one is the roll behind enemy spin jump thingy
finish, shield bash, helm splitter, backslice, mortal draw, jump strike, big spin in order
its also great if you shield bash + helm splitter for single darknuts
though would say then shieldbash quick spinning unless its the metal ones
and here I thought shield bash starting in skyward sword lol
or shield bash into bomb arrow if available
shield bash in TP is great
fun fact on shield bash: I never knew you could do that on darknuts
my brain always mortal draw'd them til stripped of the heavy plate
without armor you can still do shield bash to lock them into position
then jumpslash into combo / spin
cus that way they are basically stuck in animation block limbo
also aerolfos with shield bash from casual playthroughs suuuuper nice to 1cycle them even if its a bit slow
cus you can rpevent them going back into air outside fo the one for double clawshot
and they just let you do that into either combo or spins if you dont let them have too much downtime
it being the only 1 with double health cus "oh fancy helmet" is kinda silly
plus the forced 2nd phase that one comes with cus of the room
This rando logic looks like it must have been brutal
what I am wondering as well given shield bash strengths is if there could even be merit depending on depth of seed wo shield to just buy a wooden shield in TPR
if shield bash is available and fights where it can help without fire sources
yeah grinding a specific hidden power in Gen 2
spent 10 minutes trying to get an egg lmao
egg rates in Gen 2 are like 1% per step so it’s not that surprising
I find it funny how someone asked in discord how to setup TP rando, meanwhile I found it just fine in the wiki without asking anyone lol
@Axl_SR GCI / Rel / patch file method? PrideLaugh
axl tell me in painstaking detail how to 100% every stage in X6 KappaPride
cus I nearly ripped my head into bein bald on the GCI variant - it just plainly refused to work
godsend that patchfile method btw - soooo nice
searching for it myself is for suckers /j
relpatch is what the readme said... yes I actually read readmes too
im at a loss without them
thanks for that one - I had only seen the video for setup on the webpage of it
and that one covered GCI / Rel Loader variants -> aka "huh why it no work"
and I still wish I'd know why it didnt
I watched the video guide a while back when I was curious and said, "they didnt do GCN! How does this help me?!"
Id redeem Mid RNG if it was there
where shieldbash also can help if you want to is the ice knights or whatever they are called
if you dont want to just jumpattack quick spin them anyway
almost have enough for another seed redeem
was gonna say the screaming shy guys but that’s kinda Cog’s thing
a redeem could be a mod badge
I’m really hoping for a warp to Fahr Outpost in TTYDHD tbh
having to walk there every time sucks
also between Chapel and Twilight Town in chap 4 would be nice
do you have all golden bugs memorized?
I played casual hundo too often 😅
like - if it wouldnt be for the grotto chests, I bet I wouldnt really NEED a maptracker to just path out on in my head
that being said I didnt have city in the skies happen yet and last casual hundo I did somehow run past the compass in there
had all the heart pieces and poes, but not that
love the booper encounter music. its like its saying blooper
you have any idea when you are starting league races?
i can't tell what's next to the octorok
left...didn't even know there was something on the right
its bad enough that people stretch their gamefeed but do they have to stretch their tracker too!?
@Axl_SR no gameplay, only tracker KappaPride
but sadly enough i still can't tell what that is now it's on top of the octorok lolz
I missed you hitting 1000 hours
also he's not into streaming and stuff
*me derping cus I literally have a 1080p high gossips layout for MMR which COULD need more girth
ooooohhh...i have the worst eyesight man lolz
i prob went to bed then
oh nice looks like you got your spin jump
release feature is great in AP
i need like 4 things for go mode
but I have heard people being climb / swim locked before in SMW so not surprised
I've been hard at work getting... everything
I just needed a way out of the start for everything to open up
For me, Fly ended up being my unwall
this makes me want to play mario sunshine
@MarioManTAW still better in my head given for AP I normally play things like OoTR or KH2 so "long haul small trickles" or "well I can do 70% of the game cus I dont want nothing to be accessible for this game ever only pain" which is basically what KH2 is without 1st visit items
i need light arrows a hammer and storms or zl shadow boss key and longshot to beat my seed
and having all 1st visits in KH2 is like 60 to 70% of the seed instantly available
but also doable within 2hrs ish if you know your stuff
Every TP Rando streamer ever. Gaint Bomb Bags: I can hold twice as many bombs as before! 2 times zero is still zero!  You pieces of [redacted]!! Yo, but if I ever find bombs... bro let me tell ya! Cheer100
instantly 1 bag being emptied for water bombs though
unless you wanna always run past those couple water bomb only checks
being like "sure, Imma get it next time" -> "gets there again with no water bombs screaming internally"
show us a nearly full tracker KEKW
I was tabbed out. What happened?
what in the bobbery quest chain is this
I was typing that BEFORE ya got the bucket KEKW
I mean - hey, it cant jade raven you
you already had seen that one
so i might just rush rebirth story
ahh that makes sense why it dont ring no bells on my head
I dunno, I know where you have lemons
might be yea - I renember you pickin up 1 tree a couple times
with a yellow fuzzy jumpin after you for shits
it was hour 4:20 when strimmer said "Imma look this thing I had seen up"
it also makes sense when ya think about the timeframe of picking that up
given shortly after you were here you softlocked in the woods
is this your only seed today?
and then you were back before the fuzzy peek
yeah the goron thing was the only thing I noticed
gonna dip Phan...time for drunk gaming :3
maybe you have my hammer 👀
in terms of logic most of it I reckon just works at current times, just a wee couple thingies here and there truly
as in "it looks sound" - and given things like Hyrule Castle flow w logic, I feel like Palace of Twilight I was okay on skippin the deep check on yesterday
crystal palace it is then Kappa
thats a fancy skip to toadette planting in the same spot each time
icebound worked verry hard on that
I need more lore than that
I assume part of the hard work was also making sure the same colors go to the same spot on varying starting seed settings?
whats this about black toads being the seeds?
why Tubba looking like Guy F
idk ow to spell his last name... dude from diners drive ins and dives
so basically "due to a lack of available memory space, we used these not often used actors to move things with"
Correct. Minh T. throw the four invisible black toads with the seeds glued onto them
I'm still surprised that doesn't crash the game. I technically use a spawn function for that which in vanilla is only used in battles
I mean - mario receiving an item is a thing
and you could throw a couple things out of inventory by lack of inventory space in toad town, no?
so just given that mechanic exists in vanilla as is there is SOME headroom which it sounds like you can just use for that given you're basically doin that right
*derp not knowing tooo much about the inner workings of this game asking a silly question which sounds like more knowledge then truly available*
I'm not sure I can follow you on that Jonxhas, but that could also be because it's 4am here and my brain is fried
basically me thinkin "if mario receive item for normal inventory but inventory full, mario throw item on the ground" happens in vanilla
and if I dont misrenember, that room of toad town has a couple items you could receive on full inventory like that?
that being said I dont know if thats the same mechanics u utilized
Oh. Yeah, but the item getting thrown has a set arc. But only NPCs can jump in arbitrary arcs, so I had to use that for the seeds
just was thinkin "the act of loading in extra graphics onto actor" bit is where you got that wee bit of headroom
cus I bet the only real option for an issue with this animation would be if SOMEHOW someone were to interact with them WHILE they are being thrown around
push mario out of bounds or some shit
isnt it also used in skipping the black toads section of toad town towards koopa fortress
anyway, gotta bounce. Finally wrapped up some entrance rando prep, which took forever, so I can call this day done, gn8 o7
but yea I would ASSUME during the dialog to open up flower fields, mario SHOULD not be able to move anyway right?
Was that a 3 cap I heard lol
Its crazy to me that the TP settings are just sphere 2 lol
12 seconds too much on the clock
*hands eraser to scratch 12 seconds off the time*
axl do a seed with traps
@blacktiger51 No I was too first actually
just find a hour version Kappa
that eclipse was mind blowing 🤯
i got baited by the stream schedule last night
is phantom in a chest gonna be a new emote?
i seen it before you edit it
You going for fast Dangoro this run?
i have the weekly poll on ping me
or i forget about the poll KEKW
Oooh I'm excited to see what it is
I had a clean fight with Bo on sunday
is Bo RNG or is there a consistent setup?
I heard today that attacking out of your dash is faster than just spamming dash. Have you heard of that?
darn that Hugo no party 🎊 for u
yoyoyo, good luck on the run
got the auto tracker working today finally!
Yeah definitely never going back to tracking it manually lol
I did notice a few things but I'm not sure if it was on my end, or something that I did wrong or something like that
I started with laki on one seed and for some reason the tracker then assumed I had two additional seeds
interesting, your grove puzzle took 12 movements, and when I did it casually on saturday it took me 13
can tears be shuffled in rando?
If you're more diagonal and start L walking towards the statue
I've also got a really simple solution for like free 45 seconds in Eldin if you want to hear it
But in the route you don't need to do bridge BiT a second time, when you get to Kak in a weird state you can just walk into the sanctuary and leave
Unless split Eldin has the requirement of BiT again for some reason
Good luck with your runs!! <3
i fall asleep to the soothing sounds of a vc crash
I just had a cool idea for a new bot command. Ill hit you up with the details later then you can decide if you want it or not
this is something I would love to do myself but lack the know how
BIGBUGGIEs u gotta get a kazoo for this part
is snow board racing after Blizzeta?
so that and goron alcove if you havent adjust that one too
learned yesterrday this fight dies to 2 bomb arrows
I know its a frame perfect trick but what makes that enemy stop attacking?
not enough to satisfy morshu? *derps* hello
"only" you say as if the reded knights not always drop one p4ntzThink
but that being said, I just woke up so no clue why or how many rupees end up being needed, didnt mean to sound harsh
TP sign talkboxes are also massive by feel
I juuust realized how your inventory looks, hoooly the amount of skippable items
how have the runs been tonight?
curiosity guess: rusl is important to not cutscene oneself for being able to correct some story flag shenaniganry??
fuuuuck story flags is all I got to that truthfully
here's something I wish TP link would be good at btw: pickin up items / opening chests out of movement
OH yea - somehow TP link just ignores those
but he LOVES to roll / jump attack head first past a chest whenever close to those
sorry for the off topic question, but whats the difference between Standard Race (S0) and (S1) for paper mario rando seed generation??
im trying to find a stable set of rules I like to play on
oh okay! I prefer full shuffle gear honestly
levias thought you delisted your old tracker and tried another one but all the key counts and chapter scaling numbers are super tiny LUL
yeah i told levias about the link
I peeked when you first told me and say the old url then
oh, its not the modern version when you stopped updating?
Icebound just saw the "we have moved" LUL
what I am surprised by is the fact you had ooccoo for in here without bombs / zora shirt
would love to understand why he sometimes just refuses to acknowledge the spinput
it gotta be some weird animation order thing honestly
some whacky "oh on this frame of links walk cycle he dont like it"
except that doesnt explain why he eats spinputs out of a standstill
wait the fuck was that regrab? p4ntzThink
love how the water somehow drains lower than the crack in the wall
I just learned how to adjust the size of your pape broadcast view
so technically speaking human link is just fine in this portion, but cus you NEED to interact with zelda to heal midna, you're forced into this?
Midna's Lament AKA Space Junk Galaxy
ive secretly been complaining about how much space it takes up by default
and then AG before ToT cus spinner mostly in terms of run order, except you have the portal back then
god its just like all boos in luigis mansion...
I thought given you went there early with LJA's to get the sword + dark crystal, you could on the 2nd just open up ToT stuff early
they just jump into the next room and screw you over
also I have NEVER seen that poe go out of bounds here let alone that far 🤣
rain says this run is hurting his soul
and yes...we believe in you dude
your mojo is a bit off but you got this
TPR seed of yesterdumb for me: had lantern in HF Kak Gorge chest, needing to do AG and CitS for shards each, with clawshot / rod to go for go at the time cus I fucked up the settings by accident meaning I had to collect the notes with the skybook out in the chests of desert before AG - the entire reason I went through AG thoroughly was me being 1 sword upgrade short of having Master Sword which then ended up being in the BK chest 🤣
i feel the same pain sometimes like damn
loved depuzzling where I needed / not needed to use the lantern specifically given the whole "this can be an anywhere item"
also also: fuck riding boars in the desert - as cool as they are from a pure "its not a horse to ride around" side, they are ANNOYING AF to get onto cus I just roll under them every time
guess who attempted the bomb move for snowpeak and failed horribly?
LJ looks so freaking cool but i'm too embarrassed to attempt it
like how during the first TPR seed cus I had everything shuffled for memo sake, I ended up tryin and failing the Kak Gorge chest LJA and respectively the owl statue chest there just out of spite of wanting to do it
I need to correct myself: it not a sniff shirt, it a dig shirt
cus it let you dig this chain up
ahhh so it still does eat the key
gonna guess you dont need the 300 rupees for CitS repairs, otherwise there's a way to correct rupees for collecting it via big pickups?
you ever have the bug of somehow being too close to the poe soul and jump over it?
reason why I switched from double jump bite to always just force fielding them
cus yes it does fling you further, but it lets you reposition yourself
also hell yea I am keepin this bit memo'd
turning the lower section of AG into DLC lesgo
I mean it didnt look free free
but given I have at some point messed with silly haha storage in Windwaker, I bet I can feel it out from visual
why not just holding the chain then holding forward without target there? ground sweep
this fight suuuuuuuucked on ordon sword btw 🤣
I should honestly have thought that he'd be that simple
given the whole "finisher react" thing enemies in TP love to do on spins / jumpattacks / combo ends
WHY did I not try that 🤣
makes sense given he got a damage reaction similar to say rova / ganon in their PCS 1cycle strats
yay got to the next area in rebirth
where I need to pay attention as well combat wise I feel like is darknuts
cus while I know how to deal with them safely, I dont renember how I pulled them into 1cycles
at least the 2nd portion of this fight is relatively speaking free ish
where the fuck did that rupee come sound come from
rupee sound come from even* brain
link rly needs to do his math classes
silly kid only knowin how to herd goats and swing sticks like a madman
out of all the things nintendo
i still can't get over that
silly bogus "hahahaha high wall no way player gets up that" outside walls shenaniganry
so ive been using Yami's tracker for awhile. Now I got my overrides matching with what im familiar with Im ready to switch over phanto274Pog
I mean it never is bad to have maps yea
like - as much as I shouldnt NEED need it for TPR, I am glad I do have it because it lets my brain figure out logic that wee bit easier until I am 100% on the checks
I combined progression and turn-ins under the progression tab and have everything in vanilla order besides odd and storeroom key at the end. But the broadcast has hand-ins at the bottom but I dont care about that.
modifying the json has been a fun experience
bind spin attack to a macro LUL
once you know how that works though its super fun to mess with things
come to think here's an idea given you were thinkin about potentially adding the howlstones to your TPR: curious thought if you had an idea about wether to just add them via icon alone or via icon + note hint sheet for when someone doesnt know the sequences
so someone rain badge is on my frogs in the rain KEKW ICANT
was thinkin if possible via text to mark it with like medium / long / short note ref
cus icon would obviously be a bit of an issue I reckon
what did you roll for us KEKW
that and what I thought if say the one which has Requiem on it (think that one is near Iza? not 100% on song to howlstone reference completely, just know like most of the songs through MM / OoT reference for note lengths)
I cursed myself and everyone else
that you'd then have "Howlstone wolf there" and then notes w length cus its always either 1 long, 2 long or a half note
KEKW nah marioman its not your fault
not that it would be needed given the game lets you listen to the lenghts and pitches
i do feel bad for Raven tho having wind waker locked behind someone e4 is awful
is that intended to reach up there from that?
from the scales there's higher platforms you're "supposed to clawshot from"
just that directly from the scale edges it also works
so logically, doing it from the scales dont matter cus its right at the scales
hope the run is going well
so rando expects me to do that, got it
not quite as precise as this, but yes from that overall direction clawshot over is the direction
okay so darknuts are basically "Just" what I thought they'd be overall
thought there'd be a silly way to get them into a spinslash stunlock
here's a dumb question: it just me or armogohma quicker on the laser if you dont aim at it? or is that literally just me having had good luck?
for opening the eye to arrow I mean
a whole lot of loaded D20s got it
dont remind me about puppet zelda
when you just never get a ball its worse then a 10 blueball aga fight
which in itself is QUITE RARE if you hit your tennis
I mean - I am using the word tennis very freely given Aga fights in LTTPR dont have any semblance of that
and given that WW / OoT tennis you also got ways to counter the long ball exchanges
hidden crystal switch much game holy fuck KEKW
is that part of early MS shenaniganry?
one of the very select few instances where a story flag is not prone to crash your file if you did things slightly out of order
gonna dip...GL with the dragon phan!
(me pokin at when you do story flag skips in a game and then come back to the area on a later flag prog either resetting story order into softlocks or just straight crashing)
good snoozes to ya anni peepoCozy
I gotta say I wonder if the reason this game got so many water bomb refills is purely because during testing this game, they just were more convenient then normal bombs through and through
meaning once you have double clawshot, you do that and dont need to go all the way around the left section to get uppies and stop the turbine yourself
UCONN back to back champs boiii! Lookin good and solid.
which imma assume is a flag thing in rando based on having clawshot / double clawshot if that cutscene even needs to play?
cus last seed I was in here but the left side bridge was auto destroyed
Im doing well thanks. Got tired and didnt feel like finishing the seed cuz work is in a few hours lol
but yeah its fun. I tend to do no Rowf-4 blitz
early rather. I prefer to start at 6-6:30am EST
which I mean - makes sense that they do
oh ur skipping my fave fight
I dont really have words for the AMOUNT of story flags nintendo plays with for silly stuff like that
and how somehow most of them just fall apart on super silly stuff
HEYA PHANTOM! I just got off work, it's 10:43 PM AND I have to be at work at 7 AM tomorrow D: And probably work till 8:30 to 9:30 PM. I usually don't have to work till 2:30 PM, but 1st shift called off
it looked like an OoT style early frame Item pull thing as to where it didnt do what it was supposed to
like how in OoT if you target something for jump attacks as example or rang when the target reticle isnt there yet, the respective move just goes god knows where
the fact that the big one just fell down for no real reason made me nearly scream laugh
"I am done here" yeets off
Holy hell I hate shit like that where you have to be frame perfect
link stretch mc armstrong over here just extendo-grippin ledges
@Axl_SR you know ESS angles in OoT?
it basically makes holding those near 0 but not quite 0 inputs more consistent
i dont know anything about OoT
so think movement range of 0 (stand) to like 5 as an example is your ESS (just turn, no run) input
is that something leader board mods could easily detect?
and then above that you got your range for slow walk, walk, slow run, run
"better range of low value movements" perfect
plus (could be wrong there, not fact just a thought!) I think OoT as is has a slight bit more leniency built into the game v MM as an example
This is the fastest I've ever seen someone play that cinematic
how much was said disk LUL
thats not quite pokemon levels of expensive but wow
I bought a copy back in 2018 for $47 lmfao
i got lucky with mine, paid 60 for the disc and box last year
gotta be that Wii U store now being gone thing bringin the used prices up
surely one day ill get tp for a decent price
the homie sale is very real lol otherwise it would be way more
cus 2018 you also had TP HD on the Wii U accessible
if your willing to put up with wii controls you can get it for like 27 for the wii
I feel kinda bad owning a disc and never using it, but I also don't wanna get rid of it cause I might learn this someday lol
@JCog if only for a casual replay way down the line truly
you say that like you don't believe me Madge
@Jonxhas well I also own TPHD so OMEGALUL
@morpheus080 i got bad news and good news at the same time. I MAYBE taking a twitch sabbatical and being a Lurker only.
@JCog I MEAN CMON NOW KEKW
its not like the Wii U Wii U is a fun console to play on with its clunky brick of a controller
oh I love the wii u gamepad as a controller lol
it honestly feels so good to me
compared to the switch for me also - then again, I really dont like the forced menus on that existing cus "we have a 2nd screen"
fair enough, though I feel like it works really well for inventory stuff
I just dont like that interaction personally when you got a big screen to do things with
and things like pikmin 3 where part of your base controls is the touchscreen of the pad just to throw pikmin if you dont go Wii controls for it
shut up midna, no one asked for the grand tour of your homeland
then again my Wii U also always was a case of "HDMI more like HDMNah" and to this day I never looked too deeply into it
I also renember there havin been a bunch of Wii U's where the HDMI port was just borked out the box so no idea
people still have wii u? HUH
@blacktiger51 it makes for a good doorstop worst case - and it does do GBA stuff well last I renember hearing
I need my wii u for harvest moon lol
barring the lag going with using cannon I'd say personally that WW HD thing
been so long since i had a wii u
wind waker and yoshis wooly world is the only reason I still have my wiiU. GBi replaced any other reason I had LUL
@Axl_SR for me its also Pikmin 3 now that MM1 officially turned into a bricked by design piece of media
oh yeah mario maker got shut done didn't it
no one calls it super mario maker phanto274Smile
no more access to the levels people made, though at least the completionist brains out there proved nintendo wrong and completed every level before the shutdown
i wonder if someone will find  barrier skip in this game
remember when people wouuld toss out their game cases and keep all their disks in a single binder? What was wrong with those people?
stingiest handouts is mm it wants u to have 200 arrows and quadruple magic
whats this? you liked escorting in temple of time? Okay then, be my guest
timer being green makes every trick 3 times harder LUL
is hyrule castle shortened in rando?
I wish zelda would return to this formula
skyward sword was only 3 areas, felt more like hwo MM was structured
the whole game is lacking KEKW
not having zora armor is toxic af
well shit guess it time to reset Kappa
youd think defeating zont would destroy that force field
you know all ganondorf needed to do is hide 1 fused shadow in the castle
gonna call it hear, Ill catch hyrule castle another time
gn axl have a good one
oh yea the red ones hold out a LOT of pummeling
think its like 4 MS quick spins without great spin?
I remained in the Smash 3DS servers after an hour of shutdown and finally said goodbye to what was not a fun last time
I think you can get arrows in the arena and right before the BK door in the barrels?
not 100% on the before BK door
welcome into finale of tp ad.
I forgot that you could clawshot that truthfully KEKW
and I renember last time I had this happen to me, it was like a 10phase crapshoot
might be the pirate ways during the early days
this fight is jank as hell damn
@Curtissimo41 TaS rides right on ganon side by side
which riding right next to ganon is also kinda monkaS given he can just curve into you and throw you off
also I dont have to see it, I KNOW TP Link just forgets about quick spins somehow
orcris1Gg orcris1Gg phanto274GG phanto274GG pripcyGG pripcyGG phazon3GG phazon3GG avarie1GG avarie1GG majinPOGGERS majinPOGGERS First run leaderboard complete!
no clue how they messed that up coming from WW to here
with it being the same baseline engine behind it and all
best thing though: we got clankers credits
bye all thx for epic strim
Oh ok thought no numbers instead of items was strange
*Link holds up the master sword* I HAVE THE POWER!!!
Yo Phantom. hows it going bud
what is this get out of Bedge before noon thing
its 1 item over many to get a decent load of sphereage early
Hey I need that for my ootmm seed, can i have it
or do you have dungeon shuffle and kid only access to some eye switch checks?
in OoT its exactly 1 hard sling locked check
unless ofc dungeon ER as an example throws things your way
Hmm do i go full clear bottom of the well out of logic since i do have a key now
if you're out of other options? *shrugs*
since i can action glitch to deload the water
whether you should is its own beanbag
only cuz marioman need flash and it could be there
I would vouch for "only if you are stuck otherwise" personally, thats when I start doin dumb shit in randos (and if others are okay with it given what OoL shenaniganry can lead to)
espeeecially in OoT where the entire world is just an illusion if you know the specific places to stand and sidehop / roll / backflip box move yourself
nah nothing else i mean there are 2 checks in water temple since phantom did get me my irons but i will have to hookshot jump to get to shadow
logical glitched access only to shadow? p4ntzThink
yeah no warp song i been in there 2 times already
I mean is "did you enable glitched logic" for your seed
wanted to say, that makes more sense
i was told anything goes so
yea thats its separate thing I just was tryin to understand if you NEEDED to do glitched OoB entry towards shadow or nah
it do be a bit shnasty to get such a low items snowpeak
come to think, does TP truly only have 1 greg in the pool?
there's 1 from the uppies room in Hyrule Castle, and I do recall from when I had everything shuffled that I found 2
but neither do poes or agitha rewards add that
clawshot where you want it KEKW
Was also playing some TP rando, trying to learn it. Having lots of fun so far.
damn guess only Raven can do that
8th step up / 4th left hand up for those wonderin if you dont know this one
Which all Zelda games do you run? I seen you do Twilight, Minish Cap, and Link's Awakening, is that all?
and obviously not an Intended thing to do, just fuck goin around the cannonball trail PrideLaugh
what I am sad about btw: super cool theme here, but a superbly mediocre boss
that being said I am also kinda spoonfed in bossfight options coming from MM / OoT where you at times have MANY MANY options
that being said, I dont think there EVER is a way where TP's eco is NOT fucked right
capitalism has put lead in our lunchables
given the golden insect pool of cash ALONE just flatlines the entire operation in hyrule
I mean yea - but there's so much more cash just sitting around which no one ever picked up
at least in worlds like say OoT you gotta know where the hidden respawns are
time to get all the things and not help the bridge goron, pay the entire 2k raw KEKW
damn dead hand had nothing Sadge
looks like nothing to me KEKW
sadly it wasnt the didney park entry card, but the tax forms SadgeBusiness
this particular clawshot spot just annoys my head btw - would love to have a reason
One of my favorite mini games here
its better then izas boat ride
at least in this one you are allowed to control link
whaaaa you dont twant the HIGH SCORE?!
I swear that was one of the most annoying things nintendo ever did - adding a cheesy text to that to make people think there's a 2nd good thing on it instead of just money
So what do you have turned on for these settings
:) palace is dead to me
technically its just a fused shard barrier, similar in my head to a meds bridge in OoT truly
just adding the "race mode" WW feels to it in dungeons not marked as needed being fool entirely
Do you get told in the beginning which dungeons you have to do
logically the goron at ZD needs it
cus yu needing to emerge again
oh shit i have 1 check in gtg SadgeBusiness
no rang to LJA down to the chest is kinda sad PrideLaugh
HahaSweat  good that last check was nothing
Looks like you got alot for 1:30 in
Looks like alot of key items just no keys lmao
oh the longer i look the worse it gets lol, no boomarang is ROUGH for these
ur missing more than that no Runnzies
should be up to 5F or so only right?
and then there's the like 2 back in Snowpeak which you didnt get at the time
if this is a seed where you had to get clawshot for rod for something behind rod KEKW
I'd rather take the sketches to be a thing
I wanna say as much as this game has portals near most dungeons, I would take an Ooccoo change to this depending on possibility to be a between visited dungeons warp item
where you can choose the dungeon out of a menu based on ooccoo collection within the dungeon you want to go to
I mean at least you can full clear AG right
if link could ball&chain while roomba
its definitely something I have seen being done
what sucks is you cant just go straight sadly
the big wind up to rupees will never not be amusing
oh yea the one chest which on the map data of the game is marked on 2 floors for some reason
nintendo did it is all I can tell ya rly there
Funny u and marco are at the same part
in rando you dont need to talk to him here
once you beat a dungeon Ooccoo disappears even if not picked up in the dungeon beaten
had her set in 1 seed in my Forest, then went ToT and had her stand in the entrance there
yea thing for me was I had her set in forest
so no clue if ToT is dumb
I only know for a fact Ooccoo just yeets out of existence from a dungeon you set her up in if you beat a different dungeon
or rather hence my wish for Ooccoo to turn into either a warp choice based on dungeons + Ooccoos found combined
so say Snowpeak Ooccoo found = Ooccoo in inv for that area to warp into and from at your leisure
its definitely a bit of a dumb ManChicken moment
and I didnt say a thing cus I was doin somethin else + thought this instance happened already at some point HahaSweat
dunno - am definitely interested in a WWR style either warp spot you can interact with at any dungeon entrance for warping betwen visited dungeons or Ooccoo to not be lost on dungeon complete / marking the dungeons you found her in
so you can warp between dungeons better with her in Rando
cus this right nowo is definitely a counter to Ooccoo'ing out and then having to do a different dungeon
had a small net blip right when you were answering 😓
I guess my wish goes towards "if someone picks up multiple Ooccoos it fine" except current behavior of Ooccoo both vanilla and whats going on in rando atm hinders that if that makes sense
and yes, Ooccoo is most of the time just out of the way anyway - but stuff like Snowpeak is a long walk back from a dip as an example, so is Goron mines, Lakebed technically
its like what, 40s just to re-enter if you were to not have an ooccoo inside
Forest temple is a bit of a long walk as well even if its arguably the most "accessible" in terms of that
long story short: given that Ooccoo in casual brain let alone rando brain got its reasons to be possibly picked up, QoL Ooccoo makes sense
that being said no clue what all people thought about with ManChicken for TPR so far
and rando likes to do its chain shenaniganry
like - that seed I got in memo had me dipping 2 out of the 3 dungeons
Yooo Phantom good luck phanto274Smile phanto274GL
then you can at least skip directly to the important one
the sword could be in HC at least
all rly depends on item placement order rly, yea
be it a set order or a random order or whathaveya
cus for MM the reason songs on songs with no epona start in rando was a long haul of "oof" was because it had to place songs first obviously, then sprinkle items around that
and a WHOLE lot of the item order turned into "just go snowhead temple every time" realistically
and then based on item placement order within that, certain things just happened more often to the point where there was an entire discussion around that
SINCE WHEN CAN HE DO THAT KEKW
I never EVER have seen the moblin leader doing that
the worst would be if master sword is behind the 2 darknuts KEKW
these damage values dont make sense in my head holy shit
how can these not live a single bomb but 4 spins of master sword are fine
the thing I always go out of my way for before lanayru in casual vailla
also what is this health insurance ganon laid around in HC for you
I learned if I move stuff around on broadcast I also have to move the LCL settings. I wasnt hard to figure out but it game me a good laugh only seeing miracle water marked as out of logic LUL
how did the master sword fit in that chest?
now please a non-dominion rod locked BK
if you would be so kind
i just noticed this song is from link between worlds
also how, between worlds was after this game by a good while
its link to the past, but Ive only played that once so I associate it with LBW
that theme i dont think ever changed much since then
I havent touched hyrule castle since 2016 LUL
vanilla its a rooom full of refills
I mean are all those chests in vanilla
think there's every ammo set in there, every rupee type once
whats hilarious in vanilla is the fact that trove of chests is inaccessible unless you do the graveyard section of HC
cus you will end up 1 key short without that area
orcris1Gg phanto274GG avarie1GG pripcyGG stupid143GG phazon3GG majinPOGGERS
shit i miss the 3 second final boss
but what about a TMC rando? p4ntzThink
wouldnt those land in shorter time?
time to play more rebirth SadgeBusiness
id prob go watch that anyways lol
the thing on screen is lying
I was JUST thinking about the stream

why'd they take it away is my question
Brawl was the only game hammer was good LOL
I dont like the pit foot cam
You right my bad I'll just turn off the stream
if it was Palu, the cam would've been on her ass
Crush that co-op, Show them what's up
really love that Nintendo made a fanfic using they’re characters and turned it into a game
so why does diddys peanut gun explode when you charge it?
actually having a pb and J sandwich right now
you ever see the smash modded game where porky was playable
no clue why it just exists

That's why I needed to do it
what else should I do for splash phantom
should I cheer the pasta about wanting to fuck the no internet dinosaur
what map are you looking at that is very wrong
ok the call has told me to cheer it
in guides tab on SRC page has the image i made
Cheer100 kermit: Holy fucking shit. I want to bang the google chrome no internet dinosaur so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time my internet connection dies I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of her online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with the Google Chrome no internet dinosaur. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers
probably not worth to pull up now
Not knives walking in during this LOL
I am enlightening and I wish I wasn't
Was the splits already setup for olimar or did you make it that because it's jesses favorite character
everyone splits on each individual character
i need to delete them then lmao
after 10 years, TMC US is now sub 2
he pulled up giant and said fuck phantom in particular
I think it's better if falco isnt here
oh god did you go into checkpoint doors
you went into all of them, if you didnt then quit out strats are pointless
what guide are you looking at
is the image from IGN, that ones abysmal
oh nvm not doing a teleport to lucas after rayquaza was what confused me lol
Take me to dinner first taboo
So what is the brawl theme talking about
Yay getting a second go. Time for the victory runback
no lie........ i be forgetting phantom lives out here
im casting on friday evening so not then
because idk when i'll be done lol
still have to talk to dodie to be able to cast at the arena again
yeah, like no shade but like .... knockdown wasnt originally planned for this weekend nor was sns
and now both of them are happening
i get it....... i dont want to lose the only mk8 local
but same time im working to get other locals started
who ready for the first canonical death in smash
lucas' family backstory is fucked up
This zelda is mixing tf outta you
especially making the side b go on forever
and cant forget the better up-b AND BRAWL GLIDING
Gliding would be way cooler to time ppl out with than whatever the fuck that blue whore is doing
I dont want to fuck lucario
If you want to though I dont judge
I have never lost to a lucario that MU is dogwater
And I never will cause I dont touch that shit no more kazamsCatglubhappy
u both are cooking in this hr
@MegaJkeezy my feed is always 4 minutes behind.
4 minutes behind? shiiiiiiet then you should have seen the death
Better than you after what happened earlier today
I figured you werent but its funny
It was uhh, not very nice to look at, but its fixed.
that trainer has to be tired from running around in the background
Ngl old Charizard fair was cool
Jesse throwing, look at all this time loss
Or do you save and quit to save time?
This mode was mind blowing back in the day
So Jesse, when are you opening metafy for Brawl speedruns?
who sold more mvd or phantom
god damn it marioman i click redeem and it turn red Madge
@buff00n all fine and dandy on my end weather wise as well.
Xenoblade people, is it good / bad that whenever I boot up XC1, I get stuck into sidequests / grinding instead of prioritizing the story
yeah i had a feeling it was something like this for today
Cool, should be good to go now
I get to watch in 3rd person now peepoHappy
You must spend money to progress YEP
You can't do Fuzzies and Koopa Legends w/ just hammer?
Right, I knew jump was important, didn't realize you couldn't make it there
Watt is probably also logical Chan?
I had the wild idea to do a 3 blitz seed marathon race, after 1st card in 3rd seed I see you doing this and im hungry lol
I'm noticing a bit of stuttering, not sure if that's just stream or not... (hopefully that's not my code lagging the game...)
April is just the month of co-op speedruns huh
so is phantom's gamefeed on the left?
Oh, uh, let jokehow know Homeward Shroom is a thing that exists please
what rules are you playing? glitched logic?
oh, this is running auto tracker too
and you can buy palace key
can you see each other in game?
so both of you can just spend 15 to get the 30?
There's also the tree on the ledge, right?
oh i didnt know that specific partner upgrades were now part of the pool
do you need ultra stone for second upgrades
this seed is missing mirror mode LUL
youre one chance to make jokehow do mirror mode lul
This rando only has certified good setting (TM), lol
Jokehow, if you see mystery note dont skip it!! There are 4096 combinations LUL
Oh those blocks are in random spots lol
The puzzle skip is slightly harder now NODDERS
Mini Hammer / Jump 6FP per use
Invisibility unfortunately a bug in the rando with multiplayer on, nothing I can do about it
are trees randomized? JokeHow's been hammering them like a mad lad
Yeah, and I know why and have a hunch on how to fix it
More NPCs loaded than clover expected
@Icebound777 That was my guess too
Use the action command or spend some FP and let the game do it for you
Maybe one of these days I can port this to console Clueless
can you swap to sushie in the fight now?
hi, I lurk, it late, almost bedge
can you just toss items in the overrworld toe ach other?
toss an item at jokehow as he opens a chest KEKW
Desert panels and Mr. E now
Spin-jump on the second-last frame possible
joe can't get on a block LUL
Depends on what dungeon is there YEP
but the raised block climbing the mountain
@stavros12c34anenoglou Not a command but I gotchu
so we did the 3 blitz seeds race today
I quit half way thru seed 3 cause I wanted to see this LUL
it was fun and I did ok. but, the first seed absolutely was terrible. second was almost as bad, third was actually ok
It should update max FP but you'd need to heal
Also 3rd vanilla dungeon, what kind of rando
FP hasn't upgraded at all, hmm
Huh, weird that it was delayed like that
Most of the pause menu UI gets loaded when you press start, so changing the values afterwards wouldn't visually update
I wonder how (un)equipping FP/HPPlus would look with that
PhantomGamesBot were you paid off for dojo?
You can do them after CK, it's technically faster
love how quick it was to update
and the one outside toad town?
can you both do the same scripted fight at the same time?
We have seen a distinctive lack of cloud boy in this glitch logic seed
Now that I think of it, did you ever talk to Fice T when you realized forest was closed?
I forget, can you deliver the letter without Portrait?
Haven't actually seen this section without cutscenes, I suppose that makes it a little harder
They made a FFVII rebirth patch that changes the wording of the final boss
Before: Retry from Before current battle
I'm in chapter 10 for rebirth need to get back to it
Fun fact: you can cancel earlier if cutscenes exist YEP
oh jokehow, runis stones are shuffled too, 60 combinations LUL
Probably still need Dictionary to clear
my first seed I got red yellow red yellow red yellow so try that first
GAMBA is looking a little weak, where are all the GAMBA fans at?
ok im going crazy. im seeing a glowing toiletseat behind jokehow
i remember when jokehow had to actually call a locksmith
dont lag on power shock pls
no goombario jokehoDespair why even live
there was an nhl goalie the other day who said, 'i saved 39 of 40 shots, whatever we're all going to die anyway'
he plays for like the worst team in the league so it was very on brand
I saw that and wasn't sure if it was a real quote it so out of pocket
can you both withdraw the blue berry?
Congratulations to @Ohrocks for winning the pred
Have to be on the up part of laki's bounce too
NGL, like seeing the multiplayer-exclusive cheating too
Probably fight multiple basic Bloopers at the same time
Basically anything you could reasonably save scum solo, you can cheat in multi
You could laki clip in fortress and use the same key on different doors
i guess tubbakeys too if someone want to do that dumb glitch
you talk the flower on the left side of the room
Do you pick up the Pyramid Stone now or skip it? You have the option now
oh yeah koot a thing and you might not need to do it
Big Brain Question: If drop Star Points is on and phantom runs from a fight can Jokehow steal their star points? phanto274Thonk  Cheer100
Noticed it on the raids earlier too
Hope you're having a great stream!
You earn yourself a follow lol
the lag makes it fun for us LUL
Curious what your PC specs are
did you remember flowerr fields panels?
I forgot what area is this
Did Jokehow ever go back for Mayor Penguin bucket check?
Curious what the timer's based on
If it's based on in-game time, it's possible it started in the negatives
at least he is at ultra rank
clippy boots on that controller COPIUM
I see volcano vase isnt handed in yet
i wanna have it iwanna play it with sombody
good thing you just got ispy
you can go check all the panels :)
mhh, did you guys do the thing where you talk to merlee
There's one in the yellow(?) Yoshi room
If you wanted to send the log to me, I could peek and also make sure you didn't miss anything important
did you talk to fice T?
Oh depending on how you mapped it, it may only register notched angles
I wanted that to be ddolly
are there any partner checks that were skipped like with parakarry?
What jumpless does to a person
there is a panel on the right side
In your defense, you couldn't jump at the time
doesnt mario have emotes in this?
joe do you want to buy pulse stone
what about the save block trick?
i can get oob here on emulator pretty easy but doing the skip nah
The pedestal should be at the bottom of the screen
NOTED joe is bad at laki jumping
NOTED cant laki jump but ultra hammer skip EZ
Might have duped Misstar if Joe did LP skip too
one of you could just wait at shooting star summit LUL
That does work if 2 players touch the card, not sure how it works in ch5
Someone duped Skolar on the first public MP
also I know this was missed earlier, been lurkin since basically beginnin of seed PrideLove is this some ML64 style shenaniganry or AP related things?
I made a multiplayer client for PM rando in BizHawk
@Axl_SR yea that is what I had thought, hence the ML64 (modloader) thought
cus thats the most common I saw people use for that (as much as it broke lots cus ofc)
gotta say though (as much as I dont necessarily like biz) hearirn its biz makes me think its more stable
does that even work for like power bounce
enjoying seeing Mario do Naruto's Shadow Clone Jutsu
awwww star points not synced papeHands
but the red jar code LUBBERS
see - I get it, cus I bet star points are part of inventory
but it would make for funny
what if there was a way to clip into windmill loading zone?
I think it would be easier from a technical standpoint to sync the current badges than to lock them out
BC I probably could sync equipped badges if I wanted to
ya got starry hill star'd PrideLaugh
couldnt you cheese an extra level out of it
Potentially gain a level at the expense of whatever resources used during the fights
If one of you has extra items, you can toss them too
watching the 4 hour sm64 invis wall video see you on the other side
imagine skipping stanley but not twink
Phantom's quick on all the menus
thanks for the 100% speedrun :)
how much laundry did you have???? a 3 hour folding session…
so i got 1 shot by a summon in rebirth and was like yeah gonna go back to the story
what the fuck is that following you
And Mega Rush, damage will never be lacking
What kind of sphere 0 even is this?
i need a mod that makes it possible for mystery bags to give an item when used
I guess one where we get to use WeLoveGoombario for a but so I shouldn't complain too much
actually that would be cool if that was a thing
The speedrunner is all alone again
also i want a mod where in boss fights you can only use goombario as a partner
Then you're flying to new orleans, right?
Would you wanna do comms for my SMRPG run for Retrothon on tuesday? lol
It's at like 6:30 my time, so 4:30 yours
right numbers wrong order tiger lmao
phanto274GL beestGLGLGL marcoGL orcris1GL avarie1GL phazon3GL marcoGL_HF
hiya hows it going so far?
WeLoveGoombario have a use in this seed
you sure u want to leave that
we a 5 fp power shock right
great lookin start so far with the buddies
also didnt know if I should or nah, but now bein a dummy: what was that example code snippet thingy you had sent in rando abut? p4ntzThink
just a fix to a specific check or example stuffß
what I'd vouch for is a toggle similar to the poes for the sky characters
yea the rando does, but I havent seen a single maptracker accounting for Bonk Damage 🤣
like for ANY bonk damage logic rando I mean for that instance, not just TPR
plus you're also already lookin into glitched logic / easy trick OoL access inclusion in regards to things like say LJAs
which in and of itself is a LOT
even more a lot if you were to look at quick spinner
which - sounds like more headache then worth for a overall mostly content setting
quick spinner is 100% OoL extra shenanigans
you could do the Lantern Irons chest entirely with it ignoring irons in there similar to LJA method rly
stuff like that is what comes to mind, where LJA's go downward in platforms rather then staying smae height
so like lower Eldin / Kak Gorge HP chest
but as said, its a pure "haha funny" QoL setting according to the mouseover
and bonk damage imo absolutely is more of a content then "everyone plays this" setting + I assume its a long haul from Random settings accessibility with TPR
@ThePinkReaper nah, my bad PrideLove Twilight princess Rando
sorry for the confusion of the acronym
TP is an awsm rando but do u activate twin items on urs?
do you mean plentiful item pool?
like 2 chances to find balls boomerangs klaws and boots with spinners
yea thats "plentiful item pool" settings
I guess it would be fine if there's a massive item pool of checks to go through? but TPRando dont have that much going even with inclusion of all the bug / poe checks respectively and not joking a single thing
(kinda glad that it dont have digspot / pot / freestanding rupee shuffle on the other hand, cus man would that be a LOT of pots alone)
like - to me those plentiful pool settings have a better "gel" sync feel if you were to have a big item pool
but unless I am far off, TPRando has like what, maybe 400 checks?
should be 0 1 2 3 4 5 or 6
I mean I could but I dont wanna copy into notepad++ and then line count PrideLaugh
what also kinda stinks for the current dungeon reward stuff (which I think is the reason you have the Zant Heart container junked on yours) is that a fused shard landing on that specifically = haha lul AD
similar ish with arbiters except thats not having to do a dungeon to do a dungeon
what COULD broaden the field somewhat (if people felt like it) would maybe be the inclusion of side dungeons (realistically boiling down to cave of ordeals)
which THEN you need a bucketlist of things just to get to floor 50 for a shard / mirror piece
my fave torture item is if last fairy visit in coordeals
then again that gives auru's notes even bigger value there
cus rn its "just" an extra item check and if you need / shuffled poes, those in there
me just yesterday on that note getting super early aurus with 1 rod, to get irons, zora shirt, clawshot, 2nd rod AND rang all in the desert before arbiters
while I had to do Lakebed, goron mines, snowpeak
snowpeak rly boils down to "keysy? go left and up, skip the cheater LJA that way if bombs / ball, rush about
and I gotta say that I just dont want to do the iron ball escort, so I need to say thanks to you for the speedruns ya did of it cus ladder cheese is so juicy
hell - that very seed right
she ACTUALLY gave me the key when first talkin to her
where you normally get snowpeak map
she was like "oh yea lesgo" 🤣
i seen it in ch4 could of been the block
*shrug* ended up halfway fullclearing the place still cus neeed double clawshot for HC anyway
but just being handed the key by the one searching for the key is some prime forgetfulness KEKW
no you pick it up i check the vod
"oh I cant get into my warehouse, but can you please by this here warehouse key which I dont know whom it belongs to? it DOES look oddly familiar"
you did was a dizzy dial
I'm in the process of rewatching all the paper mario runs on YouTube
didn't know u can clip back
the shy guy spawn animations take forever
That's true. Guess I didn't think of it that way
Lets be trucking along these spikes
if the desert music was a bit better I think I'd like those checks a lot more
I sometimes skip the attack fx check in the bottom corner
excuse me streamer… you have the OP partner highlighted but isn’t currently out to support.. why’s that?
Yo Phantom, gl and how's the seed treating you?
Ah rando, when it's okay and then it's not Sadge
did you already hand in volcano vase?
Hopefully it's not all you have to sushi glitch everywhere phanto274Bless
oh fr I never knew that
could be the upgrade on the mountain 🤷‍♂️
Are you doing anymore seeds after this?
is it possible to first strike these clubbas?
What are you missing that's required?
Oh gotcha, just joined and heard "Got to go look everywhere."
anything locked behind red berry? that's was in ch3 shop
I think it was ch7 shop?
It'll be funny if it's the Dolly that has the key.
Still need the Moles, Dolly, Record... and maybe Mail, i think?
Can the star piece shop have the key?
the one after the 3 blue pipes?
check where record is too lol
mood, this was me in the weekly race earlier r
I just heard the game over noise while on big lurk, whu happen?
some item which sat in some weird locale?
"the fun time when your puzzle loses one piece waaay outta the way in the garage" PrideLaugh
Ok revenge runback of our lives. LetsGetIt
ultra boots chests or the forest?
ooookay this seed is trollin with that item placement 🤣
How funny, star stone and palace key first two items.
"hey renember this item you didnt have last seed? have it FOR FREE now!"
doesn't move the needle much early though :/
but the more "closed in" any rando seed is, the more easy it is to figure out v broad open starts
chasing icerods around is never fun
and which therefore can pretty much be anywhere, yep
I'll have to remember that one, didn't know you could do it with parakarry
oh cool boots and hammer man
I did feel like there was a large skip in rando features at one point, that was probably that break
but I'm fine with whatever you upload, it's all good sleeping content to me
i can backseat until you good at it
what button is it to toss items away like that?
good guess. clearly a good rando player.
Ultra gear in 20 minutes? Baby seed confirmed
Damn I can't believe how long I've been watching you
speaking of that its almost been 2 years since i started watching you god damn why did the time go
Aug 2022 here, potentially from an M4 raid, idr
This is the second most viewed Pape channel in my watch time, despite not currently being followed.
USually, when JCog isn't live, Twitch will suggest your channel if you're live.
@DreamcatcherSky why else wouldnt it be best streamer in town.
u both make the best duo
it's still not too late to go back to Merlin's for Slow Go
they hate to see bombette actually being good
i know there 2 for sure
i cant wait for rebirth to be over
i do really like this area i am in tho
i almost have 100% in this area
Someone stole Goombaria's doll and sold to the highest bidder. The monsters.
cant wait for part 3 so we can do it again YEP
they fix the mini game glitch for the platinum
also not re playing this game on hard i can do it but do i want to no
GL with the rest of the run, I'm off to bed ✌️
three phase boss fights feel like a slog, 8 is WAY to much
no lie i would of switch difficulty to easy if that happened to me
point is, it's WAY longer than it needed to be
Square Enix STILL hasn't learned what a "Skip Cutscene" button is?
i died on 1 boss fight and power went out on 1 boss fight
I bet thats annoying to speedrun
how down ferocious would someone be to speedrun Rebirth
ouch hes holding your fish hostage!
and you will probably have to use the thing that switch your hp for mp if you going for world record
Most games that are ultra-long to speedrun allow breaks in the rules
its really good if you don't get hit
yo phantom! how goes the rando?
Isn't there a character in this game that does that same thing?
still coping on Visions of Mana being decent
are turn based speedruns generally harder?
i play it like a turn based since i don't use shortcuts KEKW
No clue if I'd like that, wasn't a big fan of Xenoblade's combat
seems like they would be cause seems like they would have more RNG
someone said earlier that FF7 was just a pissing contest between cloud and sephiroth about if length or size is better.
yeah i got hit once by doing it
@venturific some games have bosses with static rotations you can plan around
i wonder if i will like ff 16
hey that's only 14h if you're good
I did so much sidequesting in XC1 I'm JUST reaching chapter 2
i got it on sale for 40 bucks
I'm ok with dmc games by no mean my fav
XC1 is probably like 150 hours if you're doing 100%
FF16 has graphics that made my brain hurt and gameplay that did the same
I made a huge mistake tonight playing TP, and it made me full clear my seed
is that a good thing, or a bad thing?
Which one had the boy band on a road trip?
someone described ff15 as a boy band, and I can't unsee that comparison
edgy because he has like 15 different weapons?
16 was good. had a decent story line and super fun fights. creepy last boss
i will try 16 next month
but nothing out-edges Stranger of Paradise's Jack
people give 10 a lotta shit, but I liked watching my brother play through it
I didn't think DQXI S was very grindy
ah i see we have pineapplester today
I love the fusion ff games like kh and the movies 5 times better than the games
I mean there's a difference between grinding and literally doing the same thing again for a third of the game
in dragon quest 8 and 11 just farm metal slimes for like 30 mins then you good lol
I guess I got lucky then. I even had the Draconic rule that prevented me from grinding
in 11 you can use pip power to summon metal slimes and get double xp took like 8 fights
thank you for choosing not to harm the slimes, this will be remembered during the uprising
i was just typing that lol
I tried DQ 9, couldn't get into it cuz I was a nameless, faceless asshole directing a buncha of nameless assholes I made up to fill out my party
I don't even remember how/where I got it
i seen a speed run of 11 true ending and he killed the final boss at a really low level
dude was in his 30s i was like HUH
i was level 99 and final boss wipe the floor with me
TURN THE WHEAT OF YOUR WEAKNESS INTO THE FLOUR OF POWER
i don't mind post game grind
Profit is to be made by grinding.
I am forced to grind Deer and Elk in skyrim for antlers, and goats for horns.
you will probably like dragon quest 8 don't need to grind
not really only in botw and totk is that the case with golden poop but u get diamond armor or weaponry in grinds.
I don't mind the grind, honestly.
I grind in Dragon Quest XI because the enemies are fun to fight.
50 to 99 in dq11 take like a hour ish
I bought Witcher 3, and have only played the first half hour despite owning it since 2018.
i own it on xbox one but no longer have a xbox one KEKW
I am in need of grinding Gold Data Cards in Grounded.
i did use double xp in persona 4
in DarkSiders u need the souls and lucky for u u can warp and reset places.
I bought VA-11 HALL-A despite loathing visual novels only cuz I REALLY liked the game's soundtrack
I wanna try bug fables. My ex played it and we broke up, I got the switch and still haven't tried it out
i still need to play all the yakuza games only got to 1 and stop cuz i was sick last year and never went back
said it before, but if you're gonna make a game to replace the thing I love, you HAVE to be on your A-game cuz I'm comparing it to the inspiration the entire time
There's only two places I grind in Wrath of War, one little alleyway with many spiderlings I used to level up my big fist weapon, and then the spirit riders in the Ashlands which you can manipulate the number of riders by climbing up and down a shaft repeatedly to get more riders, and thus more souls.
that's part of the reason I can't get into A Step From Eden, it's too visually ugly compared to BN
there were a couple times I watched someone playing Bug Fables and thought "that's why Pape and TTYD didn't do that, cuz it's awkward af"
yeah, I'm NOT a fan of rougelites
i really wish i can walk around as a different character in rebirth its forcing me to play as x character right now
there are good rougelites, but I prefer a refined, defined well-crafted gameplay experience instead of rolling the dice being the main / only draw of the game
there's not another Barret-only thing is there?
guess I'll find out for myself in about a year when it comes to PC
i would be fine with it but let me walk around with who i want too
then after the puzzle you switch
someone was complaining about a fight coming up on fb
well I'm off to maybe finish the base P5
depends on how long this palace is T_T
I'm just in what looks like is the palace
yeah, I looked up a guide for that to make sure I didn't miss out
30 seconds of click here? 🤔
you see in reload that fix when the dlc come out u can just play it
my brother's waiting for the re-release of Reload
when they bother to add FemMC
Ok I set up my yaml if you're still up to do a rando link tomorrow phantom
I realized I just literally didn't save it last time
I also turned off expensive purchases cause that's broken
I have a fat sphere 0 I'd probably? get you something quick
Or you can just dance around for a while and have a grand ol time
my net shit out back now
I also turned on death link
So you should do that too it'd be funny
I have no sword and combat caves so
I'm so powerful with this emote
first impression of Dunban, he should've been in Smash instead of Shulk
I did EVERY available side quest until I couldn't do side quests anymore
where he fucks himself up even more using the thing
my chat window just cuts that line of text so I just see "2nd time where he fucks"
this is such a fun dungeon Kappa
It will stay that way forever

I forget the way to break megan normally
that's all the bits im doin
black text and brown notes, very odd stream, yet par for the course
my like 20 dollars I get from my tax return
I somehow got just under $180
at this rate, I'll be paying next year, I guess
nah, they take taxes from me, trust
we managed to get a pretty large back, but we won't see any of it due to student dept that went to collections
idk what you said, was in ads
yeah i'm not elligible for any kind of forgiveness because it's not technically a student loan, and i'm not able to take out a student loan until it's payed off
basically i just was so burned out from my last semester that i forgot to set up the payment on time and got put in limbo for it
I really need to get college going but I'm so scared of that shit
@RavenFP I'd recommend community college, marginally cheaper
That's what i already planned on
I got a medical bill dismissed cuz I proved I couldn't afford the damn thing
at this point my plans for college are to not finish
$10,000 for a visit about a rabies shot, foh
I once got a bill from the doctor, cuz I hadn't been to the doctor in a while, prior to that visit
at this point, I'll just endure the pain, cuz fuck those bills
My pastor brought his kidney stone to church today
fuck it, if I die, I die
what side did u say it was on?
He did it to make some sort of point about sin
@buff00n I don't remember but our church has youtube vods now so I could check
i love living in the age of modern medicine. i'd like it more if i was allowed to use it as well but whatever
it would probably be cheaper to fly to canada to go to the hospital
if I require actual, life-saving medical treatment, I'm going out of country cuz that shit's more affordable
I've seen too many stories of people having emergencies out of country, which can be summed up as:
I paid $20 for a 3-week stay hospital stay after life-saving surgery
health care should be free worldwide
not when your priority's making money
i've been having some pain lately that has brought me to the point of just not being able to do anything, but i'm extra fucked because it's dental
omg i just realize that jesse KEKW in the  FeelsBirthdayMan
dental insurance: for when american health insurance isn't enough of a joke
last dental visit I tried to tell the dentist that I had a tooth pulled, and something grew back in it's place, but he refused to believe me
like, mother FUCKER, I was THERE when they yanked that shit OUT
Hmmmmm First and Last time chadders
@RubixTheSlime How i truly am mesmerized by phantoms presence and soul.

FF7 Remake uses experimental new party changing mechanics where Tetsuya Nomura decides your party members at all times

Gonna have a boba place in walking distance of me soon so we'll see how that goes
it's time to defeat the browser
first we must know what kind of browser he is today. best case scenario he's in an IE mood and just defeats himself
you never know he might be in a netscape navigator mood
its also didn't help i had like no moves for him since i haven't used him
one day he'll surprise us with curl
that is enough rebirth for the night time to watch final then Bedge

Did they add wind waker to archipelago or is this a different thing
hi, I got the full pain bingo today, so I'm gonna go to bed real soon but happy birthday and have fuuun

most in game nicknames are reserved for Twilight princess.  OOT and MM not so much.
i was doing so good today
strength would open a bit too
matt censored my perspective of the finals from
I confused that with rock smash, just ignore me
he said the capture card didn't actually record anything
Bring back shaggy screaming zoinks when he falls into a hole
just the fact it locked behind someone e4 is so toxic
weird coincedenve that the other person at my setup also used inward
Isnt it a little early for you
Ahh that's fair. How goes it
you could grind levels while waiting LUL
CANT STAY forgot my phone charger at school but if y'all still going later I can be back runera3Pat
well it does have a horn
Need to go to the bank now, to make my deposit and also pay for CB
Hey I've done it before and it's worked twice on a friends stream
OH before I forget I can't start now but anytime u want to start laying out what u want for the art thangs lemme know
So I can start planning what to draw
the worst part about Deli thus far is the chickens
ain't NEVER been this consistently hungry on the clock before
these birds smell so damn good and they're juicy af, comin off the skewer
a surfing moltres now i seen everything
@stavros12c34anenoglou surfing entei with sacred fire, that, shadow punch and psychic though... paperLurk
totally not what my first seed of this was like
do wanna say btw phantom that there is a map pack for AP side which has the extra settings of it reflected on i t
so like extra boulders as an example - it doesnt have the most recent stuff (so berries, trainers) yea
berries and trainers both are beta / RC side rn
musta been me not havin seen the thingy whatsitcalled broadcast view ever then
for hoenn its too small in my head
my brain was lookin at "wait whu where's that"
not that its necessarily NEEDED on the broadcast view 90% of the time
no free fly or fly start either is rouuuuugh for Emerald imo
suuuuuper restricted early in without the badges
Dang, this is not the kind of title you see every day.
Also, Toad is there KEKW KEKWait
in my head the best "solver" to that is shuffling everything then having extra bumpies, boulders, rocks
but you cant really devalue surf too easily
unless someone were to make a "surf for free" option which also kinda flatlines it hard
what you COULD do (imo) is start with HM02 and a random fly locale + fly without badge
though that can still easily create funky scenarios of itself
worse is things like having fortree or fallabor
then sittin there having to reverse the map on foot 7 different times from there
to that I rly only have "no base exp curve fuck that"
my ch3 scale 7 jr i was force to fight at level fucking 2
ez way raven: roll one direction on ice, then other way round
well... thats magma and aqua emblem
yea AND without rocksmash / strength you cant go into hideout anyway
strength puzzle at the entrance, no?
raven not wanting pear juice w droppings
I dont have one phantom CorgiDerp
waiting for your post E4 Safari to have like ravens hookshot
cus thats a thing without settings to change safari workings
its silly to have that fight with random doubles and him havin a bunch of rattatas
I dont want to be a drowzee 🤣 fuuu
well I guess it makes sense KEKW
dont worry about a floaty ball
@Jonxhas i been a hypno before Madge
@blacktiger51 I dont like hypno line okay
"that wont do a thing" karma KEKW
I'm so confused lol why does toad actually fit in 🤣
let just hope it was nothing important
tryin to find their pin to it, cus it sounds like there might be a workaround
but I cant seem to find the FAQ channel they got
The anthem of the day: Break My Stride! Good luck on this run
for rockspire beedle the only real "workaround" atm is to give the items supposed to be there
known issue when all (or some?) of the items being sold in the shop are the same
if you want me to, I could quickly skim the spoiler for the 3
then name them in dms to ya?
just wantin to throw in a "derp me like help" thought is all
for reference how the give item thing would work though phantom: !giveitem command
i could beat my seed but i have to do something really dumb
which if its like the "send_multiple" which I have used for repels for someone in emerald before / escape ropes too
then it should be !giveitem <player> <item>
on the room page for the one who rolled (ik you said it fine just wantin to throw the info out) PrideLove
its would be really funny if my longshot was on 1 of the bugged checks
allows for super whacky item send zombie hovers
"yo send me a heart piece!"
you just mash til you're where you want to be though raven
just get a fairy drop Kappa
the only reason why it even popped up in my brain is because I have played LTTPR with people who like doing superbunny
and whenever they do its fueled by "send us items I dont care what!"
maybe your DRC map is just on the boss?
also sorry, didnt see the entirety of the seed so didnt know if you full cleared
you didnt have bombs before didya
no I mean for DRC map
what if its in one of the 2 tingle chests in there
this... looks like an interesting strat
the boss just floating above the warp 🤣
its all to open up the charts KEKW
who knows what junk you got on that
also shouldnt there be a mail by expensive beedle
or did that not specifiy the items?
could swear he does mention them
I mean it would be IF (this being an OoT wishful thought) stuff like hammers or hooks in this instance IF for a different game still show as the respective in world item
so say, hookshot for OoT / other zeldas would still show as a hookshot
it has rod in the name
but yea - I guess the big hindrance is a lot of randos just use the GI text
and therefore it just turns it into AP items via that
on the text side I mean
which - I cant rly say that I could call that a bad solution, just that it might be in the way of edited texts for this
the ONLY game I know of which doesnt do the AP item thing is OoT
SadgeBusiness i need to get back to throwing boxes soon
I mean raven - here's the thing
every rando seed unless raced is automatically a WR
watching the recent Coney video, heard "Mario Galaxy is the worst 3D Mario" and sure enough, I saw you in chat
watching the recent Coney video, butted "Mario Galaxy is the butt 3D Mario" and butt enough, I saw you in butt
I'm not a mod here? Huh
the ONLY enemy it cant easily deal with afaik is darknuts
then all the way other side for the bed chest
stupid shittin net threw a 1k+ ping
dont know how much higher, just that it was past 1k
yea at that point there were still very random 50s in between
which local rn ping is at like the high 10s to low 20s
I wiiiish I'd know how that'll hold up in the near future though
me over here sitting there with the worst seed luck
just imagine leaf up at helmaroc king, only having hook and grapple
whatever, you get what I mean
whats this, helmaroc king impersonating as articuno?
did you maybe start with 1 of them but not both?
also you didnt fight PG at FF
so like... could be that he has map
or compass* the thing you're missing
on a diff note though raven nfor curiosity: do you have tingle chests shuffled?
cus for DRC that could explain your compass / map missing thing
it absolutely could be that that ends up being map / compass if you junked them yea
cus the statues I reckon would have to be in the pool right
yea then the chests are shuffled
so there's your explainer for dungeon map / compass kerfuffles where it came up so far
cus how would you get the statues if they'd be in non shuffled and junked vanilla chests
just thinkin given that I KNOW for a fact say if you start with a HM in emerald (cycling back to the HM fly free fly fly locale start there)
if you start with an item its still got a dupe in the pool
despite it on paper not needing to do that
same with KH2 and its things
so there's some funky stuff going on there which in respective solo rando cases shouldnt happen and I dont think does
aka long and short: me not surprised if AP just takes the entire item pool as is for "base settings" and then excludes the tingle chests as an example again in post from being logically able to do a thing
why do you have the windwaker
phantom simply needs to become skilled
rock smash also still missing 🤣
and technically knuckle badge + flash
not having the nyoom bike also
lottery rupees noise stuck in ravens head
cus you dont want to do this again 🤣
honestly I have played so much rando where I just start with map+compass cus fuck extra junk in my dungeons
like - at least keys do a thing
as much as it in most cases is just doing the thing of adding haha lul roundabout routes
gotta say that early rupee recog on self found items just now for ya threw me off a bit raven 🤣
when you opened the chest with the 2hundo and it played the noise before the GI animation was done
*me sitting in a corner not wanting to manage inv in emerald much starting with 50 max repels* yea 60 super repels in a multiworld scenario could be not enuff
this toad mod is gonna make me commit murder tbh
although that's not really anything special
emerald to me has too many options of fucko mode routing
hell first seed me go free fly locale, find fly early -> fallarbor to backtrack to lavaridge and such, then frontwards to slateport and back again
cycles back to "fly is HUGE convenience"
my only reason of having free fly with fly start, then the free fly locale is just extra "fuck surf" momentum
sorry, I mean soup master sword moment
Portillos???? is there one up there?
or are you making the drive?
is it faster to take damage from those or are you fucking up and i can mock you?
I just woke up, how's progress?
might be trying to fill your wallet with every single rupee on the title screen?
so might be needed to be done by person who genned
its part of settings on seed gen
you can also release a persons seed I think
but I dont renember the command for that
just rock smash / waterfall away
couple room keys there were, basement key was
the good ol "and that is why you release responsibly" PrideLaugh
aka my reason for manual release after goal
cus I've seen people get stunned by items being sent at ganon in OoT (normal damage) at 15+ hearts and getting knocked to 0
this seed just cries for fly starting item 🤣
even if you dont have a random fly locale
but when phantom was doing it no fly
behind the magma / aqua kerfuffle
so phantom got grounded by the magma / aqua grunts from flying to the towns he's been at
would need to be badgeless fly + start fly then though
not to mention Fly UNLESS free fly locale is ALWAYS a QoL badge
and only a necessity for E4 unless you turn down the amount of badges
up to you gonna play rebirth anyway
what was it doing maybe i need to do smth like that
WOULD NOT PUT IT PAST EM FR
phantom this boss is killing me
It's been half an hour and i haven't seen phase 2 yet
I have hit the 2nd health bar for the first time
I'm so glad these yoshis shut up
Ok back to the brick wall I go paperLurk
Ohrocks do you wanna watch this shit
I prolly wont mic but you wanna see this damn fight
dirt is pretty easy to find its just outside
you can beat the game early by saving the yoshi babies
its called a good person run
Which rogue energy flavor is mario dressed in tonight?
Yesss the brown smudge stays behind
I think I figured out what to do for each part
I just need to execute very hard movement shit
Here to continue my presence streak but gonna take a wee break. Hope u and everyone is a goody
Are you doing more seeds after this?
i did a Majoras mask rando yesterday. Max settings. GOt like 80% of it done in 7 hours and stopped lol
Grass. pots, fairys and keys and rando
so every grass pot and fairy was a check
some people do it  linked with OoT and those settings
Memory shroom, is that the mushroom that warps you back to your spawn?
Wait is this full entrance randomizer?
Wait no, sorry I wasn't paying attention lol
heck, I basically woke up to the end of the seed
hope you're well, seed was good? what was memory shroom about?
love btw that goombari-who didnt make it into the team PrideLaugh
multiworlds are generally excluded from redeems, right?
would on the other hand beta settings be off the board?
were they? last I renember it was just an RC
musta been within the last 7 days or so then
anyway, would that sorta shenaniganry be something you'd be fine with given emerald has like 300+ trainers total and it will litter the seed with money items
or would that be too much?
lemme still peek into something though before I make a decision on that
Wait are we doing another run I'm confused?
cus I think I can mess with it to a specific subset meaning (have messed with the yamls for AP a bit here'n there
and I'd rather like to first confirm possible settings outcomes then just "press random haha lmao get dunked on"
so here's the potential thought on trainershuffle phantom: junking every evil team / gym battle for Emerald trainershuffle ?
or rather: any gym battle which isnt a gym leader*
overworld and routes + gym leaders / flag required fights yea
so say, example case being the magma lead fights where you got flags anyway
o7 will first nail that set of settings down before commiting any pressings of buttons then
cus I did do starting items / local only items, but havent done junking of locales much yet
dummy question on the type / ability / move shuffle for mons p4ntzThink
if abilities, I'd exclude wonder guard, arena trap, shadow tag from appearing given force fights in the wild = bleh
Wait what was in the shop
So I'm guessing the reason why we hoped it was chapter one or two scale because the fright jar might not have worked
Also don't you still want the janmmin jelly
They're like oh you want an item have the one you just dropped
Is really only lava piranha sometimes worth having a snowman doll
hey you have enough fp to d-down jump, use that :)
dummy question: the Mt Pyre Grunts are part of a flag set or nah?
but blind trainers is a setting
and if I go and junk the gym trainer rewards skipping them is only a thing with that
i just did ace in emerald to trigger hof, funny stuff
yea I think I need to take these settings for a spin in active playtesting then
cus I wanna make sure there's no weird inconsistencies like that specifically on those grunts - another example are the ones at the mossdeep space station with the magma grunts there
it saves, brings you back home afterward, and gives you the trainer card star, but doesnt bring you to postgame or anything like that so i still just have 5 badges lol
cus I know SOME of them are required given you otherwise cant do the double with steven
but there's more trainers listed at the space station then those 3
and as said: gym trainers barring leaders junk only makes sense to pull off WITH blind trainers enabled
cus otherwise places like fortree gym or mossdeep gym become painful to traverse for no real reason
inconsistency in the setting = me no like though :D
Is it only one because red yoshi is cooking item and mail chain
tldr: I need to go through this fully, test and see which ones ARE effectively still needed fights at those places
which is easy to do, worst case I could plando myself a free fly to mossdeep with 100 rare candies, bump the starter to max then look
I did hear it lol then my ad started
on somewhat related note to my rambling though: junking checks in emerald is relatively easy meaning I COULD go through the list of route checks and turn off the benny hills routes as an example if I wanted to
I can see the argument HOWEVER there's the ship
and the routes past lilicove / around that area you also have the trigger for the weather wars to end to set
Dive for ship and sootopolis right
(meaning more grunts to look through)
124 connectin to 126, 125 got a couple* yea
I do have a semi interactive map for emerald which I use for those
cus then I can see the entire thing with zoom in and out and approximate (I know that that isnt part of game)
counter argument to that: make that specific subset of checks "less" annoying by means of hidden items (but junking ALL the hidden items outside that area)
that being said I did see you not wanting those
definitely can see your point yep
the reason my brain was like "hidden items on dive routes is fine" is cus most of them are in the dive areas either by dark shadow or single rock
Like the 3 right next to petalburg city
and no gen3 item finder is dookie
it just turns you towards the cardinal the item is at roughly
Gen 4 I think is the start of the arrows
gen4 has arrows and a closeby radar
if it would be modded gen3 item radar / -finder, it would be fine
Two vanilla in that bunch lol
cus then you get it as a visual like gen4
with a star icon if you stand on it
gen2 has had less active modding overall no?
anyway: I can look through the items on those routes, HOWEVER for that dive interaction towards items I got no promises to make
because dive is what makes surf less potent on that set of routes imo
however you also need waterfall anyway + have items behind it (I get your point) p4ntzThink
it definitely a beanbag - first I need to figure out the trainers though
cus like - the one NPC on the routes south of mt pyre requiring you to have a grass type for the check is also annoying to do if shuffled encounters
like - I get it if the issue is decoupling the giving out the item from that for some reason
at the same time, that sounds like actor behavior
and that should in theory not be hard to figure out
cus its not like we havent seen custom actor behavior
I dont recall any other NPC in emerald being like that
anyway: that one will go onto the junk list for pure "fuck this" reasons
and I THINK given dex shuffle is a thing, Emerald should be doing what you just said
aka making sure dex is catch / -evolvable
cus otherwise how would you implement that setting safely ever
you cant guarantee a convenient grass type at the least
like - it could be shit like a 5% encounter somewhere in the safari on normal catch rates being like celebi
which while "its available" also "fuck the odds"
on the note of that, I will just flat make them free
by setting you can make the catches guaranteed, but not by ingame methods
as for the reason: that'd be like requiring OoT Chest game without lens
which is arguably not the worst example given its a 1/32 but still
better example: it'd be like vanilla Dampe behavior of OoT in rando
no one would ever want that check shuffled if it was random placement
and while from a raw "gameplay loop" argument where one could say there's an incentive to say "oh this thing I want is hard to get it surely is good"
there's also terrible examples in pokemon like say the dark crow mon from early gens
which at first didnt have an evo, therefore low catch rate
but then it got an evo and kept the low catch rate
beldum is arguably not the best example there IMO, but say electabuzz would be - cus the baby mons of gen2 were decently available but the mid stage of them are basically at full evo catch rates, no?
like - not quite but close?
so think clefairy line, magmar line
*just silently shakes his head over the weirdness of catch rates*
"yay Imma bring my 200 dusk balls and my sleep spammer mons!"
cus false swipe against beldum obviously wont work reliably cus of that
aaanyhow: me go shh again, gotta junk the remaining trainers i nofficial "Gym / Dungeon" areas with story flags (so specifically excluding things like mt pyre trainers
and silently screaming at the inherent needed inconsistency in addressing trainers with petalburg gym where you NEED to fight a couple anyway to face norman
which I dont want to figure out which one's which for the speedy routes to take
that doesnt change me not liking that gym's behavior in being a pokemon quiz of sorts
and you being forced to fight a couple even if you want to just rush the leader
so what does memory shroom do - temporary Farores wind style warp set / return point device?
also: whats your opinion on the trick house?
got it, so junk it is in your opinion or dabble with it?
barring Weather institute / space station I think I got the trainers mostly figured out, wanna have a count without those on junked trainers for a laugh?
also I THINK? mt pyre grunt stuff is just blocking you being able to talk to the old couple up there for the item without blind trainers -> me go out on a whim and junk all of the grunts there
is weather institute a single battle off memory v Shelly?
with blind trainers afaik you can manouver around them all
blind trainers is the cure to that if its them facing you
if they literally stand in the way, its not
long story short, I think I'll just junk all the grunt trainers for coherence there, and where they DO pose a battle forcibly by movement, it's then a shrug
cus I know the Admins where there's grunts are part of story flags
and its not necessarily as simple as the 1 grunt in petalburg woods or the cave
imo its a QoL given "gym trainers are junked"
so you can pick your fights if you need experience, otherwise you dont interact with them
if that would be the case, then MAYBE
yea I get that - I just feel like as much as trainer shuffle is a cool addition, I dont want it to be a "oh hey now my checks assault me" if that makes sense PrideLaugh
especially given logic rando = oh yea I can just be in go mode and not care about fights
I definitely see your point in that changed spinner behavior is a decent thing
I havent seen it indepth enough to say something to it so *shrug*
I can see merit in that setting IF its open to the player to adjust the timing
so say: if timing normally is 1s per viewing angle
let me change it to 3s
gain time for a casual to react
rather then it being a "skill gate to timeloss" for a beginner
like - in my opinion any JRPG style game has 2 very non-replay features on stuff like that, and its either a) spinning encounters or b) "forced wardens at doors" if that makes sense
hence why I like blind trainers / purged spinners
cus yea I definitely see it being satisfying to do once you know
but imo its not necessarily the most "everyone" skill to get involved with
and pokemon is that one BIG series on that front which just always has a decent set of "oh we will block your path" fights
for no other reason then keeping you on level
point of annoyance btw: space center specifically PrideLaugh
EVERY other area with multiple floors HAS multiple floors listed
so I cant even try and be smart there junking a couple of them cus I dont know which of them are the forced 3way door blockade
so its like DS1 PTDE rando stuff got it
cus Dark Souls 1 Prepare to Die edition has 3 mods for enemies, fog gates and items respectively
and you need to do them in a specific order for it to work good
and sharing seeds is obviously then triple te hassle
i always forget about the check in the clouds
tldr: its not a good, condensed "1 place to rando" thing
best bans at twitch dot tv phantom5800
and yea no argument can make that not be a hassle
gonna quickly shush for a sec and confirm that I did the things properly
I would want to say "no" to that to an extent?
cus you can do it without the website
just I have never done that
i gen a solo pape seed to see if it works and its sucks
here's the fun bit: once you did patch for emerald, you can just double click it to open it
you dont even have to do all those windows more then once in emeralds case
that being said I cant necessarily hold that against archipelago cus it wasnt necessarily designed with singleplayer seeds in mind
it was moreso meant to ease the multiworld side a lot
I did not know that one actually
What about the universal Pokemon randomizer?
@DJ_Phatzo thats just fun chaos randos
in that sense then yea, ease of use towards singleplayer might be a decent goal
that being said, I do like the multiworld aspect of AP too much personally to give harsh complaints towards singleplayer focus
thats how I test my yaml shenaniganry
no that it does not have
I might have to ask someone on that front
cus I know that that is something which ppl I know have messed with
yaml files that you cant make on a website sucks ass
but I dont know if they did it manually via file editing or via an auto updater within the AP install or whatnot
what I meant with "oh yea you can just do that" is there is the "generate game" option
and like with multiworlds, you can just feed it single yamls instead of collections / zips
i had to change my pape yaml file from the temp and it wasn't fun
here's a super funny thing to AP phantom: yaml files are SUPER weird on the reading side towards gen
if 1 line isnt spaced in right (via backspaces / enters) it wont gen
so you gotta space that manually if you do it fully manual
i just copy paste settings for my pape yaml and its works
its a string interpretation which asks for certain characters during the reading the files type of issue
@blacktiger51 I am talking from the POV of having edited starting items, now junk items, world only items
world only items specifically in the case of DS3
because that game without small lothric banner is SUPER prime to early BK
and then not fun for anyone
@Jonxhas yeah junking items is a no for me in a yaml file
template files to that extent help a bit
which you have on the respective game setup pages
BUT that doesnt fully alleviate the issue
plus you need to know how to read that
which while you'd guess is more common, is truly not
happy the pape yaml is very helpful with the settings
I had played the RC with berries before it was new version
and had accidentally had vanilla HM compat cus of it
which I in that instance was happy to bypass cus I had wonder trades on -> someone else in the multi with emerald sent me the solver to that problem
but it definitely made for a "huh what"
PrideLaugh I would love to say thats a modding specific issue, but normal software updating has too many issues on that end
its a very "not everyone thinks about it" thing
which truly should just be more thought about
but no one ever does until they ran into a problem cus of it
I dropped my TP seed to get food, the very next chest was my go mode phanto274Smile
here's a dumb thought phantom: would you want me to just throw in like 10 rare candies given the amount of gym trainers junked + avoidable?
I am happy I double checked the yaml 🤣
had a typo and 1 miss-copy in there
so it just said "lmao do you mean this?" but threw the entire exclude locations block as error
and who knows if it wont get changes towards QoL / casual experience or nah
cus like - given the amount of things going on with AP => I dont want to say yay / nay to if something happens or not
route 124 I just peeked btw and = its only dive for them there so will just throw them into the junk locales block
then route 127 is just 1 dive item right?
I will not touch the benny hills routes mind btw
which with trainers got a decent chunk more annoyance overall
but given its free fly start (need to check fly locale stuff) its not the worst then at least
and its genning, so I did the things correctly
gonna be a dummy though and give you 2 lucky eggs BECAUSE I did set a random chance for any fight to be a double fight at 40% odds
ahh fair, can bump that then
wanna keep the 4/8 badge req or nah?
it just creates more ice rods
did now also think proper and excluded wonder guard / arena trap / shadow tag from just happening
cus fuck having a lock cus you dont have the moves to deal with a random mon all of a sudden having that
and its not in any other instance yep
same goes to arena trap / shadow tag there
cus it could be fun to just trap a useless mon against your team in front of your bulk setup mon
it however can be a similar case to wonder guard
except now you're locked in against whatever you cant hit
--> me no like, me say nah
I was bantering, I did not double check space station: its Emerald w berries and trainers atop, excluding Gym Trainers (not Leaders!) as well as Grunt hideouts where its not a known fight for prog (so maxie at chimney as an example v his grunts) as well as junking a couple of the normally found annoyance checks (benny hills routes near pacidiflog including trainers NOT TOUCHED!) start inv = 50 max repels, 15 escape ropes, 2 Lucky Eggs and fly(badgeless) are start, no random fly locale atop
settings are checked and can be sent PrideLove
why did he piss his bedsheet!!!!! OH THE HORRORS PERSIST
OMG ur doing a second one.
sent the yaml in randos for review
funny. tonight I did memory shroom - extreme #2
forgot Kooper to a foliage early on. go figure lol
So is the reason why u left Kirby behind was from the powerup carry overs right?
Oh so it was more of the game of the month type thing coolio.
Super Mario Bros. EZ 10 minute speedrun
yeah it's slow if that's all you've been doing your whole life
wasnt the record frame perfect by this point even 🤣
NOTED be a robot to beat it

true, playing it feels very strange when compared to more modern Metroid games
I dont like metroid from the fact u gotta wait til credits to celebrate.
that pillar of light means that the mystery box has appeared on star summit
well apparently my taste in games differs greatly from the masses
are you? I mean you have stuff on your channel that features it
found some more logic stuff on TP tracker tonight
but that's one thing more than the others
lol you just put filler in there haha
before I say anything tho I should prob update my packlist cause it looks right on github
ugh I hate making mistakes in rebasing
someone up and goes changing an entire file underneath me

@RavenFP discord park 2 notes are large

I'll look into them when I get back from this weekend
Yea glenn are you :) you can waggle with me
What's better after a long day of work than killing your arm

I like how they give you a heart container only to be fully restored
I mean the next transition fully restores you
So the HC is useless at that point
It took 4 games to make HAL realize that Link up B is shit

What is that Charizard up air?
I think they should bring that back
What if a subspace damagless run?
@Ohrocks ive done damageless all stages besides maze, practically impossible
tap jump is so bad for this
if mvd practices more strats i could see him doing snake skip in halberd interior cause reasons Chatting
Did you skip the door on purpose?
its faster to enter the door if you dont make the fast cycle anyway

Shoutouts to Freddy Fazbear for winning the splatfest
Sorry Raven, I was playing Unite what was your question?
good, keep doin' what you're doing then
Oh, I would've picked bnuuy if I wasn't so low leveled
Me and Murphey finally got draft in Unite and the game was starting amazing, only for someone on the opposing team to be afk and the match to be cancelled
Me and Murphey finally butted draft in Unite and the game was buttting amazing, obutt for someone on the opposing team to be afk and the match to be buttcelled
We played one more and won but I was so sad
The game prior I had Leafeon unite me 10 times
I probably will try to grind Splatoon to get better
Also I have a problem with you
Why tf is there no Toad?
But toad is chill and normal
It goes on sale for 10$ a lot of the time
I'll just get it for you since I haven't given you a real birthday gift
Ōkami on switch is also a good way to play cause motion controls and a semi port of the Wii version
I wish I was cool enough to actually come up with that name
You do know what I'm referring to right?
Oh no!  Our table... It's broken
If you want chill, play SPM JP virtual console so every room you load in has a slight chance of crashing
Snake Puppet Ganon has good ass song

Also did you hear that Ho-Oh was leaked for Unite?
The Unite uses energy to revive your whole team
So they're probably support or defender
I butt do flarakarry and the game blaziken would be really sick, there butt like me, but I don't understand how to remap my raphnet for my Butt Madbutt bracbutt.
Oh damn it be like that
Are you muted or are youn just not sayin shit lolol
Windows is ass what else is new
He sounded so sad wtf lolol
I just saw that one of the stream tags is "IdkWhoLooksAtTheseButHi"
Also if you arent doing anything later, wanna play some strive to help me for cb?
I am liking the red tunic
you said that "I'm gonna cause problems" in a VERY similar way to the "I'm gonna [OMITTED]" discord clip, so I had to do a double take
yes / no, I'm in the area but I haven't actually gone home
I'm in no rush to go home
stopped to clean my friend's cat litter boxes, she has a bad back and we're VERY close by to each other, so I've no reason not to help her out
ooh, how much the silver rupee cost?

Shield's important cuz you eventually need Mirror, right?
didn't think that was a solution
can you take the spear with you?
solely cuz the WORORO when they expire

heard a chime or two from Snowfall in that cutscene music, stg
Do you have time bomb throws or can they explode upon impact?
having to do a LOT of fights with being able to fight sums it up
I think regular bombs SUCK! stickshamSUCKS
someone bookmarked my tweet that was just a picture of chucky

"I usually don’t like glitch logic seeds but"
can it really be pain with this cute ds era link model
i think next time i do a rando i'll use this one, i didn't realize how good this one was
the squall one is really funny
i almost picked the cloud one on my last seed but i knew squall would be funnier
"be my apprentice" gives you a pear
Sometimes I forget that's an emote
I can't do any kind of glitch logic in AP spitle1Mad
ok nvm, I'm not doing AP pape at all
they still have it locked to progressive scaling
and now, I begrudgingly head "home"
for reference, I dropped 74 off around 3:15
I woke up to being in Pope chat the other day and holy SHIT, what a stream to wake up to
I commented "where did I wind up" and chat started sniffing me

You could buy Ōkami with 20$
That's just the vanilla price of dog game
Cool idea, if it only didn't leave you dizzy
My pc blue  screened i didnt go offline LMAO
Can't believe is a semi silent protagonist
Oshawott just vibes in the water
I get that feeling, one arm being superior in some aspects and the other being good at others
Which way do you need to shake?
I was probably gonna suggest sideways up and down
Go on Twitter and look at art of dogs
I'm still eepy and Jesse almost got me to get back on Unite after trying to tell me to go to bed
They're going be behind an a event to obtain for free... Untill everyone just outright buys them
did u see my message in sub chat?
can u like release my items later? KEKW
Oh snap. Brawl speedrun?  that’s cool!
wait why were we making all of those cakes just to destroy one
or runs, however it turns out
hope the trip was a good one?
how’s it going guys? I can’t stay too long but hope you guys doing well
sounds like a reasonable thing - quick'n curious sees everything rather early and all
As for me I saw a 10 minute long metal performance of one winged angel
Much love bois y’all awesome see ya next time. y’all smooven rn
why do you have to beat them to be their apprentice
nooooooooo the run is dead bc you skipped a split
why do the bad guys tell you exactly how to foil their scheme
Man now I kinda wanna do an Any% of this, i've only done e100%
do you have to like do the motion that it shows?
these fights loves to spawn bumpers
aww man that back-air would've ruined Yoshi
I totally forgot brawl had like a story mode
I think Lucas has the best arc
grounded up b with pit is your best way to get up stuff vertically

marcoGL phanto274GL orcris1GL richarGL beestGLGLGL avarie1GL marcoGL_HF
Tip for the fight: use iron tail a lot
Alright, wasn't sure if Zack added those kinda tips
I should probably do that for All Friends
You can lose time here if you mess up at the end fyi
Rest of the attraction doesn't matter all that much how you do
I'm doing a pape mw and i have the setting on where you cant do oob Madge
Yeah that minigame is really weird
It is more constistent to shake 1 beat early on the poses for whatever reason
no i change it to false it was on true
i also did a smw seed it was cool but not being able to run was lame
I'm in 1 with 36 seed i have 3 seeds KEKW
it definitely is one of those "in solo, the movement being locked away is just annoying" cus you dont have any memes to go with
100% not a solo thing KEKW
i am so Madge tho i could beat ch5 but no
If you see any itemboxes in this area and you're planning on getting an extra friend, pick them up
If you get a melodybox before you enter the unawarehouse you can get a really fast extra friend
Yeah you'd think there would be some quest involving the other areas
@ravenfp hope you are doing I am loving your streaming
My advice is to not charge the projectile when doing the one in the tower
are you interested in some sort of arts and designing for your channel? if yes , then you can connect with me on mt discord
this the setting in the yaml prevent_ooblzs and its set to true i put false cuz how it was worded
i will know for next time i guess
CLose call would be a perfect title for that clip
Oh yeah for the upcoming lab section, remember that Tepig carries items faster than all the other pals
What other games have you ran before? Other than wind waker
Well unfortunately you're not gonna be doing much cool stuff like that in a park run :/
Well unfortunately you're not gonna be butting much cool stuff like that in a butt butt :/
Oh yeah you can lose time here too, so make sure you get all the rings
lol this run isn't exactly arm friendly
Oh yeah double jumping here won't work if you're doing the tower hop
you have to jump then shake, then double jump, then shake again
Sorry if i'm backseating too much, you seem like you came pretty well prepared all things considered
Since it is my duty to ask this, have you considered an All Friends run?
It is much more fun to do as a race definitely
You already know what this is for
Also you get to do cool pikaclips
In any% they are basically just for style
There's one that you can save time on if you're cracked but we're talking barely a second
It is basically just switching to either tepig or pika while standing on certain edges
It is pretty tight but you can get good enough to do it on 1st or 2nd try consistently
I kinda like the really long ones, cause i feel like i can plan out my day better
Either it has to be super short or long enough that it feels like the runs mean something
Yeah that one is feels satisfying still
I kinda like that the cutscenes are so long in this game
Cause you can have some pizza & coke like Badabun without being a complete troll
Well, there are some mashers though to be sure..
Yeah when you hit the bell
2:49 is pretty good for a first run
I had a 2:49 tho which is solid for a first real run
It's 6 minutes faster than glenn and that's what matters
Cheer100 spongebob: hu hu hu yee haw hu hu who uh! hu hu hu woah! hu? hu hu! eh! eh! hua hua hua! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu! hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu!

He doesnt care about the kkona's pain
you have like 15 minutes of timesave if you remember what all the fights are :3
I don't care what anyone says, I love it over the rest.
Just screw Tabuu with his unavoidable OHKO.
His Wing Pulse instakills one character.
You said you wanted a bumper. Kappa
had a friend smash a controller due to counters
just died to ICC trash because i was typing
Le gasp, 32 months and Jesse is still throwing on a daily basis?  Hope you're having a good time Phantom!
What if you grab slided into the blastzone?
Idk, but if they did hopefully they don't think that grenade is a pro Strat
i perfer to main Spider over Snake
When will game devs understand that AS is not great game design
Ngl, I got lost in dragon's dogma 2 for a while
Absolutely was, Decent game with a good replayability factor.
ima go eat good luck on rest of run!
why dont you spawn in the bottom left
Oh darn missed a victory runback
SO how was ur time there?

don't you just love ap mw 🙃
even snes emu is ass to connect
Seashell is building up for Phantom checks, and gold leaf is also another progressive item for checks
Pretty good when, just have to turn my volume high but it's all balanced out
Sorry I had a stroke typing there
when i updated everything i have a new oot connecter so that why i couldn't use my old bizhawk i guess
hope the seed's been good so far?
searching for a poptracker pack for ladx
found one for the switch version
how big are the differences between ladx to remake?
well that thought out the window then
How's that kid not break his legs?
figure out how the tie in works
you absolutely can shuffle the trade items
I renember distinctly sending people gold leaves and rooster and shit before
or at least I think it was
yes trade quest stuff is shuffleable
just might not be in your seed then
oh nvm there's no yosher doll in the center here
and bottom right the AP icon with its respective options dont help?
Having the smallest one be last is so shit
sent a screen on your discord in rando as for what I mean
it opens up a pop up menu with room and all
so server, slot name, password and connect - would have to roll a seed to test rn
At least you have a wind waker
so its not dynamic scaling well is what I hear
slot name would be your player name from the room for ladx
Stop starting at me with em' big ol' eyes
cus I mean - string interpreting be like
sounds honestly fair to just go manual tracking rly
honestly quite surprised this tracker hasnt been taken by ANY crafty soul to just add on over to some of the other existing maptrackers existing
yea what I mean - that there hasnt been any person who just did it for shits
cus like - tracker options are always a not bad to have
and the AMOUNT of work they put into the OoTR pack for emotracker?
yea guess what - that very pack has been used in parts for reference towards frickin MMOoTR
I wouldn't care, honestly if it's a hassle to use, someone should make a better version to use so it's easier for the community.
and while I personally wouldnt need it, power to'em
or hell - another good one is gossips tracker
which is basically a notepad with extra features right
had an HD version, OG dev wanted to do all sorts of things - and the DK64 rando community forked off of it made their own version, and now yet someone else again went and updated it even more
Like I know time goes into these things but if they won't go out of their way to make it better are you really betraying them?
if the only reason is "respecting the work" - then you can ALSO respect it and love it by forking off of it and porting it to other programs
do you know if there a video somewhere for pape where u hit the block going to ch7 with superboots
cus the MAP ITSELF was part of the work too
like - the very logic you described to my brain doesnt make sense much
PLUS having a basically "online only" tracker is ALWAYS a shitty idea in my head
I think it would be funny but also like... why would they ban?
I think it would be funny but also like... why would they butt?
cus I BET the logic between the AP and standalone respectively are basically on parity?
feature parity maybe not, but logic side
if I were told for a casual rando experience, that I am forced online for the tracker to func
I'd just not play the rando
like.... I love my manual tracking OPTION as much as its cool to have options towards autotracking / online towards AP
but FUCK a trtacker being stuck there imo
sorry ik I am ranting and wall of texting about it
and like - even frickin windwaker with its wooferz has found its way to emotracker last I renember
and while the respective maptrackers on servers (so WWR / your Maptracker respectively)are cool
its always a overall smoother experience if there's an offline option for it too
data limits exist, shitty web exists
and while yes one can try to go and say "oh yea those lil kilobytes of data shouldnt exceed any data plans" - we ALL have had experiences where minor things JUST like that caused it and we were like "FUCK"
people will love when they're ready
easily navigateable, easy to open / close, interact with yep!
the ONLY reason why I saw it
was bc I had to fullscreen the tracker on a 1080p windo
for it to even show up properly
yea I figured you went up there PrideLaugh
but given I didnt even see the entire map my brain was like "uhhh shit"
so I full screen windowed it and then saw those icons and was like "HUH"
I will never get over how cursed Toon link sized toad will be
AND it gets flagged by windows defender 🤣
yea NO SHIT can you tell ppl to just forgo basic, existing anti virus for this shit
like - we're not all linux bred
again: and I know I have been ranting, I get that any piece of logic writing towards a tracker is WORK and during free time and all that
just let other people who want to do it do it then
this sounds like a toxic relationship
holy creepers in a thunder storm
marin is havin ia frickin party on the screen rn
I'm assuming they found power bracelets
oh guess what - another thing which while I get that love from some ppl - magpie based on python
my brain immediately shuts off cus as much as I can understand not wanting to organize variables and shit
I'd rather do that 20 times over including strict definition of data types over some random code based fuck up
surely someone has to have made a quagsire skin for ww rando
just because a single piece of code decided to go sideways in its self-interpretation
yea it feels like its bowow related
You need to lose 20 rupees rn
so... points where IMO magpie loses me = online only pack (could be a 1off lets still use it cus I mean I mentioned wooferz for WWR)
did you see that pape ap can now have shuffle chapter difficulty?
as well as it not scaling at all size wise
prog chapter difficulty is a "yea this is a 1off rather everytime setting"
its bc it takes literally ANY key item
so by the point where you reach the yoshi island, you immediately jump 2 chapters
and the ap i am doing i am level 13 and only clear 2 chapters
and fighting doesnt have much logic to go with that => haha lul have fun eating life shrooms every couple boss fights
like - the only fight logic you need is for bosses, cus all theother encounters are avoidable
cuz for some reason double xp is on
i have 5 hp and last stand gonna be pissed if i have to level up hp
anyhoo to the ladx tracker: happy that I at least was able to find something to it even if it didnt end up helping in regards to actually using it much
marin will have a field day now
someone asking for a video for chapter 7 bridge with super boots. You kinda just do it lol No video needed KEKW
looks like oracle of seasons and ages have a ap mw
Oh the FCC voted to restore net neutrality today
@blacktiger51 that must be alpha stages
There's differences between 1.0 JP and English
@Jonxhas yeah most likely cool tho
Vanilla 1.0 JP has no Sephiroth or other super bosses outside of the phantom boss, English adds the other remaining super bosses and Sephiroth
cus ppl have been asking for that very interaction
oh yea jabu in 2d is a brainfuck
goin through it turns into "huh where what?"
like - I can see knowing the dungeon helping it a lot
but it feels like one of those "whoops I am just linear" dungeons
and dipping dungeons in a 2d zelda always kinda stinks
if ONLY I'd have the actual bag to go with it
like - the reason I dont mind it in link to the past mostly is because "oh yea its a quick dungeon dip in most cases"
gl lets go ratio'd my ass halqerLove
no you have 2 and a half hearts Kappa
anyhoo I think Imma be a bit more lurky now, got they are billions open and wanna see if I can manage the higher difficulty of it well
Does it not have to be the special e
gotta say btw that I love the FCC thing mentioned earlier
cus it might be one of those things then making its way to europe too
with their search engine side, youtube
what I find being big about it is also enabling the next step of it being a right to have access to the net for news as an example similar to say radio or newspapers
which that has been something ppl have been advocating for over here (think globally it was talked about, grain of salt - only have heard about it from within germany in regards to it)
plz tell me there is a die%
where it being a right for those very means alone would be an enabler to get towards more widespread access to the net as is
marin is not rly happy about the cave map 🤣
anyhoo - I blabbered on and on - imma lurk now and play they are billions tippiTap
fingers crossed its a good seed overall!
I saw an arcade version of the mobile port lol
It was like gazing at an alternate universe where fighting games were truly dead
the one towards the mailbox raven? yea that works
its just off the small rock into a roll jump

He does fall in love with Vanilla in the anime
Although, a lot of people would get it with Vanilla
Although, a lot of people would butt it with Vanilbutt
I saw someone I follow who doesn't post about Sonic go berserk over goth Vanilla art on the timeline
People also want to get it with Rouge
I think that jump sucks stickshamSUCKS
what even did you do to achieve this raven 🤣
Do you think you could have a capture of the text client in the blank spot in the top left so we can more easily see what's being sent?
I have one stream open but both chats open
ok goin for some mental biking gl with rest
how did this even happen raven
and dont say "oh its storage"
cus I swear 90% of the times where shit breaks in windwaker its storage
I was mowed my grandma's giant lawn today
so those are random hints here then?
thats what they've been cookin there
2d zeldas always have some glorious jank
*continues to hop around for forever*
dont encourage squeenix, there hasnt yet been a slime based keyblade and I am HAPPY about it
but what did the wandering chicke nugget do to ya KEKW
meanwhile if raven wants to provoke the same effect for WW, he gotta do it to the big sniffer digger
cant you enter earth temple raven?
even if its a junk locale, you can use it for hints
what about the northern quadrants with their watchtowers raven?
distinctly renember there being 1 which as you need bow for 1 check
you can trick the cannons into opening this, then you'd need storage to go through the place for anything rly
lol my group is finally doing thier first race
inb4 the toad model disallows the roll clip you're tryin to do 🤣
my money is on some random watchtower chest
doesnt bow deal with the cannons also?
or am I derping there given how broken rang is
raven: you could just do the auctions for hints
as in doin the "yea ik this is a nothing item" checks
they still woulc ount as checks ya did
or is sunari already bought out there
do you have the watchtowers shuffled even then?
cus afaik they are part of the base kit shuffle
there's a free one at the golf quadrant?
and north of dragon roost afaik is the triple watchtower where you got bow for to fight wizzrobes
Best Viewers on StreamBoo .com  ( cutt.ly/yw6DDyMb )
maybe ya needed your bombs or your hammer raven?
maybe a logic bug since wind waker is in beta
both respectively open up that, no?
because i just joined stream and i can never let a minor grammar mistake go unpunished
why would he not be toad?
why would he not be butt?
>stream called multiworld >join stream >one world, zelda world > mfw runera3Mad
Not a healthy multiworld for sure
my hole is on the bottom if anyone's asking
I was foretold of your name by the one known as dadmoley
trying to get rearbot to correct one of 'em to butt
mf'er's running around in a diaper and barefoot

oh sorry you needed that? I ate it

I'm convinced my cat thinks he's a dog
is there a pegasis jump maybe thats easier?

ahh so yah than thats just extreme lol
bye all thx for teamwork epicness
there has to be a winner and loser
*work lurk while it’s not busy*
i am Madge i am gonna have to fight final with 20 hp most likely
i was thinking about doing a tp rando soon
feli, you need to see this one
I stop marking the map completely
yeah, I broke away after 20 hours
phantomm im here to annoyyy uuuu
also uwu to the octo on bed
oh the only thing I changed is exclude hidden village cats
I dunno how often it ticks
im on 6k and i  have hospital in way soo  bleh
220 points a hour for non sub
but yea, subs get an increase
watch streaks give a decent chunk too
aka tuning in when ya get the chance
(which to be fair, imo watch streaks are fomo inducing but thats me)
there no watch steaks here Sadge
btw you can call epona then talk to Fado and itll start
come to think, not meant as a press, pure curiosity: did you get the chance to look over the settings I had sent ya for emerald or busy days like overall?
as in "given the premise" potential adjustments
most streams ar 5 hour for most peoples sooo  thats 45 streams
just my brain wantin to make sure the premise of the settings is solid
just saw the dungeon layout you gotta do - thats an interesting combo
just sad that basically all of them could lock shit behind lantern
it gonna be a sword hunt seed
I was really surprised I got a 3:27 the other day
that sounds like ya routed accidentally onto the god route yea
though who am I to say that given I have only like 4 seeds of this total done
so like - to me it sounds like that :D
"oh no my web, I need a bath NOW!"
Jonxhas, the seed I last locationed my sphere zero progession. I just got luck at the end.
and also like - given this rando doesnt have "WotH" hints similar to Windwaker in that sense, just sounds like what would end up happening
My seccond dungeon was mines, talo sharpshooting gave go mode double clawshot letting me skip every check in city in the sky
and still like a rock solid time imo
and then bkeysy being what it is, you just needed to set the wind if even = done
know what I wish one could work somewhat against? the HUUUGE sphere 0 in lake hylia
like - this region specifically is sooooo dense its honestly somewhat annoying to my brain
that red rupee here is a rando red or is that always here?
cus I swear I dont renember it existing in vanilla
anti "get stuck at lower lake hylia" 20 bucks
my guess is honestly it being anti get stuck given how would you get away from here without shadow crystal / money
and completely itemless you cant really fight anything either
he to me is called raffler rather then auru brain wise
I played this game tooo often in german loclaization
would it? why is that KEKW
isnt pal normally the slow one?
this minigame is free just a bit of an autoscroller
I'd do this over boat shooting downstream anytime
(says the person never junkin that either)
esp given now that'd include without mods in gmod
if yall didnt hear about it: its still not quite certain if troll or not but gmod and other sandbox games from ages ago have had stupid shit happening on the dmca front towards specifically nintendo mods
you know glitchless is a real category right
wouldnt glitchless fail the moment analog glitch happens
but the fact its a 20yr old gamehas had stuff in it for forevern
and its mostly sandbox silly bogus with ppl having done all sorts of TTT and shit over the years for like 10+ years
honestly the ONLY point I could see right
which... yeaaaa thats a very VERY fucked order of prio if it were that
love btw that he's only 500 in rando
as much as I dont get why the town market is still 2k without doing the bridge goron
I love you can give him 100 at once
would be painful if it'd be the 50 increments with 1k price of vanilla
"here's a silly question mayhaps" - nvm the question is gone, the bow and arrow distracted and made it disappear KEKW
WHY did the game have to freak out like that KEKW
Imma guess thats one of the tricks I might need to learn just for routing convenience truthfully
I dont know about any of the jumps, I ONLY know chimken way
any news on whether ooccoo's now behave better?
or are they still weirdly dungeon bound yet not?
must be ppl just most of the time not needing to use ooccoo anyway
as much as I hate box movement, worth a try at least ye
and obviously "if you have rang, you just LJA"
like with most long distance gaps
by jus throwing it up high
and then timing LJA on return of rang
the targeting is only really necessary if you want more precision no?
though imma guess the outer rim of kak vill up there might have extra collision
cus I mean clearly the wall exists
that could be harder given the low distance it travels without targeting
can you go over your next trick here?
i tried it but had to give up
oh yea curious on the wolf method here
the one time I tried it and couldnt get it, it had bow LUL
whats the chest at kak called near watchtower?
on the tracker its just north of all the kakariko town checks
just was curious cus search terms for yt
I did find a couple LJAs and also the wolf link jump for it
so either no one messed with it or its not doable is my current guess
aka me go mess with it at some point
but bets its just a case of "not many people have messed with tricks for newcomers yet"
cus I mean - thereÄs LOTS of tricks ppl have available which just arent researchable
stratdb might be a good place for tpr tech
yeah no one uploads anything there lol
well good that for mm I know where to look on yt at least
pushy has everything youd ever need
and if not pushy, ya take gigopler
just gonn be sad if the other rod is in here and delete forest tempe ooccoo PrideLaugh
its a crime they never brought back the item wheel after this
its a crime they never made a good Zelda game in 18 years
hey phatom :) gl on runs
oh wait? skyward sword had item wheel too?
item wheel in ss is different though
when he throws a ball and chain at you? KEKW
swapping for golden wolf would be cool
play the game as shade lol
it is in ww and its the same engine
just depends on how rough that whole thing is
as in "how rough is TP with this over WW"
yeaa well thats the beanbag of "ehh" in my opinion
like... cartoon art style you can easier just "make something work" with artistically
bomb arrows on this fight is so busted
on the other hand its unfair imo how monke doesnt react to YOUR boomerang when he clearly should
i never thought of shooting the eye like that
oh 2nd phase is free like that yea
it does that for me too
1st phase you can also do it, but sometimes ya get dunked on for nonsense
where does wolf link hold his ruppees?
or midna carries them on her face
like the shield during the first twili section of vanilla
I was thinking the spider softlocked you phanto274Smile
oh armogohma can be a BITCH
and as much as you mentioned it not being related to you aiming at armogohma, my brain somehow not ONCE had good rng on aiming v always good when not aiming at it 🤣
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
i know why i couldn't aim on bizhawk now
you have to actually bind the sticks KEKW
cus there's both axis binding and "up down left right" binding which you unbind for sticks to work
yeah you see on pj64 you don't so i didn't know KEKW
PJ has input plugins for that sorta stuff
and some of them are super jank like
gonna let dog out, be back in a bit
why does tp rando always feel like its the worst one possible
thanks ads for playing st the exact moment i pose a question
the map of TP is a similar case to how OoT flows rly imo
where its just "a couple areas are more deadzones for traversal"
and if you dont get good traversal, you just run through them multiple times for nonsense reasons
or for what feels like nonsense reasons*
its just a bigger world really
the prime example you could throw at that if not starting with fast travel options is windwaker
because you literally just sail in circles
and then you need all the sword upgrades, grapple, all bows, hookshot j ust for the boss
not to mention whatever leads to it
to me windwaker is fine as it is, but definitely more of a "trickle" then "burst" style rando
what I personally dont vibe with with WWR is how basic rulesets allow for all the tricks and such
because its definitely not "yea ez"
but then again I can just ignore that truthfully as logic isnt built around that luckily
I guess the HC wolf could also be a bit of an issue if it wasnt already junk there
given its locked behind village access
just my brain being like "if one were to junk that direction, one would have to also junk that by extension cus game dumb"
similar to the doctor chest (though that one is more excusable I reckon given its partway through the wood statue collection)
I tried telling this to someone and they told me I was dumb
when I literally had found this out during casual and they then ran face first into a boko here
it do be tempting yea and I think there's a rare chance for the leevers just to never be an issue?
I mean I wouldnt do that KEKW
but my guess goes you can have leevers stay in a constant pattern by RNG where none of them do the small circles, meaning you can just ignore them basically
what also most of the time doesnt happen sadly
just hide and seek, I didnt realize there were other checks there
what else is there in that chain?
sky book check (needs 1 rod and village access)
aka you deal with the enemies, then show her the rod to get the book
the village was always so fun for me
it is fun to do once or twice
in rando if you want less backtracky stuff, the village is a prime time junk area with its associated checks sadly
as you need to enter it like minimum 2 to 3 times separately during the quest just for the checks to work
Rain is mocking you Phan lol
is that a sphere zero rod? KEKW
all the statues are dumb afaik with the sky character checks btw
isnt there a greg on the platforms of fyer and whatshecalled
cus 1 is treasure chamber HC in terms of origin
could be either that or some lantern cave chest
they didn't deserve that overkill lolz
just know that I am always here. watching
i don't even know who they are KEKW
Don't worry. The 3rd VIP is just around the corner
this owl statue is hilarious imo
you want me to tell you why it doesnt anymore to me? KEKW
you can do the first 2 jumps as wolflink with JA jumps
and then you only need the owl statue in the last lil niche
you just go straight to the first 2
then line owl up to this one
want me to name the owls?
Eldin Bridge, Hylia Bridge, Hylia Amphitheatre, Desert, Kak Gorge Corner, Faron Woods jumps
and the one in the past which you most likely already did
is this a "out of checks" / "forgot a check" moment? HahaSweat
haaate that feeling of running dry on things to do in a rando
have you checked the chest in kakariko?
OwO zelda moment, when link barks at the game to get his things PrideLaugh
the bug here would be on the bridge
just past the arch, lefthand side
well the bridge has 2 arches
and the 2nd clawshot on that note
or can you pass chandeliers towards the darknut in HC without?
that explains why I dont know about it
I saw that in your latest youtube rando vod
the youtube extention I have lets me watch videos at x10 speed. Thats 1 minute of TP rando in 6 seconds LUL
my dude...just do it the old fashioned way
yea its a bit of a rough one to line up
go to where the seal is and then move the statue
under the vines...then walk it over to the middle
green spot on the dirt near the wall I'd say
i drop on it, go to sky character and move it again
like - right in front of link there, in the grey is a green spot
where you landed by jumpin down earlier
didnt know you could just do that
I always get character, position owl on that green speck in the dirt near wall I mentioned, then back up and then over
im still trying to find a line up
i usually just position it under the vines and then walk it over
too many solutions to that single owl
and not really clear visibility from atop / sides
must be clawshot + rang shenanigans
oohhhh you still need the poes in here...
excuse me i would like you to go fast
it more then likely does work
why would the collision be changed about
marcoGL richarGL phanto274GL avarie1GL beestGLGLGL marcoGL_HF
Holy smokes TP being hard core on the menu today.
didnt know that was a thing
what my brain I think doesnt get is how that would affect the gate checking for what is / isnt defeated
but that gotta explain itself soon I guess
if only i was this good
like - the reason I would guess this doesnt open the door is cus rando needs to make sure you can always fight all the poes
does it not check all 4? KEKW
so nintendo tried to be smart
but cus of tricks existing, that doesnt help them
I want to type something to what you typed stavros but it would definitely be a questionable one KEKW
@stavros12c34anenoglou Volvagia was so difficult for me dude
No we werent quiet enuff chat
you just quick spin stallord once you get the chance to attack rly
on ordon sword its annoying, master sword is mostly fine
i dont think 1 cycle is possible with ordon sword
and on the wooden sword... well..... you most likely wont get it
just thinkin you COULD cus stallord is on the ground for a while if you dont go normal b finishers
can I teel you where it was?
this doesnt even look too rough to do
cus that was the one I had worries about KEKW
also maaan this game rly is having a field day with the audio today
it was slightly muffled BGM on the darknuts fight mostly
whats the intended way to find how to light those torches?
isnt it also marked by ghosts?
good thing you have the milk
that also did not look too obad
coming from someone who likes MMR where pixelshots in SHT exist
where the only reason why a specific case of it isnt a problem is because you can set yourself up decently well via line up on wall into backflipping away from it
so truthfully - I think I can replicate this
I just need to have a freezeframe of your clawshot out pos while you are in Target cam
I got a 3:36 on this
and then I bet I can nudge it
iron boots are in spring double clawshot chest phanto274Smile
how do you do quick final phase?
run behind, JA -> quick spin last I renember axl
just that dorf sometimes is a bit annoying on it
how the frick was that done in 3 combos KEKW
I figured it would PB, it was only sphere 3
my 3:27 was spherre 8 LUL
cus I know you can do that for quicker damage output
ive done it a few time but im not consistent
so its basically a combined damage recog game-side which somehow multiplies damage
would be funny af if you get there and it's just an item
that the rough explanation of it?
cus I did try this, the stagger combo of it definitely went through
but I had WAY more JA/spin combos then just 3 KEKW
i should def check out youtube version at some point
yo thats like almost never all of them! PrideLaugh
look at your bot meming itself
you know...i always wondered how long did this whole thing take because that woman had her baby lolz
how to you make a copy text iin discord? Like you click it and it auto copies?
the fact that the pregnancy went well with all the shit which went on in hyrule during that is more surprising
I still dont get why midna did this
so that something like this doesn't happen again
now zant is trapped in the light world though
and he was the true problem paired with ganon
she basically just closed the door so the twili realm never has to deal with it
ganon had powers even without the triforce though
you see all the fountains again afaik
it being split credits also is a bit of a hard sell imo
so now zant just roams hyrule like a peasant lolz
if only hyrule warriors wouldnt be such a paintrain to get everything if you had a wii u
otherwise I mighta tried to get that
i chose to not play hyrule warriors
see you in the next game when you again get pulled
I found it! You do 3 (`) before and after it
now spirit tracks....will you ever play that?
I didnt know what "copy blocks" woulda been either 😅
love the scoff after the no xD
who in the hell even fixed the statues
I like spirit tracks more personally
mostly cus it is more refined compared IMO
spirit tracks saved me one lonely christmas so its very special
okay I hated the flute too LUL
I preferred both over the ship and fishing
I did like controlling the train with the touch screen
i gotta play it at some point
I can see what you mean for sure
also I am tainted by wanting to hundo both
and phantom hourglass is godawful to hundo
spirit tracks at least lets you "just do it" PrideLaugh
to be fair the intro sequence of spirit tracks is annoying yea
sad cus the 3rd dungeon is where those become more interesting imo
sounds like me when it came to sonic and the secret rings
except walking upside down room phanto274Smile
I prefer Snowpeak over arbiters personally
will you again not do the one thing though
or will you pick it up today
you can tell if its a trap?
snowpeak pisses me off but like...blizzeta is fun
so like it could be a boomerang, the reload and its boots?
IF the rando is able to do it
cus OoTR as an example doesnt change models for traps
but 50 is a nice flat number
cus in OoT kokiri shields are only 50 in scrubs, and rarely
most of them are 40 or less
40 then 80 if you were to buy the hylian
awsm pink link this go around
the whole thing where I mistyped "on" with "in" cus scrubs sales in OoT?
so many random corrections out of nowhere lolz
is it worth doing other checks or just rush forest?
ohh - that was just my brain typin out the answer smashing enter 😅 and then realising I should explain myself
removing bugs will be so nice
yea.. I dunno if bugs are the true pain there - turning them in would be annoying if you didnt junk agitha
so its rly a nothingburger type change
how did this even happen KEKW
cake by the ocean more like death in the lake
that sounds like 5 quotes in one and none of them was made to make sense
why cant you go left side?
yea that would be an issue
wait but you broke it with the bomb?
in the lobby its harder to line that up I reckon
I love using clawshot to reach boss room here
the orchestral swell when he pulls out the bomb bug gets me every time
Yoo Phantom, how are you? phanto274Smile
high corner of the bigger pillar
it has a lil poly corner stickin out from that spot left edge of it
100% fair just wanted to mention it tippiALove
not like it could be much of worth logically anyway unless clawshot were to be super early
its definitely the type of check which only makes sense to go OoL for if you know you already have it looming through CitS as example
oh cool, I found an emotrakcer for mario party. Lets you track the happening, coin, and mini game stars
yeah, those are the only bonus stars in MP4 which I did buy a copy of recently lol
but this game isnt LTTPR where shit deals like what, 6 hearts upwards in 1 boop
I forgot that that is how you can peek this ._.
my verry first seed it had master sword
I cant imagine Splatoon 1 going for much these days now that online is gone.
like you cant even buy gear from the shops
i wonder if there are speedruns with the amiibo?
all it does is give you a different weapon for all the story missions. Like you can use sniper only for example
can you get that check without the boat?
so like you cant swim out and clawshot it?
like thats how you do the morpheel fight LUL
I always forget it’s now also
have you done any TP tracker updates recently? I havent updated in the last week and a half
and do you plan of adding twilight maps?
did you guys find out if the bomb trick will work in the lobby?
ooooo the uh...fishing spot where you get the jar? will you get something else instead?
got tired of being sent to ad city
^She just told me that lol
dude link wanted his time to shine xD
i dont think that boar like you
not sure how you can do this so easily....played this game so many times and have failed countless times
twitch ads are making me hungry
i ate dinner a couple hours ago
but got hit with a pizza ads KEKW
want mcds buut too late for doordash
its never too late for that
did they get rid of the one in the poe room?
one on left and one on right...you only got the right one
i missed a bunch anyway lolz
i actually love this boss fight
i knew it was too late...fucked up the order...
do you have boss keys enabled
Always good to see you live
Never even thought to use explosives here... wow
i dont think they make ess adapters for tp
well it just makes wii vc games has the same ess value as they do on a real n64
it would just be cheating for this game Kappa
holy shit you might do this again
is that the game komari runs?
i have no idea what that is KEKW
i thought it was just me lol
i thought it was just me lol
damn i was afk and missed 1st NOOOO
why does a racing game have such a banger track
it really did though, I had to rush to YouTube for a minute to hear it one more time

only 9000 more hours to master it Kappa
i did like 10 boosterLurk but i know this game very well
I know this game well too
I have like 4000 in TTYD tho
Anyone else excited for TTYD remake?
Anyone else excited for TTYD remake?
I really was excited until I just saw that it'll be limited to 30 fps
instead of the up to 60 the OG was capable of
meh i don't really care about ttyd remake
I'm a bit disappointed that it seems to be easier. But that just means my fiancée will enjoy it.
Can't wait to play this 20-year old game for the first time in half the original framerate phanto274ColonD
more hype for a real ttyd rando
Hunter might do something with the remake. He made TOK Refolded after all.
Hunter Xuman, ZXMany, and some other switch modders might have a mod ready by the end of the year
I liked the Google Translated version
I liked the Google Translated version
But it's not finished and the modder stopped working on it
It was called Book of Mario: King of Miami
It was called Book of Mario: King of Miami
but not on the way back LETSGO
It looks like chapter 5 scaling
the numbers marked next to the stars on the tracker are what phantom marked the scaling as
When I played rando the tracker didn't have that
Nice feature that's in the tracker. And the fact that Phantom made it himself too. :)
Yeah I last played like 9 or 10 months ago
glgl with rando! :)) hope ur well
I forgot who it was but someone beat Anti Guy without damaging him while he was asleep. He thought Anti Guy would wake up like in some other RPG or something. But even without attacking him in his sleep, the LPer still won the battle.
only for it to be a dried shroom or something garbage YEP
I guess in most RPGs, enemies wake up when damaged. It's a 50% chance in TTYD if I'm not mistaken.
So just to be clear, the Bizhawk tracker has the same updates as the other one?
I don't need an external tracker or anything?

Again, I last played almost a year ago
I didn't see it in the notes
I did hammerless and bootless but not itemless, unless you just mean starting without items.

Oh cmon I wanna see Pikachu tackling the shit out of chikorita
i dont remember speedrunning ever in my life
I HAVE SPENT THE PAST 2 WEEKS LOSING SLEEP OVER MY LICENSING PROGRAM
So you speedrun and play soccer?
if i get my next license in coaching the red bulls gives me 5 extra dollars :)
I only know of that team because of European football and our goat rafa Marquez KEKW
i use to speedrun and coach soccer
i come out of hiding every couple of months
but i got phantom into speedrunning pokepark and mario
now phantom is big time and i am a simple chatter
It's crazy how red bull has the franchise all over the place being real
Lava Piranha is easy for me
red bulls buys clubs to use :)
I don't even remember what Leipzig was before buying tbh
yeah easy for me too but he always have 0 hp Kappa

I DIDNT BEAT YOU YET IN PARK NOOOO
@SwiftPichu_ nope it was called the NY Metrostars it was bought in 06
damn this seed is amazing but also so bad
Oh didn't know the cosmos is up in the air still ghunzoNOTED
@SwiftPichu_ yeah they arent fielding teams in their league so the owner can use that to help in his lawsuit glennj5BONK  which sucks cause they are my local team since i was young
phantom get distracted rn by this message
I did FP Only in TTYD. I beat the Shadow Queen but I still have to do the Pit. I already died 3 times.
twice in the 90s and once at Bonetail
@glennjaamin feel you on that, the team I supported as a kid like way too little got stuck in the 2nd division and can't promote
Phantombot is living its best life. Maybe an alternate universe by chance?
I had to change computers. Did Rigby finish?
strimmer is hiding us, post JoelPride
Bowser is an asshole today it seems
yeah he forgot ultra boots check
Looks like I showed up just in time
or should i say the check that give ultra boots KEKW
he did get it after he dnf
Make sure to sub to Phantom on Twitch
this was a seed alright YEP
was so good then it was so ass
the ultra hammer location was gross
instead your heartrate is ridiculously high?
yeah if i was racing this seed i would of skip water stone check NotLikeThis
he didn't go back for it right away
Wario Mario has too much bling reflecting off
i still haven't beat my 1st pape mw still waiting on 1 item phanto274Smile
Mine today poor Daltior mismarked which chapters to beat
oh i remember now you load this up and said nope KEKW
this is like a ghost for real
GOOMBARIO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS
Shit, I walked right into that one
Imagine Goombario... No I don't want to I'm stopping there
At least have Goombario to speed this up
Makes sense to me. I would fry things in the desert Kappa
you ever speed ran ttyd? wondering if any% is any fun
Runs so nice you'd do them twice
I was about to ask Dooplis
I think his full name is actually Parakathaniel
Yeah, that's why he goes by Parakarry
Ew we're riding the train? WutFace
i heard that there's a new movie coming to the mushroom kingdom, Parakawrence of Dry Dry Desert
@mirby_studios I heard it like, 6 hours long
yeah it's long, but i hear that Peter O'Toad is playing the title character with Alec Guin S. costarring
she made the crystal tree poop out Parakristopher
That ankle high grass is a menace
did I miss that cosmetic existing or is it new?
then yea I just was dummy never saw it
yeah I was thinking a good location would be Parakarry for when you finally get that letter
seems like the most painful place to go fo rnow
Holy crap I think the massive tphundo race fried my gamecard.
Vanilla means you never need to upgrade them
Ok we are back. How did the 1st hr go?
the 10 hp bowser fight is hope for fire right?
in the mw  i am doing i have 5 hp 50 fp and 30 bp and i have to level up 1 more time
NotLikeThis  my bounce start at 3 i have no damage Sadge
i need him to use fire
oh now he want to use fire
Tiger im sorry you got Goombario
bowser was a asshole but only use 1 life shroom the whole fight so i guess that was a good fight
funny thing is i had 6 life shroom and 6 repel gels KEKW
damn i had no power rush in my seed
also no all or nothing or p up d down guess beta badges yeet other badges out of the item pool
NODDERS shooting stars and t rages are so good when you have no damage
Sup! I Always forget about the damn Sundays lol.
also i am never playing progressive scaling ever again that was so ass
1 time was enough i just wanted to try pape ap then 2 days later it got a update YEP
i was Sadge i didn't get to finish my seed
the ap i just did was 36 seeds and it took a week to finish well 1 person haven't beat they seed yet
i was checking out kh2 for ap then found out it was for the pc version nooooo
yeah i was checking that out too since both was on my maybe list
well its 64.99 can fuck no i have the ps4 version already
i was hoping the rando was based off the jp ps2 version
I have never played a single kingdom hearts game
if kh 1 and 2 go on sale for epic shit store for like 5 bucks sure
you should play re:chain of memories. It plays like a 3D battle network KEKW
i played that 1 got to final boss and couldn't win
deck building, summons, its own version of PAs, ect.
i played so much kh2 back on ps2 a very very long time ago
you see the problem was you was playing part 1
and also the worlds for 1 was bad
like the  tarzan world was so bad
maybe you went the other way hmm
i do enjoy turn based better
tales of the abyss was my fav
wish they would remaster it  Sadge
last good tales game was berseria
one of the best mc for sure
my top 3 1 abyss 2 graces 3 berseria
but i got to say berseria had the best mc in a tales game
everyone LOVES  vesperia i think it trash
but is you damage gonna be as low as mine KEKW
i got to say you did way more damage then me KEKW
please bowser i want to go to Bedge
was a nice late night stream
i am raiding my Bedge so
am i first to a legendary phantom stream??
Ahh, one of the legendary nostalgia games
you can get a yaml for pape with a setting string now and its doesn't work for me Sadge
its really easy to do but its doesn't work just genning a seed with basic setting
i have rolled over 10 seeds shit just doesn't work and i have change settings each time
don't even have to look at the log to know if it say 195 items its didn't work should be 245 items
just race with dojo and panels
maybe it just 1 thing on that its doesn't like
oh wait a min i might know why
Yo, Phantom. Quick question: when do you usually know if you have a good or bad seed?
Anything different in this setting string?
There is a trainer hidden away on cycling road, don't forget that one
I don't have much to say, today. It's lovely to see you, though.
Have any trainers had progression yet
Time to go find a wild Vulpix.
cant believe you didn't name my fav pokemon after me peepoLeave
how's the seed cookin so far?
and I assume the lucky eggs are equipped PrideLaugh
A gym leader's badge on a random route will always be funny. LUL
I rolled myself a garbo MMR seed which I think imma just let go
required first bow into bombers minigame for deku paired with great bay tingle having moons tear to get hookshot in south clock town
and it just goes on from there logic wise
also casino for go mode mirror shield always is great phanto274Smile
that was by design - the only outlier is the space center
Alrighty. I'm off. Until next time~ <3
even if blaziken would be a bad mon imo that would have been worth the pick PrideLaugh
did I just see blaziken having leaf blade? PrideLaugh
yo sonic boom PrideLaugh good move KappaPride
(early levels it might be good but eh)
now triage on the chikorita line would be fancy
"local trainer turned into barry from SInnoh, running into everyone to get their lunch money and related belongings"
yea looks like a magikarp fan in vanilla
at least wild ass backtracks cant happen on this one
yep, because ya got fly PrideLaugh
if at all its short quick travels to places
as for why the pool is givin you so many "decent" items: normally with trainer shuffle added in, you get a bunch of money items as replacer - I chose not to have the item pool be fludded with that and set it to be a diverse itempool instead
bets otherwise you'd have like 40+ sellable items like tiny shrooms and pearly by now
"thanks for talking to me, have a balance badge BEFORE it self destructs!" KEKW
first one to slay oneself, then one to MAYBE hit the other end if they want to be hit KEKW
now all that is missing is explosion
truthfully, blaziken just needs to learn EQ
and that thick club will have a glorious home
geez, how many double battles were in gen3
oh, that's part of the trainersanity setting?
its part of the settings as is
I see. Really speeds things up.
which I'm sure was the point
How are ya feeling about Emerald rando? I feel like there's a lot to remember
it wasn't much better in gen 5 either
which you CAN unlock some of that story locking
you can set the route blocking grunts to not be a thing - just that with the region based on water, surf around the corner - having them restricts the seed from just blasting you into "whole map casino" bc you had found surf + balance badge early
Yeah it's a balance between linear and completely open
allows for a cocuple more puzzles within the non water routes
you using the poptracker? I imagine that would help learn. I'm hoping to try this at some point soon
you also need to see where the sub was and run through it just to see weather wars for the rayquaza flags to be there
I don't know Emerald very well.
dont know if berries / trainers are on a more recent poptracker pack though
yeah totally get it. I like the poptracker for connecting to AP, most of them have one.
"oh no different" - the most common of complaints
technically you can do that on Emotracker too
just that emotracker ppl havent done much with
cus emotracker CAN connect to things
also emotracker I heard getting a map pack validated so its searchable is a bit of a paintrain
though definitely more convenient to use
things might have opened up there then - I heard it being "a hassle" a couple years ago so *shrug*
people probably just like to complain
rolled a diff seed btw: yea that interview + camereman double isnt in the check list
which other routes even have these
but curiosity + poking at same settings diff seed for answers
yea cant see that reporter + cameraman combo in there either - whatever their names would be though
could also be bc its 2 trainers in 1 fight always
to avoid confusion of "why did 2 trainers turn into one check here"
I'd guess its purely because near to all the other double battles in rando can be done as single battle instead
trainers as checks in red/blue rando are a bit annoying
cus then you have to fight them then talk to them afterwards for the item
or at least it was like that last I heard about it
which was like.. roughly 9mo ago give / take
so grain of salt, not certain that its still like that
technically you always get "money" but its instead turned into items
guess I coulda set the goal to be steven PrideLaugh
the levels would not be a problem
just to see what he'd get
which to an extent was by choice given doubles otherwise crunch the exp down to no good growth
even with having to fight everyone
cus steven is 80s range team
oh you know what - my theory why the reporter + cameraman doubles arent in the pool doesnt make sense
cus these 2 have an item
do you have a flamethrower tm?
so you could just mess around with it
what was the precond for eruption to be better then flamethrower again?
so its like status + hex over shadow ball
wanted to say - the only real "hassle" is dragon types which you can just tri attack psychic against
the same but with surf hits both yea
it do be a bunch of trainers down there too at least
not just the small amount of items
I dont think that is always there
lemme check the junked checks though rl quick whether I did that right
should just be maxie up here
yea I did junk those 2 grunts
so they'll just have extra nonsense / similar "nonsense" as the rest of the "this isnt prog" items
spoiler only lists 2 existing up at Mt chimney excluding maxie though as "team magma grunt 1" and 2 respectively
and both are in the junk block
ohhhh there's also a magma ADMIN up there
hence why I didnt even think there'd be 3 trainers of team magma there
there are a couple trainers up there which arent team magma though
given you fought the singled out one though: you didnt miss a thing
as in: that admin was overlooked in being turned junk
but you fought them so *shrug* cant be a lingering "whoopsie" on that
good that that became a point of "huh?" though
gonna edit the yaml block rl quick
not that it can affect this seed
good badge + hm combos at least though
holding L / R to scroll by page
which I THINK gen4 onwards has had?
I definitely renember it existing just dont know which gen it was that added it
further left there's 2 trainers and an item no?
I think up near the hiker further left is a small island w 2 trainers and item between them yea
ohhh that explains why I renember these 2 then
cus I always play with hidden items
not 100% on them but like - "more thing to do" brain
Got my last performance for food court. I was criticized for being loud enough that opposite end of the warehouse heard me bellowing order numbers
sup chat / stream and YouTube
that.. do be some loud shouting depending on size of the place + noise in it ye
when the checks run away PrideLaugh
tbf, these people are NOT listening, then complain they haven't received their order
@buff00n sounds like "average customers" to me yea
I guess the good thing is when they dont turn into karens on it
or they order something, walk away for 5-10 minutes then wonder where's their order when we had it ready yonks ago
that makes sense why I didnt know then PrideLaugh
i did 1 last time was fun
for that $4.99* YOU can join in the multiworld shenanigans
you see i am broke KEKW
if I wouldnt be VERY restricted, I would
*$5.99 on twitch mobile, for SOME reason
aka "haha lmao dont look up anything price related on phone ever"
and for some reason its 9 bucks in Canada
sad that blaziken isnt fire flying
i don't have prime rn HUH
otherwise aerial ace would be noms
might Okami since it's on sale atm. Watching you play it got me wanting to play it again
i haven't had prime for 4 months
PSA: Don't pay full price for Capcom games. There WILL be a sale where it's dirt cheap
literally me sitting here waiting for KH series on steam
I caught my sale on Trials of Mana, that's all I cared about from them.
over it being on epic games on a harsher price tag then for consoles ever since it got pushed to there
a) I wouldnt buy it there even if it would be reasonably priced, but also b) blech on that double price bullshit they pulled
like - imagine a game costing 40 to 50 bucks costing double cus its squeenix + didney on epic blech store (sorry, I didnt have a better word in mind for epic games but also f epic)
i got prime for 1 buck for a week when i got my ssd but i did save money getting prime
Spotify keeps nagging me to come back, but I've got YouTube Premium, so YouTube Music has been VERY good to me
I didn't know that was a thing
studio versions for just casual playbacks over live versions definitely is a mood yea
and understandable cus audio quality can be VERY hit / miss on live over studio
thats like when ya find a song you like but only through some random person's phone upload of them recording with wobbly camera and shit mic
which isnt even their fault, just phone mics arent intended to record audio at high qualities
I liked the 2 patches of sonic boom right next to another
i am still very confuse about just having prime somehow
"yo what a nice sonic boom farm you have going here! - wait, why are there speakers in the ground?!"
know what I am hoping for with this seed?
cus then there's a bunch of trainers there
it doesnt, but it do be lv. 40s trainers at least
which the only other spot in the game where thats a thing is what, E4?
Vic Road is what I meant yea
cus E4 is 50s to 60s
like - a LOT of gen3 is just washed out levels cus of "yo I can surf anywhere, gotta account for it"
the biggest which I renember truthfully would be gen5
cus you get a pre-E4 Ghetsis and all that
guess i will be joining the MW
BW post game having a 10 to 15 Level jump was ABSURD
@buff00n playing respectively either with challenge node active makes that jump not be that much a thing - when shit goes up to 80s
thought btiger meant MidWest for a sec, was VERY confused
which - I kinda still wanna try and play challenge mode through one of them at some point
slugma said "slugma balls" - it intimidated both the blaziken and the ghostly gengar 🤣
I was already fighting for my life wandering around the postgame then I find Cynthia just waiting to murder me for bumbling into someone's house
fuckin ligma setup and a half that ability combo
to be fair: I did like the circle over what shenaniganry gen6 was
that one path blocked by Sudowoodo that links 3 different areas to one another
fair - I just didnt gel with gen6 and then didnt bother with any of the other gens after
could not tell you why specifically though
and then you get a sudden interrupt again - I distinctly renember I have X but never got past 8th gym
just didnt feel like it rly
Gen 6: You wanna fight 4 friends / rivals, back-to-back?
and still not have a Battle Frontier/Subway
which to an extent: feels like gamefreak pulled a monHun on that
just that monHun had loads of content added, and not just like "a couple routes / trainers, done"
at least, the Rainbow Rocket stuff
2 grunts lower floor, 3 on higher floor junked
I didn't play USUM. Didn't want to replay the same game again
at least so close to the release of the other one
i had moon and never beat it KEKW
Game Freak went out of their way to rewrite Lusamine.
I did NOT junk the olivine rival in front of the shopping center
just as a heads up given its otherwise an easily skipped fight
Meanwhile, Special / Adventures went: "What if we made Lusamine even WORSE than she was in OG Sun / Moon???"
nah I mean "out of adge" buff00n PrideLaugh
is that a sandstorm summoning slowking? KEKW
right, lilicove is that its called
these trainers rly do be thanos snapping themselves with the items they give you after you win KEKW
it would be hilarious if cut is on one of the dive spot items, but nothing good behind it so its fine for it to be a junk item KEKW
I know SMILERS like with dive depending on how this seed wants to play
need to add in an overkill message
IT WAS A SPECIAL X PLOSION KEKW
happy that that isnt a thing given silly bogus like simple bibarel with sword dance exist in gen4 SMILERS
give that thing aqua jet, it has fun sweeping for nonsense reasons
and then to mt pyre first or directly to magma hideout for the haha funny run through their belongings?
got it - this purely me being curious given routing decisions
cus I only did like what, 3 or so emerald seeds
and in MMR its easy to fall onto the "go mode route" -> "well shit where is my 1 casino item" trap
do keep in mind inside magma hideout on 4F is another Madma Admin Tabitha somewhere
not junked cus I assumed given the maxie fight there is a double as is
that she'd just join up w maxie
but its listed as separate items
which I think is solved easier in Aqua hideout as you have to fight admin matt in there for the submarine to go on a cruise
so.... did that random fight just withdraw chinchou
to then bring back out the same chinchou?
OHH I think I know how it happened?
cus arena trap should affect your partner mons?
cus thats a player cant do thing KEKW
it had a "well shit my turn got eaten" moment
because basically what that in terms of what a player can do would be is looking at team to exchange mon but then going back out of the menu
if only dragon wasnt special, one could teach that potentially to blaziken for dragon coverage
cus fuck having to do puzzly gyms 5 times
thats oddly close to where it would be KEKW
inb4 the SS ticket is in the safari KEKW
the middle of the item list is the worst to get to
cus top / bottom you can scroll all the way up / down to cycle to the other end at least
may I be curious what the encounters in here would be? DinoDance
bye whatever the encounter pools would have been
inb4 its filled with latias/latios and other some such
however I think some of them block paths to items
though unsure if thats hidden item related
must be hidden item related then
oh look a santa clause laughin at you over the training ground in mt pyre PrideLaugh
or are those not the "ether" berries?
hey - there's a time for everything - just means that the e4 cant just turn into a revive test KEKW
and tbh with the exp curve being where I set it to be I am happy if I see mid 70s on the 2nd slot
its not that big a difference yea
the berries just exist as extra things
and the reason imo that this whole thing flows is cus higher exp curve meaning less need to run in circles
anyone else not caring for ANY sports related game much?
just got a 2k25 ad and uhh - sure I guess those games exist
the tm check from her ye - fuck searching for a specific type mon
just makes for cruelty if its super buried
its not modified to the point of no back tracks if hidden items or trainers are on yea
or at least I dont think you can single cycle this route
with trainers maybe you also can still
Oh no, is trainersanity that the items are with all the trainers?
right - I shoulda made self-sending items
so you could just do this
not the ones in "gym" areas though
aka within gyms as well as most of the grunts from evil teams
this seed rly has it out for ya KEKW
Wait, does it add in more items then? Or are there just less regular checks?
technically in this case, it would fill the seed with lots of money items
but the item pool is set to be "diverse" so its actually "useful" items
whether they truly are is up for debate obv.
That's cool, I didn't know there were these options. Is this through Archipelago or just a rom randomizer?
I still need to dig into Archipelago
there is the option of just doing a universal pokemon rando of this game
though it doesnt shuffle the key items around
so your bikes are still where bikes are, so are rods, badges hms
yea there's no standalone logic based rando
its more of a "chaos = fun" variant
here's a silly ether which I love
teaching not used tms over used ones to refill pp
then teach back around (only works with having reusable tms
the admin I reckon just teams up with maxie
would have to be that then
definitely a "whoops I messed up" because I didnt think that the admins of team magma would be singled out
anyway my brain thought admin tabitha in here would join up as a double
so that's a "I did whoopsies"
cus respectively both admin fights you did as extras I thought would join up with maxie
glad they didnt have a thing though
no clue why this order of opertions is needed
also for aqua hideout: the admin in there also isnt junk (my assumption for that is that thats the trainer in there triggering the sub to go cruising)
given there's no "aqua leader" labeled fight in aqua hideout
ok so didnt mess this area up then
just the 2 magma areas where its a bit dumb for this seed
(noted down in the yaml I got on my end if I ever go and do a seed like this)
also unless I messed up the dive corner items should all be junked
will you come up with your own parody to "It's Gonna Be Me" on may 1st?
Magby wasn't going down without an attempted fight
fingers crossed btw on these wide as fuck routes that no hides horribly like
the reason I turned it on
cus fuck being forced into fighting anything but the boss in the gyms
espeeeecially given you can skip them in some gyms as is
this one, the fire hop / fall gym whats the name
space center: the one spot where I wasnt certain which grunt would be where
gonna go get some corny pops
so happy to know the trainers you are interacting with in there
wait no that sounds like the cereal...i mean popcorn
cus none of them up here are junk
member how this was the one spot where I didnt kno w for certain who's who and all
yea and the one before the stairs
given you got the ap client open, whats the one before stairs named?
cus these 3 up here would most likely be 1, 2, 3
ohhh I renember why I didnt know who's who in there
its cus they all are numbered
cus they only had 1 through to 7 as the labels there
time to mess up metangs moveset tippiTap
In 3rd gen double battles, can confusion make you attack the your teammate?
cmon phantom this isnt a 3v1 KEKW
Makes sense I guess, it would be a lot of coding for an edge case
also this arcanine having fire blast for a second looked scary
it only list magma grunts on the check list
but maybe they disappear once all of them are fought
OR its chosen that way because of how these otherwise could disappear and there's no dynamic room change option
gonna assume that cant be a seed lock
but also IF it is, there HAS to be a way to change room layout in that specific room properly
"Hello, I am trying to reach out to you about your wailmer's extended warranty, HELLOOOO!"
woah is that a coherent bot message?
missed just one word to make it
I just imagined how cursed a 0 partner boss shuffle run would be
this gengar got fed superb coverage barring ICE BEAM
only thing for more HP and spDef woulda been a wailord
gooo blaziken, reach lv. 70s before E4
imagine being a kid with no repels and accidentlally jumping down there
imagine being a kid and jumping down there in  general
just imagine being a kid let loose on the world with animals shouting their names everywhere and there being a valid option for some of them to just casually cause tectonic plates to move
imagine being a kid of a parent who said okay at 10 to explore the world at different levels
again: with animals which are capable to just terraform the planet for shits
not being kidnapped in the lost woods
cant wait to see whether your waterfall is on the benny hills routes or in some trainers pockets
hey at least they cant be in the safari, right?
that'd be a painful time to deal with if dexsanity would be on
definitely not a "short seed" type setting
but a fun one depending on what the goal of the seed is
i thought that said giglar...like giggle
as long as you don't call me late for dinner
too lazy to type out janitor lolz
uh oh...you gotta go get dinner dude
did you have to buy many extra repels or is this still feeding off the starting items?
hey, they implied they were the local champion
maybe they played an AP seed and thats their BK island
but their seed got abandoned, so they are just in permanent BK mode
where's sight - I mean - knuckle badge
and Imma guess he had a numel
scizor sure does not like fire moves
Are we last checking and praying? :smirk:
there's still a couple routes with good checks
just 1 item from go mode why not check vic road entry
its currently a "flash / knuckle badge" logic gate
gl Phantom on that last badge 👊🏻
it cant be where its dark KEKW
at least E4 will have hilarious items on them
I want to see dive on the E4
Bet you wish you had a Farfetch’d right now Kappa
better then tons of tiny mushrooms
bets its in the safari SMILERS
also a smidge late for a pivot to latios
I mean the speed and defense would still be a bit lower right
cus its like what, basically assault vest for latios / latias without the drawback of only attacking moves available?
so yea your speed and potentially defenses would have a small thing to say then
by this point I want to say that its hopefully not behind weather wars in sootopolis
are e4 vanilla levels or what does the scaling look like?
just the self gained exp is slightly higher then base
lemme get the number rl quick
Ah, so it’s inevitable as soon as you find the badge
so its slightly above normal but not big time
cus normally the route trainers are less high level to the gyms coming after
therefore less exp then if you were to interact with the gyms and grunts from the evil teams
so my brain was like "okay, time to just set this curve slightly higher and start phantom with lucky eggs"
fuck the game's numbers being able to outclass by random ability + stats cus rando chose where you have to be
could be because of the item pool truthfully
cus the "diverse" item pool takes the entirety and adjusts it
so its not a guarantee to get the vanilla pool + extras necessarily
how many tms of what do you have by this point too KEKW
cus like - tms paired with reusable tms REALLY should not be able to be in the pool more then once imo
good thing this is the triple of routes one has to go through twice anyway
ah yes the flying whale LUL
Water was looking out for you COPIUM
it even gave the appropriate herb KEKW
aka "turn benny hills trainers or items off" for this subset of settings truly
cus it kinda turns this area into sootopolis gym under the main path
hope the reference hopefully makes sense
body slam would be better then tri attack, no?
fingers crossed that they arent behind the 1 dive hole
if ONLY shiftry would have special attack
that moment when you stare at the devon goods in yourpockets
dont think I junked these 2 btw since they are always necessary for devon goods turn in
it gave you scott for pokenav, not that that ever matters
then a couple spots on the route south of mt pyre
isnt there like 1 thing left of mauville too?
I don’t know the rando well enough to know what it changes
it was always on for the items on the ground
cus they are technically just items
but as said: didnt want phantom to run in circles in there given trick house = trick house
so I just said "yep junk this stuff"
and SO FAR you have not been punished for it
they have been in before berries and trainers even
what I would also think would make sense for trick house
is to make it a separate toggleable setting
because its a BUNCH of HM specific puzzles
Well add a broken door to the checkmark on my bucket list.
Hope things are better for u
and while its somewhat easy to do them, its a) long, b) can be confusing, c) doesnt make for cozy ride if it ends up being the only thing you can do because of a huge lock on traversal somehow
like say, vanilla HM compat, no pokemon can learn surf
and no rock smash to get north
they 100% are in the spoiler
and imma assume its just never been added?
Sounds like another project for you Phantom YEPSPIN
@Amishman19 listen - its "just" a bit of json editing
plus setting flags right which are already present in other files
hell, I would even dare say given the trick house rooms are not too big one could make do without area submaps
they definitely are long checks compared to most of the other things yea
also never were on the sandstorm route no?
as well as left of fortree the couple things
when does it pick to make certain battles double that aren’t usually?
its currently set to 100% doubles chance
other then that, it's a luck based setting you can enable / disable
ah so if the trainer has 2 or more it’s always doubles
Makes sense to speed it up
and because its at 100%, I just said "you know what, 1.5x exp bc double battles usually drain exp down into not existing"
lust let the level curve not turn into a problem
also acro bike > mach bike imo
acro is fun to mess around with though
I like how acro allows for different movement while being faster
as well as (as a casual in dpad movement) it not being near as quick as mach makes it easier not to bonk anywhere
where did you rmoney go KEKW
you had 19k at some point KEKW
guess ya just need to sell some of your dupe tms then KEKW
Is the giga drain giver junked or so you need a grass type here?
fuck searching for a grass type
didnt want to hold the seed hostage by encounter RNG
the one thing which sucks: petalburg gym I did junk all trainers which are not norman
but you still NEED to move through a couple of them to reach nrman
Imagine all the repels you can buy now!
(to be fair, trainer shuffle with normal item pool doesnt give you this many tms
I just chose for it to be diverse rather then filling phantom up with mushrooms pearls and nuggets)
that is not within my control with the toggle PrideLaugh
also what IMO is more interesting with this is that you have higher odds of getting decent battle items early rather then being bound by whatever your items early on give ya
as in diverse over vanilla item pool
so resident evil 2 remake have a ap MW i just found out about
I'd rather have it be "useful" junk then "sell this shit" junk
@blacktiger51 RE1, 2, 3 remakes I think yea
i might have to try it 1 day
yeah i join that discord to see the 18 plus game
I could swear its all 3
1 2 and 3 does have randos
RE 3 also has an AP world
pretty sure there only 1 xxx game in the discord
its been existent for a bit, to keep it pg for non 18+ games
thats about the entire reason of it rly
sent ya the link I am lookin at blacktiger
damn its 3 remake that game is trash
hey - I didnt say which version of RE3 it was PrideLaugh
this is like that hit game from 2009
i also have re 2 remake on stream so i could do it
I dont know btw if there are any trainers behind being able to dive up on the routes where the dive related items were junked
i was hoping for og 2 maybe 1 day
notes given specifically dive was meant to not hold much value with these side paths: knowing which one is where so the respective dive locked trainers can be junked alongside the items on the way they are on
cus uhhh yea my bad if it ends up being there
the pc version of og 2 have tons of mods for it so maybe phanto274Bless
@blacktiger51 honestly at this point somewhat unlikely for super old games where remasters exist to hit AP imo
cus like - KH2 theoretically should be able to be PS2 compat, but never was done
technically imo it would also make sense to just have the old and the remake as options
but you see jon the og version for  resident evils are better for rando
because I assume given what I saw in RE4R, that there's also a decent chunk of difference
but the remake for 1 is better for rando then og 1
meaning it would play somewhat differently in rando over vanilla differences
I cant speak to any of that - never played the first ones
like - I played OG 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
remake 1 have full room rando as well
and uhhh - RE4 I personally prefer OG RE4 over remake version just because "why change up the maps so much"
time to see the silly items here
also blaziken? I am disappointed, you're 7 levels below 70
you could technically make the remake work with that sort of transition kinda foggate like
problem is if it isnt easily doable
way easier to work with the og pc version since modders been working with them for years
plus crapcom being crapcom, with their current vendetta after the nude chun li mod in regards to mods and re-introducing DRM prot into age old games...
my brain's just at "its definitely doable, just how much of a hassle would it be"
i mean you could just make mr x go anywhere
my guess there goes towards "if one were to figure that out", you could make it be a delayed spawn with lenience for distance between player to where player last came from"
so kinda similar to the TP wall / floormasters which hold the twili temple balls
either by forcing "behind" or "x seconds after entry of room, Mr.X appears from an entrance in this new arbitrary room"
with weighting towards "behind you" rather then "in front of you" once on chase
that all being said, definitely a hassle and a half
just my brain havin been sitting on "technicalities one can make if one wants to" as much as it would change the feel of the game slightly
thankya for not being against phantom winning KEKW
kinda sounds like a certain turtle normally
and torkoal is fire type yea
it was quite literally just "what if every overworld trainer has your items"
that was the entire reason of these settings
sorry for the slight messups on tabitha related
i think trainersanity is only good for a MW
the flags to be fair are not settings related problems though
i think you can remove some npc blocking your way
yea but not the ones phantom is talking about
the ones you can move are 111 and 119 mostly
not towards the surf routes and mossdeep
so magma / aqua hideout you cant just cheap out of
weather wars you cant skip out of
you need to do a roundabout basically
dont forget "why do I need to do all that then weather wars and calming to enter sootopolis"
cus you NEED to do the small submarine cave after
talk to steven and such, so you can go to sky pillar
just to then go back around
the only reason for you to do it
would be if your goal is a legendary hunt
and you NEED to get the rayquaza encounter
all the way to slateport honestly moreso
instead of the back and forth from petalburg to the cave then back to boat and back around again
I dunno - I can see your point but it feels very similar
phantom: I did send blacktiger a link a bit ago
lemme send it to you rl quick in rando if you dont mind?
cus I think I know what you'd end up doing next PrideLaugh
did you see what marioman psoted?
yeah so i wasn't crazy KEKW
My PC Bluescreened like 5 minutes ago
It was, but tomorrow is a new day
Who paid you to play Pokémon Unite?
Should bring Chucky to the camera to say hi
Um... Monado was in the middle of a run... did something horrifying happen and he bolted?
How are you doing and what are we doing today?
your bed? that his Bedge now
So it's not Zelda randomizer league, it's a Paper Mario league?
hows jcog? not seen a stream gor a while
think the latest just was a bunch off pc tech shenaniganry rly
I wish my cat would get a job! -Midnight makes biscuits- What a good baker boi.
yea thats a lot of being alone
(cus yea cats get lonely and bored veeery quick)
as much as snoozin is also a lot of a cats day
hey hey hey phantom phantom phantom did you know did you know did you know If you use a controller that isnt a Gamecube controller, you can put your finger into your shirt and roll around the buttons quicker than just using your finger alone. this reduces the friction a lot not just a little a lot but by a lot a lot Cheer100
yea just sounds like cat things
if only the cloth fibers would do the controllers much good KEKW
oh I know which section you're at then
the tug of war in the pit
yeah, thats when I dropped the game in January
dont you use your belly button for quick controller mashing?
I thought it'd be the pterodactyl flying section
I dont think I even recall that being a huge mashing thing
only ever thought the flying section to be the one culprit of "oh yea shit"
you're playin this on wii right?
that explains why it looks so suuuuuper dark on the capture
dunno why, but console the dark caves do be lots darker - like how there's that whole dark filter over the N64 zeldas for some reason on wii / wii u / switch compared to N64
fingers crossed its not a mighty surfin open seed but instead more of a puzzle
also wanna say fuck arrows somehow losing all of their velocity in water in this game
as much as its normal for that to be a thing vanilla
would you believe me if I were to say that I did not immediately think of this cave when you mentioned those 2 items? KEKW
somehow it completely blanked out of my mind
"are we in dark world yet?"
I was joking when I said health cave
well now it completed a heart container and gave 2 of the what, 7 existing in the seed?
why did I not just look at your broadcast view to say how many heart containers the pool has KEKW
its sooooo easy to do that accidentally on the last corridor
I always just wing it and then get keese'd into the walk of shame back
lets hope thse bombs are enough
alright, know im done with the TP manga
I heard about the ones for OoT and MM, but not about after
its the longest one being 11 volumes
how feels the run so far?
it ran for 7 years and ended a yaer ago
how many spheres can this game even bring to the table realistically.... like... mayyyybe on a super deep chain like 15?
just tryin a think cus while spheres dont mean "difficult" necessarily, linearity is described rather well by it at least
to be fair: you always have to do right side first unless you have clawshot
cus the rose monkey only goes to the right, and the one from the pillar brings ya left
the 2 jumping around from feels are just fluff
POGGIES i just won a giveaway
for a star rail battlepass or 20 bucks
it would have thrown a fit on "shit"
they do have the "highlighted clips" feature yea
where on a channel if you as the broadcaster selected some as highlights, it would overshadow past broadcasts
suurely that will come in handy
your sphere zero is kinda bustin isnt it KEKW
as much as I hate that I phrased it that way
I could also just send you a vid in rando for that as reference
its one of the easier setups
bit harder is skipping dominion rod in kak gorge land with a double LJA cus the 2nd one is a bit... roughhie
mortal draw aka the "is this how darknuts work" skill for me
mainly because vanilla, I never tried just shieldbash helm splitter on them
mortal draw is good for one shotting that one miniboss that gives you ball and chain
does it just ohko that one? O.o
like - no setup nothing just does it?
it do be looking like it yea
love btw how you're also like "whats tracking health" with the heartpieces and containers
as much as I respect it being on the trcker, its such a "why" thing to my brain
in mm there are a few things locked behind health, but the rando just patched those to not have a health requirement
again: this game has health reqs on anything? what
Ice puzzles are neat when done right and only once
technically this is the only ice puzzle
funky how that never got decouples
yea well... technically MM has health logic for secret shrine
but it got decoupled from it VERY quickly
cus 16 heart containers is a lot
and you being forced to do the rooms in order 4/8/12/16 is also bleh
tfw not running glitchless to know how to do this puzzle
isnt this puzzle just a bunch of going in circles
also yea it sure does save it because otherwise how would switches stay pressed
i can just send you a video on how to do it
but id like them even more if they didnt take so long
I kinda dont mind them because once you do them a couple times they just flow
yes its still longer thing to do but also "eh"
does OoT have an ice dungeon?
do you want the first switch or the second switch solution
what time is your race supposed to start today?
I swear links short walk ledgegrabs are SUCH a menace to pressing A by accident if you wanna go for a roll jumo
can skip those small mini cutscenes by ball&chain btw
wanna know something funny about oococoos
they in german are called "Tante" aka "aunt"
how and why? I cant tell ya
but t hey are called that
wish I'd know how he works without
i think if you stand near his butt he throws it
on this instance that wouldnt help
because this would give the reward as a separate item to the hear container
dungeons where that works are only arbiters and PoT
lobby HP chest and upstairs roundabout which needs clawshot too yea
that being said you could junk those 2 instead
if you wanna keep variety in dungeons a thing I mean
hi, just got back home from the movies, real sleepy but take this
twitch lemme use my prime holy shit
so my local arthouse cinema announced they're starting a queer movies night series
and everyone was encouraged to come in fab or pink
I don't have any non-warm pink clothes rn so I whipped my pink wig out
and then there was a pop quiz and I actually won one of the prizes
I also yeeted someones beer with my butt while moving down the aisle oops
then some drag queens came and did more quizzes
I insta bought 2 tickets for their upcoming show
the spinner is such a dumb item
I wish the spinner was better outside of rails
I might have made a mistake and turned on hidden items
also I heard a lot of "dorf fights be like" 😅
back from errands just in time, good luck! phanto274GL
also marioman thanks for posting that would of been Madge if i couldn't cheat again KEKW
magapaul is streaming on twitch rn
Would we be interested in a race winner GAMBA perhaps? phanto274Thonk
Definitely would do a long-term one, yeah
Alright, time to see where chat's allegiances lie
every damn timewith the 7 scaling
gl! hope you use all of your good luck today!
it is the strongest partner ability against a single enemy
wow can’t believe a goomNUT fell out of that oasis tree
would fan smack hurt chapter 4 boss or does it go to 1 or 0
not a blue key seed! Kappa
Is that one Laki jump on Rugged allowed?
for the letter and farther item
Gl with the race, I be at work
they went to check the place with the things
wait since when have I been VIP?
oh right! I won like 85K on one random GAMBA
Speaking of GAMBA there's one going on right now, only a few minutes left to predict
at least I'm not the only bet on Phantom now KEKW
I'm sure everyone in chat is a believer at heart, some just may not be able to resist the thrill of a potential payout
oh yeah I just didn’t want someone to only be getting coins from me if they won the GAMBA
the lure of the GAMBA is strong
Gotta get more token involved GAMBA
Last call for GAMBA, GAMBA closing soon
minimal cutscenes have made it so awkward to not have laki for the first room
I HATE when I don’t have either of them for this situation, feels so bad
Imagine rolling 1256 and never finding bombette and parakarry LUL
how big of a thing of sour cream do you need
i feel like 8 oz is plenty, as for cheese?
"smacking the baby would have been better"
came in to some very interesting commentary
required Odd Key on Shrink Stomp KEKW
awww man... spicy soup sounds pretty good... it's like stormy and chilly out and everything
we have a decent amount of rice still yeah?
ah ok 15 pounds is plenty LOL
I'll but the next bag we get at some point
Is that a cat on the bed?
right I need to learn that one still
I didn’t know you had a cat
it's not bad for a Laki TP but not really free imo
how much harder is it than peach warp NSingman? (the only other laki tele I know KEKW )
i never try it since i always seem to have parakarry here
you find a spot along the bottom wall that generally works and hop on Laki when you reach the corner
Okay that’s not too bad then
the spot you jump on him matters a bit so it can be slightly more awkward than peach warps
but it's the same spot you drop with parakarry essentially\
I’m bad at not really realizing where I’m lining up for a Flarakarry and just doing it though
I just got hit with the item collect + chest softlock KEKW
(that was for the star rod tune if it wasn't obvious, no spoilies)
@MarioManTAW oh no big RIP, I'm scared every time I'm in there
he was fighting ch4 boss when you was fighting jr
lmao I didn't realize how bad the power rush BP was
I'll show you tomorrow! (I won't)
and both of the badges are still worth at 8bp KEKW
gg again ty for the stream!
damn i came in as its ending!!!
i have 3 ap MW plan this month YEP
I just finished my Emerald Seed
Love me some original Paper Mario
Truly a race for the times
yo gl on the race Phantom! phanto274GL
all that gl practice is paying off for him for sure
I don't have audio on rn but gl brother
Phantom says ty for the gl :D
So it seems pape race arc is commencing so silent chatty waters ahead.
I counted like a minute ago and it was 5 things like goddamn dude
Sounds like season 1 all over again
rowf settings being on = best blitz setting everrrrr
I love seeing luigi in action.
PB probably just barely out of reach with all of the ch7 travel but it's not completely out of the realm of possibility
you set the bar high lol
bruh this is an impossible time
GG on joining Rigby in the 1:20 club
that is definitely the fastest I've ever seen
and you said 133 is gonna be hard to beat YEP
you found warehouse key a lot earlier too
I see credits, so ggs to the seed!
oh u doing a seond afterall
completing a RAC run almost killed Press A
I was already subbed to Press A for the based Pikmin challenge runs
Help with anxiety? animal safe can I give it to my dog? she hates thunderstorms!!!!
@needaname37 our vet gives us gabapentin (sp?) for our anxious dog and we got her a thunder shirt from pet smart and it works well for her
holy based Shadow the Hedgehog June
you're going to get that DAMN fourth chaos emerald?
i did the ultra boots way to get that 1 check was very easy to get on the block
Season 46 of Survivor is fuckin nutty
im in my reality tv era
its like full on chaos :)
TIL the baby yoshis crying in paper mario is just a high pitched version of yoshis SMW sound effect.
the past seasons has been so "we-all-love-each-other-wow" and kumbaiya and boring
this one everyone hates each other
like they are all playing to win and it does not matter and this shit is so iconic
I'm very mixed on one end i hate doing glitches but on another i want the seed to be faster
60 star pieces for the cookbook? wtf game
i missed it where was the ultra boots
This seed is gonna drill and grill
SadgeBusiness i should really go beat rebirth soon
i haven't played for almost 2 weeks
oh its been 15 days since i last played it
yeah i got ff 16 and star wars jedi survivor on sale and i need to go back to star wars been 3 months
Damn, that is a great deal
good game just don't do side stuff
i bought it day 1 and loved it
I've made myself stop buying games unless I'm playing it thar day
Hmm, sounds like a familiar story to a certain cardstock-plumber series
dragon quest is still the same
tales of have change for the worst Sadge
How many of them are state farm ads?
When I grow up I want to be that big ass raven
Paper mario on a wednesday? Ooh
AND i dont have to work tommorow so I can watch :)
What options are the disabled for the (Almost)?
Woah. That's a lot of things on the tracker
guess you can't really beat 7 without kooper
has the same chances of the leafs winning the cup
I got my first sub 2
I got lucky at the end. I cleared 3 and 2, had everything I needed for 7, and on 2 clears badge shop had last 2 fortress keys. So I skipped all of 7
I threw a bunch of time tho cause I didnt mark super hammer LUL
maybe just a check you forgot about
want me to look at the log?
upgrade block parakarry check ultra boots chests and the block before boots chest
can you give letters without parakarry?
now you're taking over 2 hours?
Have you ever played paper mario ttyd 64.
i hope the ttyd release on the switch does well. maybe they will make a new game like the older ones
but it was not the greatest for a mario game
if they made another game like the first 2 PM's it would sell like mad
agreed. Enjoyed it more than Origami King anyway
i liked the open world type of Origami King however
they need to make more unique buddies. thats what makes the game fun for me at least
Im actually in the middle of 100%ing Origami King
Im also in the middle of doing Sticker star, which is also not a great PM game
arguably Super Paper Mario is my favourite, then OG then TTYD
Ive only ever played Bowsers Inside Story in that series, and it was an absolute blast
I play that one at least once every year or so
I hated the backtracking in Paper Jam
It feels like a new super mario bros game
Have you ever 100%ed Mario Odyssey?
im a completionist lol. I cant stand leaving a game uncompleted, maybe the Autism in me.
Odyssey was definitely a bit repetitive though
i like the randomizer as it changes the game up
it gives me a new perspective basically
depends on the game for me
that the reason i close everything in rando
Tears of the Kingdom wouldn't let me play Knuckles' Chaotix within the game, I can't do anything. 0/10
@PhantomGamesBot very odd thing to say after I mention Knuckles' Chaotix
Hi! Long time, some lurk, lots of YouTube viewing. Hope all is well
Good! It's May, which is somehow more stressful than December. But then. Summer
Kolorado being his usual useful self
I can't find the archipelago page that had Mario is Missing on it
I thought I saw someone post it in the discord
I only see the officially supported games
Is this required glitchless or for "fun"
I'm seeing Fire Emblem 8 in here
oh i didn't know Crystal have a ap
Is the work around to get into LP not count? Because I was confused. No judgments otherwise
Not making b the dumb circle rock break throug
1 day i might actually do a Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories ap
That makes a lot of sense
every card you get is a check not starchip only cards
you do play with a 15 card drop mod
so its doesn't sounds too bad
but final bosses is rng hell
i played it so much as a kid
never actually beat it without cheating tho
YEP not even close to how you play yugioh KEKW
Duel links was kinda fun for awhile
cuz its ocg list well getting closer to it
most people like yugioh pvp so that probably wont happened
i never played the tag force games
yeah cyber dragon was really good back then so ban
Should I eat cereal at 1235 am ??
One bowl of Trix coming up
That era of Yu-Gi-Oh was weird
YEP that was all that was out back then
we didn't get the good stuff until we got xyz cards
Or should I say... zap mail
i am so bad at mashing power shock on him
Hello! It was fun. Got to try out FF6: Worlds Collide today and quickly found out I should not do a beginner seed. LUL
And yeah, the beginner seed was _way_ too easy. I barely fought things outside of bosses and my characters were starting to hit level 50 when I switched to more async stuff.
you got the upgrade block in sewer that req ultra hammer?
This is a nice touch with the map.
When you say "almost", what's left to be randomized?
I love it! It's so cute. From Minish Cap, yeah?
That old Koot is holding it hostage again. LUL
It's so funny to see Koot talk this fast.
i had a feeling lime was in ch8
yeah you never went back there
Look it up. I'm all for "cheating" when it is only against myself
you can do the 10 hp bowser fight so its fine
i never remember how the 15 hp fight work
oh wait yeah last stand plus damage dodge
NOTED need 15 hp if no last stand
Why were boots up 1, but not hammer? Not that anyone hammers
Time to bust out the calculator
I sometimes skip put once go mode is done because 90% of the time Bowser fights are incredibly similar. This is fun, for me at least
the best part is it doesn't matter you have like 6 repel gels KEKW
Spaghetti w/ meatballs preferably marinara sauce
its going just chilling gonna be lurking
he's been through enough leave him alone
butts been through enough leave him alone
It was on a old show that used to promote games coming out
I'll send the vid in DMs
geese is really being glazed that much now huh
his jump buttons are also like, just good
-4 mids vs ex dp is sick they should balance the game around that
incin became #1 by *far* because its role compression is actually critical to stopping the truly broken mons in the tier
the blowjob brothers are still around
really i was just curious if the blowjob brothers survived
caly-s is broken as hell and most used restricted
i feel like the caly-s speed tie is gonna start a fistfight at an event
kof 98 and vanilla 02 caused fist fights tho
i think every community should be more like the kof community
therefore i wanna see someone get their lights knocked out for winning the hard 50/50
i did have a funny highlight in adv ou today tho
someone crit my charizard after fire blast missed a jirachi
then when the game ended and i needed to get a rock slide flinch
i played around my only way to win!
which was aero flinching and killing jirachi lmao
i only needed one flinch across like 3 rock slide hits
aight now close chat and win
i really hope they start complaining about the hinako athena matchup
cause we both know that shit is just fine for hinako lmao
well they switched off it to an actually bad matchup
ye you always do the slow command throw there
Guess who had to mow his grandma's giant yard again
this goenitz character is really looking like one of the best anchors in the game
what else are you gonna do

You mean its not a hot drop beerdaCelebrate
yo! I found a yoshis island pop tracker and its def helping
hey! how did you learn Rando?
i have clear 3 chapters out of logic
I guess how did you pick it up and begin to learn the run (Pape)
yeah nah I get it lol
ahhhh so you knew all locations and things already
pape was easy for me too cause I watched speedruns for 2 years before rando happened LUL
I’m just one of those who want to learn Rando, but as struggling to learn all of the everything
You can pick up a new rando if it has a logic tracker by just relying on that heavily for your first several runs - that's how I picked up LADX rando and Crystal rando. Don't even worry about speed for a long time
i learn rando from watching people play said rando
I really appreciate the words of advice metalp22LOVE
Wow I caught the start of the seed for once!
so for the wedding I brought my gamecube for mario party so my retrotink is still packed up lol
is it viable to do this on WiiVC?
well I have homebrew WiiU lol
I’d prefer that over emu since I don’t have an everdrive for my 64
next rando i want to play i am gonna use a tracker for the 1st time YEP
perhaps I should seek the discord (I think I’m in it already lmao)
i cant imagine not using a tracker
I have been very capable of not using a tracker for windwaker for years but I refuse to not use one because my frantic ass brain will always second guess myself otherwise lol
i just never use a tracker before
my memory's complete shit so I couldn't run without a tracker lol
ive heard this song all day today
i want to try a seasons ap MW so have to use a tracker never even seen a rando for that game once
I need terraria to update their fucking archipelago
They do stability updates but just dont move it up a version lmao
If someone were to redeem a rando what game is your absolute favorite to run?
is there a way to save your tracker progression with pop tracker?
so before you re roll the MW you wasn't gonna get that power rush was you? KEKW
like its marked out of logic if you dont roll ch 1 or 2
i did beat ch1 scale 7 in that seed at level 1 that power rush would of help phanto274Shrug
I noticed it was different from the rest when I was modifying my layouts
was tabbed out, what'd you find?
oh that remind me i have dolly i never turn in
Why do you hate ravens phantom
i dont hear it either KEKW
oh! I have 23 pieces of Luigi, my goal is 50
did the ff16 crossover event. it functionally ends tomorrow
(it ends on the 8th but there’s maintenance that runs the 6th-8th)
also the dragon quest event is coming back so that’s cool
I just got into this game like a week and a half ago lmao
plus you get rid of cakemix
honestly I’m loving 14 so far lol
but yeah I can say it’s not for everyone lol
ive seen it happen to Adam LUL
does anyone know the timing on that?
walking the dog, ill be back in 20 to ask what I missed lol
Hey Phantom! new here but ive been watching the YT rando stuff for a while now. figured id try and catch a stream!
now way he heals all 5 times
pape and the bosses straight trolling, name a more iconic duo
20 hp, 2 repel, 1 life shroom?
oof the 7 fp mega smash strats
"Singman is definitively better than Adam, who sucks." -Phantom, 2024
I see you didn't grab mega quake
I forgot the bot has the emote
So mega quake was 4 BP, 1 FP
oh, looks like bowser was at the literal exact hp he needed to heal
His rip is nuts but overall I think it's an actually solid release for fuckin once
its been making draft more fun to play aroun
i dont score enough to want them on the field
I only used it because it kept damage consistent and didnt have to worry about defense
My usual bans are Zoroark, Glaceon, Leafeon or Cat
Ye I saw we should play sometime
I've loved that game the few times I played it
Lethal me and proc fiended for a while lmao
Content warning is def way more fun as a fuck around game tho
cause i got my mod folder actually working
o is your lethal actually working now
We had jesse playing last night I woulda pinged you if I knew it worked now lol
I'm pretty dead today cause I had to work a shift alone I wasn't supposed to
But I'm just vibing with bug fables
oh, yeah, getting money back in any way that isnt a company-issued refund = ban for basically any service
We should def play lethal/content warning sometime this week tho glenn if you're free
that works cause tuesday/thursday is when I'd do kof brackets if I stop being lazy and enter them lol
so if you dont get an invite to their server youre shit outta luck?
phanto274Facepalm the tts is part of my webcam layout lmfao
ah yes 1 of the best zelda game ever made
i need boots ch2 stone a tubba key and ch6 items
did you have any luck getting tts sorted?
i can do stuff in ch2 but would like the last stone so i can full clear it with clippy
what are region differences for LTTP?
fake flippers only work on jp
version differences sounds like SNES vs GBA LUL
and you prob item run in this and that jp only
preliminary gl, Imma guess that blue / red mail are not gotten?
so at least pig is not gonna chunk like a truck more then need be
for this, whats defined as a major glitch?
just was curious because I yesterday in rando had a green mail fight v pigman on like 8 hearts cus I refused to h eal up (was boots less no option of tree fairy
okay so the same as majora then LUL
you're allowed to cros world travel? bets not
guess you cant get oob either
wanted to say item dashing via stairs sounds "normal"
cus you have the one at sky cabbage mountain
just 1 unless you back track
lttp never grew on me, I played it once on wiiU and had to look up a guide to finish it. I legit never knew this game had fast travel
@Axl_SR oh yea this game is HUGE on that
and the map is not bad at all to run through unless you're forced only rando dark world is aga no hammer or gloves
marcoGL beestGLGLGL phanto274GL avarie1GL richarGL marcoGL_HF
that item is a poh lol
like - its not my favourite zelda but its up there being close to TMC in regards to polish feels
barring SNES troubles of "too many enemies = lag"
this is my fav zelda game
given rando without much knowledge is in the 3 hours range of a long seed, yea
like - actively double checking maptracker and all
also huuge thanks to the poptracker pape update and sorry again for havin pinged ya about that tippiShy
tldr the current one you could find before would break every couple checks PrideLaugh
like - I heard horror stories and a half from usage
it was hilarious and awful at the same time
pots tippiTap best weapon before master sword
this game was so smart to actively give out 2 lanterns technically
but one of them turns money once you get it, no?
yeah correct link house chest is money now
Lantern can be a 3 time item
gonna assume its because save&quits can be used as glitch setups in some cases or just because running across the world with bonk boots is fun?
man my rando brain is fuuuucked
thanks dedede PrideLaugh throwin out the big ball
I need to memorize that damage setup
bomb jumps are allowed in this that cool
ice palace bomb jump is just toooooo juicy
skull woods big chest bomb jump
imagine if this in vanilla had a bonk counter
"how often did you shake the screen yourself?"
oh right this game just handed out bottles PrideLaugh
"oh yea bottles uhhh... yes here have them all"
yea its rly not... its like what, basically like in rando if you have flute just using it to stock up for pigman? obv. in a run I assume money is gonn be somewhat low after flippers
at least the rubble isnt rng - it being only the head for hitbox do be a bit annoying though
nothing like battling the true trimold
hey at least its not lanmolas on ice
its nearly as fun to have that as it is to have trolldorm on the mothula arena
was wondering why the chu jelly mattered PrideLaugh
also I just saw the split for Aga1 - I love it 🤣
you're not allowed to peg link?
always strategically placed in rooms with lots of drops
no thoughts within this assembly of balls
yo now we can SKIP THE BARRIER SKIP PrideLaugh
elusive double wide grass is too much for lonk to the bonk
I vote no blue balls, nice aga fight on that end tippiTap
I have seen someone who had 17 blueballs in rando before KEKW
no clue how ridiculus tis can spiral
goodness this music never gets old
i never did this buffer before
as someone that doesnt know shit about this game how out of sequence are these dungeons?
technically thieves down and skull woods are 4 / 3 respectively with swamp palace being 2, BUT you can do either of the 3 at the point of having beaten PoD
after thieves town ice palace is open, during your dark world adventures you can grab the flute for mire access
Man another one lost to this game Sadge
You'd have to do hammer jump again
Wait what extra door did you open?
I need to check which doors you used keys on
Sword swings do the same damage as bow
Helmasaur king has 16 hp, MS does 2 per hit
Do you have notes typed up?
I was gonna say, I could probably edit it for you
After you start getting familiar with the run, I can show you a bit more advance stuff
Wait don't be stupid? Damn guess I can't chat here then
Excited to hang out with Glan again this GDQ
There's a heart in top left
Aww yis, another one of the great Zeldas. Gl on the run(s)
oh shit kingdom hearts 2 is on sale on epic store
tried for drops there yesterday during rando and was sad PrideLaugh
the "best" you get is the fairy drops which require Big Key, no?
1 room above the one where you need the block there's a floor below for fairies but as said not sure if you can get there without Big Key
There's an anti fairy before kholdstare that you can respawn twice for fairies
cus if its big key locked, its obviously not an option
that's right of where the block is needed iceblue right?
They can walk north of the falling room before the boss
Lets take a bath here to cleanse our run.
at least it wasn't ice palace where you have to enter with full magic
and getting a game over is bad times
sorry, it's been awhile since I've run this so I'm not going to have any helpful things to say :(
kholdstare does 3 which is the same as most dark world overworld enemies do on green mail to be fair
musta been blankin there then, always thought its 3
maze: Go right->Hold down hold right-> down at 2nd fire stick->hold left until end
this whole dungeon is just UGH
I agree. Ice is hard because of all the tricks and MP management
"hang on I don't think I saw ice rod in that last inventory swap"
guessing you needed to get ice rod before ice palace
maybe during the fake flippers segment?
No ice rod is after Mire
I don't have it in my notes where I get ice rod :P
in fact the whole first half of the game is no notes :O
except eastern palace "Need 3 hearts to do antifairy skip"
Been running this game for years tho
right, which is probably why I don't have notes for the first half for me :P
I TOLD YA NOT TO FORGET
wait yeah that make sense ice since you just flute there get ice rod then flute to death mountain
mfw when strimmer doesn't listen :(
I even scolded you the night I showed you
Like you can technically get it after you get ether
But it's just better to do it after mire
I love this boss so much
You grab silvers and butter before mire right?
Andy hasn't speedrun this game in like years
I think I watched fruitbat's when I learned
Goes to show you how much the route hasn't changed lol
I can go over everything again with you or if you have questions about specific things
I can go over that with you
This is making me wanna come back for a 1:26 lol
i wish i knew that bonk off the pot as a kid i hate doing that room
blacktiger i'll teach you the speedrun
i know tricks ice i play rando
oh man I didn't know you had to refight them
yo showed up right before the end
this is a difficult zelda cus it definitely has that "I am early game, therefore hard" vibes to it
This is not an easy run to learn even with safety
It's one of the reasons that the item in ice palace is blue mail
Mothula sucks because he doesn't take damage if he touches the spikes
If you have butter sword, mothula takes no damage
yeaaah get right back in there
we need a Zelda spinoff game where one of those squirrels pulls the sword
back from tippiEAT popesTreat and nice sub 310
Pot before you go to last section
for PoD wouldnt it be hammer jump, mirror after small key to have the extra?
that moment when a game has different languages available but doesnt install all of them so each lang is a 3gig update c.c
literally makes me want to uninstall rather then play it
Twitch has been denying me my channel points for awhile now
my Switch still has save states from when I was practicing bosses and tricks (that still work on NTSC)
gotta use that commute for something
@janitorbeav I do think that is a thing but the streamer can stall point give outs.
it can literally be twitch thinkin you're not actively watching to deny channel points
its quite dumb at times with those
@stavros12c34anenoglou it was simply me not closing and reopening the Twitch tab. I wouldn't be able to click the reward box and I wouldn't get my timed rewards either
I think on the backend they were making updates and I was running an "old" version of the page/chat
or it was adblocker/script blocker stuff
but I probably should have had 100k months ago lol
well now I'm back in the mines with my 8.
and as I say that I go up to 20
like all i ask is for 15 minutes worth of points and i gotta waste like 45 mins with a streamer.
also btw glad ur doing a runback. Shows commitment.
about 14 of those imes i beat u here
you see blue boomerang is useful YEP
i'll send a screenshot in a min so you can pin it
Look at the shield icon on the wall
There sent you zoomed in screenshots of my visuals
When in doubt, step back and charge sword spins
Best dungeon coming to an end.
Got another big time save on not forgetting ice rod too
Missed the key in that pot in the spike room
This isn't the zelda game I thought you speedran
phanto274Pog someone sent me sushie i have a couple checks
why did nintendo steal the hook shot from the hit game Goof Troop
that room is some sonic the hedgehog bullshit
why does bro keep baby dodongos like dogs
those are wild animals not pets
what if you had to put out all those fires
are those spties being munched in the transition bombs?
thats one thing i love about the zelda series. Shockwaves do matter in real life.
For GT you have to collect all the black star dragon balls scattered across the galaxy
HUH guess i open super block pass blooper but never check anything
doing all this sure is a low worse than just clipping to the credits the first time you visit the castle
are those black mages final fantasy?
double close call on master 2 EZ
nu zelda would give you a heart piece after aganhim
and then ganon would be roaming the ubisoft open world
practice for when you remove this safety
I meant you did everything else with tempered
They spent their entire budget on the 3D model triforce pieces
that's a pretty easy one to remove
is red mail the last you will remove?
and ganon sure does a lot without only green
i have 1 check coming oh yeah
its might be my super boots
damn i was late too lol
awww I missed the popple track
ik grain of salt and all with wiki but still
musta been during the racing game craze of the mid 2000s
when you had stuff likehaha funny oldschool NFS still
I hear that I missed you crushing LTTP yesterday already
hate how empty the JP file select is
all i know is that song is a banger
yes ik that top lvl runs most likely are closer, but this defo seems to make for a somewhat cozy speedgame
memories of me initially not knowing what settings mean in LTTPR into me rolling a green mail 3heart mire
THIS IS HOW I WIN, L
yeah i know i was asking if they practice that lol
a SWORD! is this even rando KappaPride
watching link to the past is making me want to play rando again
still a bit of a brainfuck to my head that you can get stuff like glitchstick (cane of byrna) as your initial weapons in rando
having aga as your only logical dark world access in rando SUUUUCKS
cus you can get sooo far from just there without mirror
that why you play crosskeys KEKW
see - yea that sucks too if flute less
BUT at least that dark world access is near 2 dungeons
and close enough to swamp palace to not be annoying AF
versus if you cant deal with PoD, aga first / only dark world access, you can still go through those 2 dungeons most likely
and its a PAINTRAIN to then walk alll the way over from pyramid to dark kak
yea cape aga1 is a bit of a roughie
not terribly uncommon, but definitely not your average aga1
hmm i only need 5 items to beat my seed well 4 but i am not doing that dumb trick
thought it was something like silverless ganon
i need tubbakey soil water super boots and 1 ch2 stone
fake flippers over to ice palace is ez yea
i was thinking something else lol
bombos afaik also works there logically
can be used to do most of the things afaik
not trinexx cus magic, no torches
nah skull woods backside and trinexx specifically are not doable w fire rod
you can break coldstare ice with 1 bombos
to PoD boss youo cant get without hammer
but ice palace with bombos is fine
though I wouldnt know how to get through the 6 turtles
you can kill him without hammer in boss shuffle but that it
wasnt 100% on whether that room was part of PoD or mire
cus both have a square shape room with stairs roughly in that spot
which is a bit of a pain
i mean bombs can kill most
then buy a couple at kak
the shop at kak has some afaik
also once you have ONE bomb you have infinite technically
because you got a bombs / arrows shack in kak down left corner
yeah kak shop have them unless shop sanity
the standalone guarantees a weapon on uncle
be it cane of byrna, hammer, whatever else it chooses
bombs are a logical weapon i believe
just that with bombs, you need to grind for them a bit
the shack at kack has 4 bombs 4 arrow drops once you have that one - I just cant think of a guaranteed bomb drop
hey - MMOoTR has had thoughts out there for stick logic from rolling into trees of all things
so - I get ya, but if people want that craze
and LTTPR is so small of an overworld where I think they just went with it
you do usually get a real weapon early tho
lemme quickly look at the base rando website, before I start diggin into the apworld of LTTP PrideLaugh
@blacktiger51 its REALLY not that early in multiworld
you can literally spend MOST of the game without a weapon and then be forced into a late boss rush
wait, are you playing on your SNES?
maybe 1 day n64 will let you play on console for ap
so for reference as to what the weapons on uncle standalone are allowed to be
1) sword, 2) hammer, 3) bow + full ammo, 4) 10 bombs, 5) fire rod + full magic, 6) cane of somaria + full magic, 7) cane of byrna + full magic
which ARGUABLY the only ones I'd personally see as no grind ones are hammer and sword, cus anything magic related is based on magic drops which are rare in the overworld
yea I get what they are talking about
and that then sucks like something went weird there / is weird in the AP implement of it
so I wasn't the only person with that issue, nice, i guess ?? ?
I renember from like a year or more ago hearing friends talk about that as potential issue
though they can unstick themselves pretty well with cross map traversal and shit
meaning they can force OoL ways into getting bombs
first action with bombs before hhyrule castle as recommend / workaround given however long an update can take there though: in Kakariko, the far southwest corner has a little shack
which you need 1 bomb to open
and inside you get bombs on repeat from pot drops
maybe just force that shack open for ap
@blacktiger51 that doesnt fix the issue
because then you are implementing a forced run to kak before anything fighting
yeah since you can play other settings
I'd rather then say for the starting weapon on uncle to be a world local item
like - imo you just need to force the first weapon logical to a LTTP seed in AP to be world local
like how you can force certain items to be world local
and the only real "convenience" work arounds rn are either starting yourself with lv1 sword or 10 bombs
which the 2nd variant I mentioned still holds that issue of forced run to kak implement
so yea - tldr, weaponless LTTPR is sucky
and last I renember you cant really force a bomb drop from enemies
other useful info for LTTPR: stun prizes from enemies
not always available just as a "yea this can be useful"
then like blacktiger mentioned pull trees
i did make a yaml for it for crosskeys bomb bag shuffle maybe that wasn't a good idea  KEKWait
cus its also shuffled but static
and then the last I could think of there is rly just "50 bucks from farming money into buying bombs in a shop"
there a set up for that? i didn't know
because bombs afaik are suuuper common in shop pools outside of shop shuffle / retro style shops
@blacktiger51 I didnt know either but am not surprised - the game's been out for 30+ years
i don't watch speedruns of this KEKW rando players just do it guess that why
guess why they "just do it" in rando - its because you're not on a clock to get to the finish with uncertainty to where items are
so you have instances where you need to go ice rod cave
yeah messing up a trick in rando doesn't matter too much
nope no hearts here, ToH is relatively health starved
might get lucky on trolldorm drops
I am part of a raid now
solder in the bushes, taking a nap until twink runs him over
.... why tf do soldiers spawn in the bushes
@buff00n hey thats better then random buried bombs
can i request more subspace with mvd soon monadoLove
he could knock out 40 then go about the rest of his month
as a ALttP stan, I understand and accept the slander and allegations
it definitely shows that hit detection has learned since SNES days
i sent you 10 bombs, use them wisely LUL
so use one in kak on shack
just so you have inifinite free bombs available
@jonxhas thats what you'd hope but unfortunately not really
hitbox will forever be a curse for gamers
@TheMasterZelda oh I am not sayin it wont
you forgot the "AH AH AH AH" when counting
count count was out for breakfast KEKW
My Yoshi is so baked rn
yea honestly that sounds like the type of RNG I'd not wish to roll for
his right leg is bigger than his left leg
if only the lanmolas before would not have been a tell of rng PrideLaugh
designer’s first use of the snes’ number seeding
the WORST bit imo about mothula is the spike surroundings and moving floor
like - mothula while not on an escalator would be fine
Kholdstare on a platform like trolldorms is also quite... an experience KEKW
randomizer + boss shuffle be like
whats funny is trolldorm on the escalator floor
I just realized the dsiware version of 4 swords probably doesn’t have the cross save stuff
bc it gets affected by it, and you can just spinslash it freely
LTTP boss shuffle is not crash prone imma tell ya that
and there are decent safeguards in place so as not to get stuck
BUT the world palettes can get rather weird with it depending on the combo of boss to room
or whatever this well thing is called
Imma guess that silverless is just straight up slower then getting them?
just something which you dont yet want to deal with :D
which is 100% fair as silverless pig is rough to get into
shut i go any time i got on this stream somthing bad happens
as for the best description I could give for silverless timing: the frame he starts teleporting is when your spin needs to connect
not that it would make it any less annoying bc you also need torch glitch then and if you cant reliably hit the timing its just a magic sink
i got to say i hate turtle rock
wait! I thought lynels were only in BotW?
lynels existed in Zelda 1 / possibly 2 afaik
in zelda one they come in red and blue variants throwing daggers around
but they basically have been non existent since this til BotW revitalized them
does blue mail override red mail?
yeaaa naaah rough call on learning to skip
I think you could downgrade in this, but unsure
with shields they made sure that you cant lose mirror shield if you were to pick it up
nah you can not lose it
but I am unsure if blue mail could be picked up in post to override red mail
given this is a game from the times where stuff like that was common to happen; i reckon you could?
I am turning berries as checks off for next time lol
at least its not dex shuffle
I don't mind it but it feels like there are so many things to check for a multiworld that I get access to early
Yeah trainers I would not be having fun lol
I did that to myself one time, no junk all checks rly
trainers are COZY compared to searching for your 1% encounter w/o sweet scent
like - just up to brawly its 200 checks in trainers + encountersALONE
and any further thing you get gets you more
before magma emblem stuff I had like 800+ checks out of 1338 checks done
or rather: there are ways around it, but that also means you then just get early mach bike instead
and you get spoon fed going meteor falls and to fortree and such via that
when i try red and blue i am gonna do trainers
@blacktiger51 curious if you need to talk to the trainers for the money check or not
and then from mt chimney to wattson
then you go aaaaall the way back
and if then slateport gives you items for the other side again without devon goods
you then do that WHOLE roundabout again
cus admittedly if the roundabout path is surf-less and you then get surf, its arguably convenience
I'm convinced my rock smash is off world but who knows at this point
@Amishman19 !hint knows if you wanted to know KEKW
but thats a "if you want to"
I should hint feather badge tbh
yesterday I was in a small multi w frens who had KH1, Hat in Time while I was KH2 hitlist
and when I started getting to soft BK, I hinted something which was locked by something which was locked by something was locked by something
it was a whooole ass chain KEKW
I sent superr smash and mega smash to marioman LUL
Wish N64 everdrive could do that
thats fair - not to mention playing input lag-les
HOLD you gonna try dkc 3 rando?
why does it not work on N64?
I dont think it was ever tried much though
ALSO if you ever do LTTPR phantom
do NOT let people have !collect as command
and on emu, LTTPR at times can bork up the connection permanent like from !collect being done
sure it would be nice but how many archipelago games are N64?
SNI is just a server name interface
DK64 current biggest hurdle is needing bizhawk on a specific version for it to even run
and for gameboy games you have LADX
cant you run GB on snes everdrive?
yea I was thinkin super gameboy for that
cus then you could hook it in via SNI, done tippiThink
aka "let ppl cook with gamecube games first"
cus that'd carry over to GBA
OR you do gba via Wii u
the N64 feels like the most troublesome too though
because of how SUPERBLY fucked the N64s hardware is PrideLaugh
cant they port over what snes has?
the biggest problem I could see is if ANY of the randos on AP are not done well in regards to N64 stuff
bc the N64 is a conundrum and a half on that end
what works on 1 emu + graphics plugin dont work on the same emu diff graphics plugin and all that shit
i feel like there isnt enough N64 stuff there for someone to consider it
it has to be related to the shenaniganry of "we like WiiVC fuck N64"
also SNES games afaik died a bit quicker to N64 games?
that being said: 100% game preservation should not stand as a topic of discussion for speedruns imo
Yoshi's Story runs do wiiVC cause it controls like ass on N64 and wii patched it
if you drop a chu oob it will crush for oot unless u on wii
what other DECENT games exist on N64
opens drawer and sees F Zero X LUL
like - DK64 I think now is wii u? could be wrong?
i remember seeing majora's on wiiu and apparently it was garrrrrbage lol
@RvPA wii u gives you lots of input lag
but it was like, the only one that could access and use the debug menu or something?
you got the N64 mario party and sports games KEKW
the pokemon games, speedrun wise puzzle comes to mind first
sports games Weirdge I'd rather play another open world slop then those personally >.>
so switch games have that too like mario kart and astal chain
didnt risch make bn auto splitters too?
it has crossed my mind to get a snes everdrive but the snes library doesnt grab me enough to spend that much
how many GBA games have AP support?
yeah wario land has a ton of items to collect, at least land 3 did
kingdom hearts chain of memories lol
there's so many random unsupported games now LUL
I think part of the issue with randovania is the closed bits of it
no AP but there is a castlevania and bomberman combo rando on GBA like what lttp and super metroid does
funny thing: MM has been asked about for AP for a bit
but didnt happen cus of licensing
and so far no one went and did the thing from scratch
@Jonxhas we getting combo for ap soon and you can gen mm only side now
I thought they moved passed that
the way for it to happen is a) OG devs of the rando say "okay fine you go and recode it"
Pape rando would have to change its license to be allowed on the site
and then b) someone doing that
and they cant just change the liccense?
GPL can include MIT, MIT cannot include GPL
and when it comes to MM specifically, it was also a case of coding language choice being sub optimal even if you were to allow it
meaning it would need a recode entirely
Maybe I'm confused on what you're saying
Okay yeah, I think you said it backwards the first time
I've heard it said that GPL makes sense for some things but that game mods are not one such thing
Yeah, and that's the reason GPL exists in the first place
Oh no my featherbadge is in victory road in my game NotLikeThis
thats why one enables "fly without badge"
@Amishman19 umm is that for fly?
It's my first time, had to screw around a little bit lol
its like having song of soaring in / behind moon lock
aka when you mostly are done with MM anyway
like - yes there have been cases you can search for where there is a dual license type thing going on
but its also a MAASSIVE hassle to work that out in the first place I reckon
and as said: with MM, it basically boiled down to "hey, uhhh we cant just support it cus licensing period" into "well we COULD if the OG dev is fine to let someone recode it entirely under diff license in a diff code base"
cus AP is python mostly while MM (example case) is C#
thats just straight fucked up imo
like... thats like saying someone working in storage cant work at diff storage cuzs they made box piles from left to right rather right to left to my brain
and YES that is very oversimplified terms
"sign here to only be a workhorse for microsoft and for no one else ever" comes to mind there
which ik you had mentioned at some point
you say that KEKW but they are currently being flung at every piece of social media / related
"we are microsoft, we love buying and then abandoning shit"
its like "we are sony, we love helping people bring shit onto our platform but only under OUR terms" w helldivers 2
oh evil within 3 is not happening now Sadge
@blacktiger51 or if it ever does, then YEARS down the line
aka the next low of Resident evil truly
literally doing ubislop narratives with that they are
"people have to get comfortable not owning their games" my ass
gamepass / similar imo are the biggest poison you could have to videogames as a whole
oh yeah i can change my color back
cus it will quite literally change the leverage consumers have on that end by A SHIT TON
gamepass and psn extra is shit
same applies to the NSO+ stuff
NVidias variant whatever name it goes by, the google stadia attempt
all of that is a hot mess
I would not mind it AS much IF there'd be - you know - a "PURCHASE" option
well I bet it was also mostly for AAA / related, no?
so at least no discrimination based on size of company then
is this your fav zelda game?
anyhoo: all that subscription BS needs no be done and away with imo cus it is the literal fuel for ubislops argument
and while in the uk you had a recent thing go through stating games should be preservable - its a whole bag of shit if none of the games are available for purchase, just as subscription
well getting to ch7 with super boots is pretty easy
I can currently not judge that I got my headphones at max
yo you can hold 5 more arrows in the mw phanto274Smile
found out the other day dk64 rando has bn tracks. They were fight K Rool and surge of power was playing. Cant think of a more fitting song LUL
(yes I didnt comma where I shoulda, sorry)
surge of power is the song that play in battle network 6 whenever you fight a boss navi
I never played much if any megaman game
also I THINK you can adjust LTTP via adjuster with whats available working with that yea
yup using msu packs for the smz3 seed rn lol
you can also for LTTP as is afaik
its this zelda + Super Metroid as combo rando
lets go!! I can hold 4 eggs now
i am actually so bad at mashing power shock
because in levels where you have access to inifinite eggs, you then need to use the single one to farm star points
in my smw rando i never got cape or spin jump phanto274Cry
spin jump is sad, cape is eh arguably
yes, it makes running through levels for just goal tapes easy
like - spin jump is SO good for defensive manouvers
cape not near as much if you get yoshi though, no?
I assume you saw the image of my tracker I shared in your discord? Everything on the right side was progression like beanstalk, morphing veciles, melons, to hold keys, ect.
unless you get specifically the "fly under butter bridge secret exit" being required?
i just rush go mode to send the rest of my items smw rando was cool but its sucks
overall yes - not arguing that
jus thinking that a LOT of the strength of cape boils down to flying over the level
whereas you CAN cheese a LOT of cape related things via yoshi
i cheese needed to climb with yoshi
imma assume its because you had levels needing cape specifically
like say butter bridge the one I mentioned or not all switches but having to do that star road level
but yea there's a lot of niche OoL things you can do with yoshi
which you just wouldnt NEED to do with cape
so no healing in the fairy holes here KEKW
that being said its EP aka "unless ball room is annoying, free rush through" dungeon
i remembered how to sushie glitch in ch7
funny how the bot @ orange just to say "Im not talking to you " LUL
what even is I spy fantasy
holy shit my jade raven in here very late in logic
but I dont like sports games KEKW
okay you know - thats not sports... PrideLaugh
snoopy tennis was, ff tactics isnt
as much as I am not into FF much
like - yea I like KH (not as much anymore having seen what Squeenix did) but for Final fantasy I never rly played it much and when I first rly saw it it felt like a whole lot of "look, crystals, bad guy, GOOOOOO"
that screenshot is hilarious to me, ngl
seeing the trackers, it does look close - seeing the game screens not quite so PrideLaugh
Phantom, you were on Bowser??? and Jcog was on Final KEKW
so it was TECHNICALLY 2 bowser fights on screen
just one of them had a couple ? to it
looking at my collection of bot quotes and with speed marioman rolled pape all bosses KEKW
also that HAS to be a meme cat
Any of the mario cartridges Kappa
if I had an N64... PrideLaugh
nah if its like that amish, then its every mario game
its like "how quickly can you die in all zelda games" PrideLaugh
I have never played it KEKW
I mean.... not as a main... no PrideLaugh
also I am 100% memes rn with the command anyway
I played the PS1 remake as a kid
probably if I were to, I'd try myself o n something like any% the end is nigh or some shit like that
i have a physical switch copy of end is nigh
@Axl_SR Pog I only have pc version
but it came with a manual
a game with box and a manual
i have like 4 switch games with manuals
did the manual come with pictures and everything like the oldschool booklets?
Yo my seed had all 3 power plus
wait I just realized all I lhave left is the stuff lwest of Pacifidlog and I don't have fly FLASHBANG
pretty sure no mega rush or last stand tho
did you set your emerald up with self sending items
save BEFORE you do anything left of pacidiflog
then do it methodically and just reload
I don't have waterfall or the 8th badge pepeW
I think I do, I'll savestate then
IF its something you need to get for yourself AND your seed is not setup to self send items
i beat master 3 then reset to keep my items
because emerald you can set up in such a way that all items get looped
HIGHLY recommend doing that as it will make benny hills fly less SO much less of a pain
I'm setting fly always on next time for sure
if only the beam would do good damage though SadgeCry
like its preferable over getting hit for sure
cus none is gold but rare
if you get double digit blueballs you're either MAD about it or gigglin your arse off
and then miss cus of giggles
time to fight crystal king with a 1 fp fire shell YEP
(which the latter one is how the 17 blue ball happened which I saw someone experience as they went into a MASSIVE giggle fit over blueballs being higher then 5 even)
and it went into jokes about how blueballing someone that much can not be healthy
does dizzy shell work on him?
shit i cant mash it KEKW
also i miss click and use lullaby and he took a nap KEKW
gotta lobe that this game technically knows quarter hearts but never shows them
Oh look, found rock smash and Phantom's fire rod YEPSPIN
if you got hammer, gloves? yea fire rod is IP and SW
plus if you got access to TR and somaria + ice rod, you can do that then as well
could get ya through Mire though
or did mire also need hammer?
super starved LTTPR world sounds like
ok he spit into 3 he have 3 hp left if i miss i lose a life shroom
idc i can just buy life shrooms for 35 coins and i am rich
ch7 is full clear beside snowman gift
@Axl_SR be careful you can get sick that way
yes in time for best portion
of course there a fucking  chomp in the battle i needed to get clippy
moth was less of a dick LETSGO
oh nice you got your book
marioman gave me space jump and i've been full clearing SM lol
i wanted to check ruin key 4 but all the fights i needed clippy off said no Madge
ok in bk mode phanto274Bless for a tubba key outside his castle
need tubba key 1 ch2 stone and water
then i am in go mode
i'm not in bk but i'm tired of playing tonight lol
ay this link is my discord prof pic
that movement just blew my mind
okay, im done for today. ive crossed over 100 checks and I have 41/50 to reach my goal
been doing AP stuff off stream
I didn't realize how much was similar between the two games theme wise
yesterday I messed up my sleep schedule, went to bed at 8pm and woke up at 5:30 AM LUL
I found a few pape things today like a ruins key and triangle stone lol
find my arrow wheel and super star KEKW
Have access to Turtle Rock yet? phanto274Smile
MarioManTAW: Have access to Turtle Rock yet? phanto274Smile
We love waiting simulator everytime you reconnect to an async
I did a double take! I thought that was my super star LMFAO
when you knocked that star down you broke it and ggave a piece of it to tiger LUL
Oh that's not the Pape bucket lol
you throw an egg at a hanging bucket you can ride it like a boat across water
That helps me with Prince Froggy's Fort, the boss where the frog eats you and your throw eggs at its uvila
oh nice, thatll open the Lansat flower gate Kappa
ice breaker is what its called
something with a pixel line up and somaria
red cane is not the best name for a game with 2 red related rods tippiGiggle
drop to kholdstare is hammer blocked
and skull woods loooves to do it
so south of witch with the mitts then back up
I think you can also do the fake flippers then get a warp to be up there
fairy fountain is before zoras domain
right before this section far left corner
for the ledge HP you gotta drop down south of king zora then left on the midway level
the rare occurence of me having played too much rando where its helpful :D
hammer locked fort PoD, IP, hammer/hook locked for TR, flute locked for MM
there are glitches so you do have some stuff but phanto274Shrug
then whatever medallion you need to enter TR
if glitches the seed is easily not existent though as you could just go death mountain then into Ganons
did you know about thhe iron boots hitbox?
marcoGL avarie1GL phanto274GL richarGL beestGLGLGL marcoGL_HF
what was the tweet in shitposting? Its been taken down
and that why 90% of games now sucks ass
so if they wanted to keep there jobs they had to delay hi-fi rush by 2 years?
shut down by making a pitch lmao
Yo! Was just watching a Paper Mario rando video on YT and came in! Love the stuff
wow... "During a town hall with ZeniMax staff on Wednesday morning, Xbox president Matt Booty praised Hi-Fi Rush but did not specify why the company had shut down the development studio behind it"
did you make any progress on rando last night?
With QVC you can get TTYD for 40 bucks
Id rather have a physical copy
when I got pikmin1+2 from them my shipping was only 5 bucks
i rather not go out to get a physical copy
my rage 😤 went up 🆙 to
there is only 4 games in history where I truly 💗 the first boss and stage Mario wonder 💭 being 1️⃣
There is an ice cream truck outside KEKW
who drives an ice cream truck at 8:30?
the lonk to the bonk is going I see
lanmolas is just a bit of an annoying boss - if it feels mor reliable, spins over slashes if bow low?
thats the only thing I could think of for those 3 worms
that is what I thought, arrows being on MS spins I bet
ahhh yea then nvm my thought
that is where my brain is coming from yea
Microsoft says it needs games like Hi-Fi Rush the day after killing its studio. “We need smaller games that give us prestige and awards,” Matt Booty told employees in a town hall today. And im sitting in my own corner of the internet wondering, Why would Jim Ryan say this?  Cheer100
Best Girl is here to stay.
all of that fight somewhat depends on where specifically you get the head into which direction it takes, no?
cus it can decide its angle from that poin?
if you dont get fireballd out of your position, I guess
yea then not much of a clue - my guess there is just that the speed in which you need to connect the hits is all that goes w that bit cus I obv. am not talkin from a speedrun but rather rando experience
and there I can see him always go at least to the bottom given not having guaranteed health nets in fairies
i wonder in the world record if they skip that fight
bomb jump maybe, but you'd need a key
like - you could bomb jump that dodgy like but you cant cus you need the key from moldorm
unless you could have a better key, no skippin trolldorm 2
and given the game is as old as it is, BETS people would have found a better key by this point
you have to do a really dumb trick
I dont even think its rly new
its just something super dumb to do
you know the frame walk on non existent floors?
its a from looks frame perfect mash between walk to boots to walk to boots
so you dont drop a floor
which you could theoretically do at any place where there is non floor tiles
though it looks like its that type of improvement you really only need to worry about on high level runs
yea so for reference: you see it being done in the top spots on the speedrun leaderboard, but just a couple minutes off of that, you see ppl just fight moldorm
so trolldorm 2 skip via hovering really isnt worth that much given how precise of a trick it is
ItsGoTime with the perfect top 6 zelda
for the tracker stuff I did it on my end last night, last time I sent a PR for the maps it was still missing some stuff that you still had to do. Plus I doubt you care about legendary hunt stuff anyways so I did it all locally.
I added the items and made a deoxys counter from zero to 12
for sure, and I have no interest in trainersanity and if I did Id just use the pop tracker for that
Emerald has way to many open options to beat it. Crystal u enjoy the journey of the hunt
just thought id remind you about ordon sword check, i dont remember if you got it or not
how helpful is can of somaria?
i just need 1 ch2 stone
I just logged in and triggered credits as soon as I entered a level LUL
Your sheduling has been fire so all good
if I was doing baby bowser Amish would have my go mode, needing giant eggs to throw at baby bowser. But thats locked behind his rock smash which he is lacking the HM and badge LUL
is there a way to reach that chest with just clawshot?
its okay for peeking far away checks at least
I spoke to Pronyo about the tracker stuff and they said im basically ready to code a randomizer now LUL
tippiLurk gl with the seeds, hope good plants grow from'em
hope you're well, my brains proper fried from tired
but I am not quite a tire
this seed be lookin good so far or bunch of weird?
sword lets you fight argorak LUL
@Axl_SR but can one just zhover up there? KappaPride oh wait, its twilight princess
also I bet a zombie hover in that room would be deadnasty
first time I did this check it took me forever to find it on the tracker LUL
both the pre circle double clawshot one and the one itself
@Axl_SR reason is cus the item is received up here?
also I think another reason was cus making a double locale mapped item is rough
like - I know they exist from LTTPR maps where its mapped twice, but its then a single item
for your map trackers how do you know where to place the map coordinates? Like the X and Y zones in the json?
I'd just fuck around find out KEKW
I make ONE McDeez joke, and IMMEDIATELY get fed a mcDeez ad
Fave weaponry was laying around KEKW
LITERALLY WASNT EVEN AN HOUR AGO TOO
short refresh time cus it obviously added delay to formerly good delay
also I think another dumb issue with multi locale items outside of how crowded lake hylia is was there being the thought of poe shuffle the one spot where the poe is right near where you'd get dropped from the cutscene minigame
to the tracker bit again axl - and it being somewhat weird to try and add a multi locale item to those
unknown eta which is fair yea
I cant put stress on anyone with those things
hell - it would be SUPER unfair to do that to custom applet projects anyway given fuckin triple A is basically early access day 1 patch memes
do we know what to expect from 3.0
we know what comes when it comes
its definitely better then being stuck in Silksong hell
where we know its been a thought for FOREVER but then ideas happened, unity happened, shit like that
maybe itll get dolphin support KEKW
which by this point, I wouldnt be surprised of ppl being shitlords once it DOES come out about it
cus like - KH3 (outside of the epic games tie in bullshite) overall is a good game but a) was announced WAYS too early, and b) from there was waaay too anticipated to be received well
what does talking to goron do?
as much as it overall was a decent game
in rando you dont need to
ive never done that in rando and was able to do the mini game
you just pay off then its doable
maaaybe? I rly only can see value in that if its your shadow crystal though
cus otherwise, you'd chase your sphere zeros pretty aggressively anyway
whats the circumstances where it'd make sense to go there - having a wolf set up at south hyrule maybe?
or other checks at south hyrule
a few weeks ago I was playing TP HD and I hate that quick transfrom is mapped to gamepad only
cus for letter quest, somewhat of a toughie
cus you still have to back and forth for scent
@Axl_SR hey it could be worse - it could be like WWHD which overall has a super nice feature in the aiming reticle on the cannon
but for some godforsaken reason it adds HEAPS of lag to have that
(among me also disliking some of the QoL changes personally in WWHD, like how most of the triforce charts were turned into straight up being the triforce pieces instead
magic armor could let you get underwater chests LUL
nice to see our first dungeon will be my fave
I need to renember that magnetism on ball&chain for that
but haha lmao ez OoL check grabs
making the best item after spinner even better imo
like - as much as double clawshot is cool, its super restricted by usecase
in temple of time there I had lantern there, if I knew I could use ball and chain it would saved me back tracking
clawshot before mines is nice for that one dumb chest, plus its quick entrance to the boss room
tryin to think: that ball and chain item grab works on any item or only on the bug ones?
@Jonxhas I have a TP clip that makes me laugh everytime I watch it LUL
I saw you try to do so, yea
phantom did you see the mm pc port felihePrideSit
which that to me sounds like any freestanding item really then
MM PC port...? is decomp finished for that now?
theres gonna be 2 mm pc ports when decomp is done lol
@Feli_Heli I wouldnt necessarily bank on that
oh there was a video explaining that process but I havent watched it yet
no ship mm is already a thing
they are just waiting for decomp to be done
either way its definitely a "huh interesting" for me more then anything
is it magic armor time Kappa
cus like.... as impressing as it is like... I dunno
like - kudos to ppl being able to do it
see you SAY that, but then shit like SM64 pc port stuff exists KEKW
so this pc port is really really good
i was messing with it last night felihePrideSit
also hess can still crash the game lol
also blacktiger51 why surprised about hess crash existing in US MM KEKW
that's been a thing for FOREVER KEKW
thinking that the pc version could fix it maybe 1 day tho
you can hess crash in every version of mm
they def could, rando fixed it
yea but US version is easier to afaik cus its tighter timings
and in rando for MM specifically, there's now an option "safer glitches" which fixes a BUNCH of shit
be it rando introduces shenanigans or vanilla glitch crashes (meaning hess crash, weirdshot crash, shit like that)
but its not a forced "its there"
rando still gives you the option to crash for a meme if you want
and? I dont see a single program unable to crash
you just have to know how 🙃
weirdshot only crash on English but yeah rando fix that
you can crash from weirdshots on jp if you know how Kappa
@blacktiger51 it also can crash in the JP version, its just more prone to happen in US cus 1 less frame to activate weirdshots
plus area dependend additional jank stuff from OoB and such
that chest was basically a trap lol
i have never seen a speed runner crash from it so guess i didn't know
its much harder to crash on jp
@blacktiger51 trevperson during his prac for I think it was 100% had a couple instances
you pretty much have to be right up against a wall for it to crash on jp
cus 100% glitched, not NMG / buglimit
which is pretty easy to avoid
ahh only seen pope morp and ennopp run the game
aaand now I borked the miniplayer
ya know whats worse then getting this ad rn? the fact that I HATE HATE HATE HAAAAATE german announcers in ads
and ye ik that button exists KEKW
i only hate Adge when i get a food Adge and i am hungry KEKW
like - the ONLY couple adge moments I get are "oh hey did you know about this getscammed24 website which does all your thinkin for you?" and now there's mcDeez added in on it
i always waste so much time looking for the checks in this field
I just dont like adge as much as I to some extent get why it exists
i just never remember the exact location
like - a) most of the products are not really interesting to me, b) they ALL are the exact same slog with NO feeling like whoever did the ad actually cared about the product
i will say that it feels good to go back to wiivc mm and actually be able to pause buffer
and the couple times where I see someone care, its usually not just an ad randomly poppin up cus the internet decided to show it
at least u have room for ur ruppee grabs
@Feli_Heli hear me out: MMR has a pause buffer code which you can have as part of some QoL setting
I forget if its tied to safer glitches or something else
but basically its "hold start to pause buffer"
we need a pc version of combo rando so i can play no logic and pause buffer tricks
i think the oot pc port has that too
i didnt know mmr had that
there's also "hold A for mash text"
i havent been doing rando very much recently
I only really know cus I was lucky to play seeds with others playtesting 1.16 when it still was alpha
phantom have you done an mm rando before
and some of the features then got introduced
MM I'd be happy to help ya from a pure rando side
ive played mm one time on 3DS... I dont want to go back to that version
i never played mmr before but i play combo so i know mm rando KEKW
like - the one thing MMR has as a bit of an issue map tracker wise is that given how overworld funcs, for max shuffle there's not really a "non crowded" maptracker for it if that makes sense
@blacktiger51 you say that, but last memories of mine to that sounded diff KEKW
plus MM handles itself slightly differently in the combo rando implementation compared to MMR standalone logic wise
I have it on my wii too, but if I played casually id wanna do redux on everdrive
i think i have 6 versions of mm rn
i know mmr cuz i use to watch ennopp play it jon
I was gonna guess ique was one version Kappa
@blacktiger51 thats like hearing someone say "I know OoTR cus I watch ZFG" KEKW
not saying you dont know it
i remember when zfg wasnt a rando streamer
just - that does NOT really give me feels KEKW
zfg been playing combo only mm for the settings
to be fair on them: grinding 1 game for years on years on years does get old at SOME point
at least zfg is playing the good n64 zelda game now
@Feli_Heli Kappa but its not DK64 wdym
whenever i play oot i just want it to be mm
yea I did see that too
and I saw the imminent learning of child DC
tbh if i did glitchless amq for oot i would probably just get slingshot
doing dc without slingshot sucks ass
dont you love losing your nyooom cus of glitchless jumps around fire rings?
i dont think it really saves that much time to not get it
i mean idk how much time but lol
afaik jcog did the beginner route of OoT amq
he did the corner jumps around the fires towards bomb bag
and I'd guess he didnt go for the WR route
interesting - could be an equip thing then? I dunno
have you ever seen "glitchless" any%
last time i did dc without slingshot was in our last MW and almost rage quit lol
all agitha turn ins are junked
i actually did a run of that
hey - glitches are only glitches if they feel like glitches KappaPride
we cant just play the game nintended
anyhow - I think imma become tire now, try for snooze HahaSleep
@Jonxhas tbh the tricks in oot glitchless any% kinda feel like glitches lmfao
@Feli_Heli I wont discuss that KEKW
the definition of "glitch or not" is so fuckin stupid at times depending on community and their perceived objectiveness to what is / is not a glitch
cus like - THEORETICALLY in bethesda games with companions (so skyrim, fallout 4 as examples, no clue if their space skyrim has it still ornot) it s "not a glitch" that NPC's just pick shit up past their weight limit
then again you DID see effort coming from bethesdumb towards it being not easy
oh that sounds like shadow temple early KEKW
i think it is oob but i think they just allow oob in any%
if you can get oob without glitches
there is an in unverse explanation for that here. the fairies give u an extendo pouch.
its not quite OoB as you are still ON the map KappaPride
"Out of Bounds is OUTSIDE the boundaries of where you can move like normal" KappaPride
aka "not on game map" aka "falling to abyss"
no way could that mean just standing on the rim of a box map 🤣
u were supposed to go out of bounds via shadow medallion and spirit medallion powers.
mm has a weird definition of oob
Fierce diety mask proportion did allow oobs along with stone and giant properties
a damage boost is a glich but bomb hover not???
you dont want my delirious brain ramble further in this discussion, I'd have WORDS KEKW
@Rag3torock its bc a clip happened from it
think say you have an icicle somewhere or an ice block
and cus of a damage boost, you get into the collision of it
such be the discussion of whether something is / is not a glitch
and your only true roundabout is "what did devs intend"
and by THAT definition a WHOLE lot of other things people do would not be allowed
cus that could mean as silly as speedy spins in pape
cus I BET nintendo didnt imagine people just spin jumping everywhere
in mm, if you do a glitch by accident, the mods will still verify the run lol, just adding time that was saved to final time
or if it doesnt save time they dont really care
if an accidental glitch does not cause a significant timesave, its fine
but you can do oob without using glitches and its ok phanto274Facepalm
and if its a VERY miniscule one, make a clause for top 100 times
it would then still be shit
had sxhe redo the trick after the clip?
oot mods really do be going frame by frame
yea that just sounds like anarchy
i guess oot has more history of cheaters than mm lol
anyway thats why oot is bad Kappa
@Feli_Heli reminds me about how I heard from someone that learning quick kills for bosses for OoTR is a no go and cheating
I lost my shit about that KEKW
also I said I wanted to sleep
and I aint following that KEKW
can you do somthing with the sling shot
kitty have boots i call it
oh no not the spring water i hate it
spring water is the only bad part of this game
i should really turn that off in my settings lol
where do you get 2nd and 3rd bomb bag in vanilla?
@Axl_SR aqua goron and zora game
actually you just need to unblock the river to get the bag, not do the game
but the game gives you big bomb bags
did you know you can tennis with these enemies with your sword?
i thought you were ggonna sink with magic armor KEKW
nex 2 chjest only arrows XD
you still have fishing rod equipped lol
i missed the cat walking the pupper
@Feli_Heli do you have a setup for the owl statue where you drop from above and land on it?
that one is trash and I hate it
on my rando i needet lantern to it was in a bug inside the lantern cave
completli blind first time in this cave
do you dont need the secon hook shot
you need 2 fused shadows too Kappa
im curious on how many spheres this is
you have a few checks befor you nee it
gotcha, I thought it was this grotto
no lantern was in the magig stuff chest
oh so its hard required then
i go to sleep lurk on phone gn all
I have seen someone throw the statues on the switches in here
so you get master sword and run to arbiters?
so its a hacked save then? Kinda like the skip opening cutscene in mario sunshien category?
I'm making a new version of the glitchless spreadsheet, did you still want a column on the sheet?
yo tiger ty for the gl
you better not turn on me and start running diveman% Kappa
okay cool i'll just leave it as is then
Yo lopez ty for the gl
would be cool to see a new 3:45 on there one day
yeah it's a big commitment lol
Exactly 20 years ago today, Nintendo presented their legendary E3 2004 press conference. Reggie made his debut, the DS was revealed and Mr. Miyamoto leapt onto stage with a sword and shield to unveil The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It was an epic event! I love dumb trivia stuff like this. Cheer100
but reggie quote tweeted it so it must be true
I miss 2000s E3, I dont miss modern E3
that reveal for kid Icarus reveal "Sorry to keep you waiting" gets me everytime
somebody speedran mario 64 at the paris games week, its on the "thank you for playing my game" so now no one else can play it anymore KEKW
bot I will dismantle you code by code
in b4 it's at the castle 😏
its fine probably just a little warm Kappa
ok but how long has it been there for you gotta ask
Why are we milkin Hylians?! Is this the war crimes they did here?
the only milk i would buy from are the zoran markets
Ya, I thought that used Text Displacement?
There is also the strat to recoil back with Iron Boots
Glithless runners do it. The fire boosts you in front of the ladder.
looking over the switch leaks, why is not one talking about notches!?!
I went out and bought a cheap usb gamecube style controller just for pape multi world, and ttyd HD
sadly I cant use gamecube controller for TTYD HD cause yoshi stampede used ZL and ZR
i must go tend to my little cub now ill ttyl <3
it could still be on Talo LMAO
I always see people spin attacking this fight and it usually never works lol
youre still gonna do Talo, right? RIGH T!?!?
I want my points back then
I stayed for go mode, gonna dip out. GGs on the seed
lol at the 1 bomb killing all the bokoblins
Is this your fav Final Dungeon?
@Bringus_ a tie between WW and a link between worlds.

why did you put on Iron boots for that?
OH  HA i've never seen it with the boots before
oh so u will have a victory runback
snowpeak? did you mean AT SOUP
why are you looking for keys at the soup store
goats can be ornery little jerks
you should just go straight to cave of ordeals lul
speaking of MW i am in 1 with 68 seeds YEP
oh i would've been awesome too you do it at some point
purple haired or tunic link looks so boss
do you play mario kart with discord members?
i'd loooove to race you dude
i remember, it was so fun!
OMG i would so love to join that!
Let's get a giant group of people to play the Sonic 06 map pack in SRB2 but we're all N64 Mario
we should do mario party 7 since dolphin have online for it
i have joined discord...procrastination fixed lolz
rain likes to fall asleep to your youtube videos and it's adorable
usually how i use it in that area on normal gameplay
you don't get the bow in the normal gameplay until you go to the goron mines
i was doing zelda tp too !!
welcome to phan getting his ass kicked
yeah we were 6 on race
i ended up last cauz im the best Kappa
what are ur settings ? everything is randomized ?
yeah its the same in race
its quite the same as races then
in race u start with 6 skybooks, all overworld keys, the shadow thing to transform and thats all
bugs are disable, poes arent randomized so you can focus on just finding chest in order to do ur donjons as fast as u can
so runs are 1 to 3 hours long
but im so good i took 4 and a half Kappa
im going to sleep its 4am here, have a good one and good luck with ur seed :)
Wanna grind to master after the stream
i posted it in discord for later
its have 2 tricks in the vid btw the 1 you wanted and True Dominion Rod Chest with lja
trying to make my janky linux setup more comfortable to use
imagine having to run startx to get a graphical environment in 2024
his hands hurt because he had a skill issue
Hands started bothering me, and I don't fuck with that
first run of the day YEP
end of chapter 6 he had to leave
If it wasn't for my hands bothering me I would've finished
I got up for like 25 minutes
to be fair you kept going longer thanks to your cold shake soothing your hands LMAO
11:30-8 mon tue thu fri sat
Oh yeah I forgot about these weird chicken guys
CiTS is my least favorite dungeon
I love when they massage your brain
i made a speedrun timer once
possibly when its over the void
Did anyone see MM PC port?
I saw a Feli vid too
The way the doors and chests squeak here I ALWAYS think it's my dog whining when you're in here lol
I'm like what could he want, *looks* nvm Phantom just went through another door
technically i think i have made the smallest speedrun timer
So somewhere in field is bombs...
Sorry, ads came right away when I asked about Agatha
EXCUSE ME I JUST GOT HERE CAN YOU RESTART?
@Glennjaamin ur still here early enough.
I think you need to raise the water for those? IDK
You need a key or 2
It has been forever since I played Lakebed fully
I am sorry if it sounded like backseat gaming, they were questions since I did no know
I learned from the few randomizers I played I know very little about this game.....
Do you have lantern for those checks? I cant tell...
looks like some dude is working on dark cloud 2 rando for ap phanto274Pog
Ya its odd, especially with glitchless settings.
The only thing I can think of is under the bridge or mail
Field, you need clawshot for that rupee chest
didn't you miss a chest in city in the sky?
im pretty sure that breaks things though
like youll never be able to get bombs after that
I read that can break Rando
did you do the goron spring water thing?
Check log for bombs and continue?
you can get the log from the seedhash
go to the site and enter the hash
So we did get stuck afterall
ok so i just generated a seed to see
the full file name is Tpr-E-PatientLanayru_9z6-KgWLH6W27tV and what you want is the KgWLH6W27tV part of it
you just put that in the url of the rando site
can you copy the file name into chat so i can see feliheHmm
well, we learned a lot today
Wait did you have to bruteforce the seed to find out where?
i think iza 1 is just where you clear the river for her
she gives you a bomb abg
But its in your excluded checks list?
ya gotta get the warp point?
so guessing this check is now gonna be disable?
if you ever need to end a friendship quickly, just send this seed
you should tell axl to play this seed YEP
I know, this evening was quiet too from what I could see
somehow i was shocked cuz i thought it was a tp rando
tp rando during my fencing lessons : (
this music reminds me of golden sun
today i have learned about a new game
now morp know about 3 games
i know what ps4 game u talking about but the name idk
why didnt you heat the pizza?
It's 8 til 6 EST. We made spaghetti
oh phanto274Pog i can beat my seed in the MW
axl sent me the pulse stone last night and i was like no KEKW
what stupid settings do you have on
oh theres no entrances rando for all transitions?
and are glitches that you know on
@stalkor that is the main feature I want for this rando tbh
I want full entrence rando but dungeon rooms is better than nothing
I hate red bull ads so much
i did that for the 1st time in the MW we doing i didn't know it was free
ugh beat hallway and was 2 star point short for a level up Sadge
It's one of my mother's favorites so that's what I made her for dinner
my damage for final is jump x 2 YEP
actually have d down jump HahaSweat
damn final was a good boy and use fire
and he didn't turn 3 shield HUH
Personally I can't nut when I'm small
enjoy your magic powder i got you phanto274Smile
If you didn't get that star piece I never would've typed that message
also it wasn't on auto release
I believe you set that when you create the room on the site
i had to release and collect myself
Actually with local gen + server host, I forget if it uses host.yaml or is a setting on the site
so Imma be guessing "stupid settings" means everything?
If this is the first time, are you sure you generated locally previously?
last time we had wind waker
guess its doesn't matter too much since we can release after the seed
might have had a small update to AP maybe, as the !collect is part of the release and some games break in half w the collect being auto?
speakin from "someone rolled an AP like 2 weeks ago where both were on and LTTP got stuck in reconnect loop"
it still worked, just was super jank feeling to play
I'd double check your host yaml file, don't know if it may also have something to do with AP versions
were there any AP updates in the last like 2 weeks?
love how moustafa casually flashes you every time you meet him
yea then no clue - on my end the hosts yaml is set to "goal" for both, meaning manual if wanted to
as for where to find it: its just in the same folder as the clients are
obv. not a now thing just throwin out the info
just an Apworld browser would help there even
with a dedicated 2nd tab for 18+ games
I don't suppose you randomized puzzles then?
can mario die on OW in this game come to think PrideLaugh
Well, I finished now and released nothing but junk
imma guess that leads to like a decent timesave across the entire run for a rando? NOTED
Spin buffering is such a bizarre tech. Like, why did they program that into a turn-based rpg
So, my discord handle has some people in one of the servers I'm in uncertain of my gender.
Oh, I dind't know you have a server.
Either way, I'm greatly enjoying being deliberately vague about whether I'm male or female in that particular server.
Wait did you start with open ch6 or did you just find all the seeds already?
the other MW i am doing i just got my 1st adult item for oot after 5 days YEP
How could they make such a bop for it only to be used in one room
Pretty impressive inventory for an hour into the seed
Guess they made the crystal ball hitbox pretty tall
Oh woah ultra hammer and regular boots lol
She bought that frying pan for a dollar
ready for mario paper in 11 days
Wanna go into it blind too
mario in paper form is so scrunckly and i want to hug em so bad
What about 6 and a half
its the reason i dont run ttyd rn
that why you do any% no palace skip Kappa
It'll probably have QoL in place that makes it shorter
I'm mainly excited to hear the OST and see the visual changes
I don't understand why turbo can't be allowed within a certain threshold of turbo speed
Not allowing turb.... who the fuck just got an upgrade?
You can't fast advance the text????
...............can't wait to see you at sgdq
.......................i hope my vacation request gets approved
I land at 10:40, then I can wait for cats then we wait for phantom
9 since you put on all or nothing
I like how ultra hammer and regular boots have the the same strength
does the koopa koot stuff have to be done in order or is it your choice
when I first played this I thought they’re be way more annoying letters to find but looking back it’s pretty small to the number of letters I thought
we going for the coconut kill on bowser?
Super late, but hey hows it going!
As long as you didn't miss a coin/multicoin block
If you missed the Bub-ulb, I assume you also missed the coin ring?
thought 💭 u we’re doing ad tp
Did you get the panel near Lily in ch6?
I'm talking about me, not Mario
Both? Are there still only 2 with these settings?
We get to see the goofy Ultra Hammer chest movement
Pog you randomly showed up on my youtube been enjoying the videos
Didn't know you could swag hammer with Flarakarry
So Laki logically behind Boots+Sushie/Odd Key?
Was about to head to bed, but I caught that. Sure, take your time
i mean you could use laki to get in there Kappa
my favorite badge is attack FX E
i did look up a vid for that since in our mw i was here without bow and said nope
i only like FX E since its the older yoshi sound effect
I been playing the master quest mod, it goes crazy for real, on chapter 8 now X_X
2 1/2 hrs in and only 3 spirits yikes seems rough
Just need to do pit runs again phanto274Cry
U can always add the pit to redemptions phanto274Shrug
they have bombs under this head
and somehow pulled danger mario off with 5 HP, 65 FP, 30 BP
I had one of the two multicoin blocks be required KEKW
and didn't realize it until later
Watt showed up at like 3 hours? So I feel the pain
Goombario was cracked for me though
1 FP charge and 2 FP multibonk
after close to 3h first time boo villa uff this seed is
I missed some stuff again, where were Watt and Sushie?
Oh well in that case, Red Station->Boots->Sushie might have been the line for Laki
Wait, had you gone to Gulch/Tubba's before cheating to ch5?
My assumption was that might have been your missing Star Pieces
wher was the the key for the guy in the suers
ahh laki skip to yoshis iland
ok i need to watch i dont have any idea how you got over to yoshis iland
It's theoretically possible you skipped some logical star pieces, that's the easiest solution
Where did you get the Red Berry you have?
Watt was probably the logical path then
I think you skipped Super Boots chest
anyways you got to this point and hope you can finisch with this that you got
glitch logic means you have to do som gliches anyways?
My guess is missed logical star pieces but could be a couple things
That many? I thought it was only 3-ish out of logic
76? HUH i was guessing like 65
when do you got the super hamer?
Hmm, either that or missed Odd Key or BHS was in logic on accident
What was the command that has the doc for speedrun redeem guidelines again?
its due in 3 hours i have like 4 questions left
no they just need clips from videos
when you sai 10 star pice checks that cood be panels in the start locations that you mayby not got
Yeah I was about to ask that
"Did you say, coins and starpieces?"
Excluding the 4-5 checks you skipped
A lot easier to softlock there than in ch1
I think ch1 may be the only logically allowed softlock since you have to go out of your way
That reminds me, in the sub async, I ended up doing my ch1 full clear with 3 keys and no Laki
i had 2 keys plus laki for my full clear
i wanna know what the boock for the koopa had give you
Does that apply to all 4?
I mean, there's Laki Jailbreak for a 2-key clear
But yeah, I did staircase skip 3 times in my seed lol
Once for Bombette, once for the pit, and once to clear the capter
Wild that your super-long settings are 3:35 now
Ok  Key or the koopa kood
I remember when race seeds took me longer than that
Yeah anytime I do an allsanity desert, I'm combing every single room
I Go anyways to sleep gn8 all See the next one YT BB gn
Entrances would do stuff, you can also always turn off some QOL if you just want to take longer YEP
Entrance random ohh i wanna stay but need to sleep
You know, I was also just thinking that, vanilla items, all partners start
Yeah, there are some bad goals too
If I had the goal list, I could probably make a tweaked version for randon't
But no Boots or Hammer @mariomantaw
Some things that depend on chapter counts also are way worse in randon't
Any of Koot after ch2 sucks
Have a start in the Dessert mayby
Vanilla shops would nerf Toad Town a bit, you could also not care about coins
Yeah but you can get away with 50
I still need to get with you at some point to look into Everdrive API, there are so many potential applications now
That's always my guess when I don't know lol
i think this song is from paper mario
ALL YOU NEED IS A GAME SPECIFIC KEYBOARD FOR YOUR NINTENDO 3DS
im 4th place in pokemon typing adventure
im only a 70 wpm gamer
just for that im beating you in pokepark
SO u did get bopped unofficially
i made 2 iron bars in my pb
I get a week off soon
id technically have off that week
ugh why couldnt it have been in Philly or somewhere close
THAT MOUNTAIN OF FRIES IS STILL ROTTING IN THAT MINI FRIDGE
did they know what they signed up for?
Sounds like the sandwich was the sde
Maybe one of these days I'll go to an event or something
Yooo Phantom, how's your day been? phanto274BLANKIES
I haven't seent you in a least a few years gminus1Sob
I've been saur busy with work and stuff
Is this still extreme? The tracker layout on stream hasn't changed
It's the same kinda work ngl I've been having a rough couple shifts these past weeks
LMFAO I sometimes forget about him
I AM FREE FROM LICENSING WORK
i know why i don't have shit in the MW i am doing
so the host add race tricks to all the oot yaml and she forgot to tell the new people
That's kind of important to know LOL
doesn't matter to me since i been cheating
but for other people that put skulls without sun song to false yeah its set to true
just swimming through the ground, ya know normal stuff
i am playing oot with no hookshot and pape have no way to any chapter beside 1 and 4 without train YEP
i guess i could get to tubba castle but i rather not swim on land
Wait you can almost enter Crystal Palace with what you have if you wanted
@RavenFP sorry i am on laptop like 20 yards from my computer
my lake earlier had palace key, last item required for 7
I had 1 4 6 7, so no sushi required mostly, but I found her and what do ya know
I did my first legendary hunt took sub 9:30, translated all the braile and had new checks to learn
I basically full cleared looking for old sea map
@Glennjaamin Oh I haven't reinstalled the game even yet I just meant in general lol
It was on a check on on your tracker LUL
I forgot trick house is in the pool now
do you know all the NPCs that give berries? I know flower shop, guy by lanette's house, and guy in lilycove city
stupid settings? I like stupid settings Kappa
I thought therre were 5 total
Isn't there a farm for berries and in that house there's two berry checks?
I'm not confident, but I think there's at least one?
Well a ring of Fire is gonna have fire in the middle of it eventually, same with coins
its been fun adding stuff to emo tracker this weekend
axl’s additions look good from what I saw
no I havent yet, just the key items and setting images
I am back from going out to raising canes chicken fingers
there was a funny interaction in the AP discord. I posted my obs scene last night and one of the tracker devs couldnt figure out what tracker I was using LUL
I had canes for dinner too!
ill sharr eit in shitposting later
The other day I put on a tp rando to sleep to and then I saw myself in the chat and was disturbed
plus if I dont mark the map and dont use auto tracking what perk does pop tracker have?
maybe you marked the wrong one
btw all the stuff I added I stole from pop tracker LUL
wait I went to bathroom and get a snack.. I thought 3 wasn’t required? clicked wrong spirit?
well good thing you have been picking everything then! haha
another things, since you dont have to wake rayquaza anymore I thought about removing it from the events
You wake kyorge that go to soot city
its a nice change to speed up 8th gym too
1 turn at a time Kappa
I cant even begin to describe how hard I laughed when I got that 3rd bomb bag KEKW
the first seed I rolled I got 6 badges in 1 hour and my starter was at like level 16, So the second seed I gave myself super rod but I didnt even need it lul
and on the surf was vanilla
i know I can change it to gym wins but i like the badge setting more
there also is a new setting where it matches your level with the foe but that sounds boring
so you can remove items with a slash like //"wailerpail", but does that not work for events?
i used spike shield on jr for the 1st time today YEP
choked glitchless to cannon room NotLikeThis
and kept running into more bullets KEKW
mario needs like a sweater its cool there
idk how you mash that fast
the lightning just looked so cool
i was hoping he would shield would of been funny
have a good night ty for the stream

Why is surge of power titled wrong? LUL
I may actually have to get an X7 then
I hope it's a positive response lol
So is it just for auto splitter auto tracking and multiworld?
You need to believe in yourself
His boss was hovering over his shoulder
Today I made a list of all the npcs that give berries in vanilla
I k ew a few but wasn't sure about all of them
Also didn't know ow you could exclude checks, considering trick Master. 16 checks but they are kinda slow
And artisan cave, fuck that having progression on me phanto274Rage
I was looking over the new pop tracker. Apparently naval rock has a hidden item that gives sacred fire
Also the events tab has a toggle for every gym leader... like why? Lol
So I have the legends under events and tickets under items. Is there like a setting to hide them or am I better off just having another json to swap with?
Oh yeah, that would do it but that above my level lol
Especially if it's just for me LUL
I have done that for TP btw
Made every combination of 3 dungeons
Agumon was so real for saying that
although I dunno how to say Dare Ya in a sentence 🤔
because they hate the players PrideLaugh
YES, YOU PULLED ON MY MASTER SWORD Kreygasm
although it's kinda small. Sorry 3:
I think 6 is the average amount I've seen? I can't remember
maybe it was more like 4-5 I've seen then for the most part
yeah, those are my two blue balls from pulling the Master Sword 3:
Popping in to lurk because my brother is making me go see Hatsune Miku
i dont remember a sword beam LUL
yeah I completely forgot about that boss. When you walked in, I'm like awh shit, this guy
oh man, I forgot about that one too
It def makes for a nice more chill end game PrideLaugh
ngl, I'd have taken my lazy ass back to bed if I was Link
I trying including the free fly location on the broadcast, its like 7 pixels tall LUL
love ❤️ ur game choice glhf
yo gl on the run Phantom!
Wanted to say that I can’t believe how good the retrotink 4K looks with this too, hard to believe it’s original hardware
It really is, Pape looks fantastic too, even the with the 5x
I noticed that too. I never would have guessed there were CRT filters here too
feels like it’s hit or miss which ones CRT looks better with
Yeah can’t really improve that lol
i just realized... my whole life ive been saying kangaskhan incorrectly phanto274Facepalm
Oh no Axl, how were you saying it?
What a nice change of pace
I mean, don’t you want to the threatened 24/7? Kappa
took damage, smh time to reset
They spawn in these 2 rooms
If you're fast enough they don't spawn
I'm not sure if dying gets rid of it
Also you're taking the long route around to Cane
There's an anti fairy before Vitty
your pc is way better then mine
i only use my for emulators and twitch KEKW
phanto274BLANKIES hey yooo good luck Phantom
Yes my Bruins survived and come to a goody
was doing my own runs.....finished a decent run about a minute slower than PB
ive been there. it comes in waves
ive had plenty of cant get out of light world myself
ahhh ok. ive played minish cap, but know nothing about running it
but yeah i definitely didnt move like alttp.....so i felt the reverse
this game can hit like a truck, especially the later duneons
yeah theres a good amount of faires in most dungeons. powder comes in clutch
doesn't butter sword take 2 seconds to get if you getting silvers anyway
ganon without silver is just a spin attack when he tping
how long you been running this game?
well if you have any questions, you can definitely hit me up
moth can either be really bad or really stressful, never in between
this game has a decent amount of RNG, but a lot of good strats to handle it
minish isnt too punishing with RNG?
ignoring ice physics with boots is so nice yeah
i would recommend using fire rod in that fight....it does 2x more damage than temper sword
and splash damage can hit more than 1
i would try pushing them all to one wall, then pop them with fire rod
Minish cap hits u with the best tiers.
alright going to head out. good luck on the rest of the run. nice to meet you
Fave boss is here to stay.
I made anotherr broadcast json making a lets go tracker with gen 3 sprites
I think my first time doing that boss, I fell down that like 3-4 times
Damn that's such a BS mechanic
just a quick little one, planning on trying to stream once or twice a week
now that I have a set schedule and actual time off
you got robbed with that headshot
now that's you're mentioning more, why the fuck is that a mechanic to fall down that and have to start over?
Yeah that's absolutely insane it resets the fight
just from watching and actually paying attention this time around, it def seems like it
good thing the rando fixes that
You kinda are right Like i do Love Andy and all and did give him bits for a time being but just couldnt stay with this game.

tell my doordash driver to drive fucking faster
Who's this nerd streaming all of a sudden?
I'm at work and I'm running on 3 hours of sleep
I do have early events sometimes and they always kick me in the balls if I'm unable to sleep
I saw a Krystal model replacement and it's not the star fox one
Gtg about to be really busy
You ever wake up one day and one of your Twitter mutuals found a Fire Emblem class at their college?
Think of all the internet points I'll get by doing that
I just saw this pick up line on twitter: "You must be my appendix because I don't know what you do or how you work but I have to take you out"
I butt to learn mai before I could have butted such a minor bug with how buttnbalanced it is still buttnstalling I hate Raven so Goddamn much rn
The fuck is that statue and why is it forbidden
he's not sick though, just coughing and congested
He just needs to feel better in a week
the copium in monado's chat about remake having major glitches for speedruns is crazy
"I wish the twitter bots would at least post hentai instead of the only fans porn they do"
I was woken up cause my nyquil wore off
God that sprite is fucking jarring
i learned Toad Town Sushie Glitch today and there is no good setups  i found some 15 min vid of a walkthrough with some glitches

Grotto shuffled in tp would be interesting
Reminds me of LBW sand wand
The thing you were talking about yesterday everdrive api. Would that work with crowd control too?
it is just x amount of spot
you need to get him off screen
you forgot the chest behind the bombable wall
I need to mow the rest of the lawn in a bit but I'd be down
Only way to get there is by hovering very specifically lol
i was just typing that ice KEKW
You have full dark world access
So there's not really a point in doing aga, unless it's lumberjack locked
Only time you really need to do aga is if, you have no hammer, or no dark world access
You need mitts for this side
There's a hookshot spot on the "bridge screen"
You can also access village of outcasts from Kak
By going around through lost woods
That north room is nothing but a trap
listening to the cringe confessional upload
butttening to the butt confessional upload
it is, SO Goddamn worse than I remember
The small key can be locked behind that locked door
Hey Phantom whats your favorite legendary pokemon text box cry between? Gyaoo. Gyaaas. Shaoooh. lululalala. zaza zari za. jakiih. ji-ji-ze-ji-zoh. huaaaaann. gyararoooah. kiyuryursheeah. Kyouuuun. gugyugubah. gwobobobo. zut zutt. giygogagohgwooh. dodogyuuun! I personally really like giygogagohgwooh.  Cheer100
Sword, blue cane, red cane, and hammer damage blind
Have you got both items from Hera?
did minish cap do anything to make it better?
I was watching someone play TP for the first time and meme-ly they ran back to yeto to put the bedroom key in the soup KEKW
You got both items in hera
from emerald AP "Between a dive tunnel under the Wailmer and a dive tunnel under the Route 130 rapids, which one sounds better? Not committing to either, just thinking."
I personally like under rapids for fast access to pacilog
Dark death mountain, turtle rock, and Ice palace
Turtle rock is maybe depending on medallion
if you use the offline build you can have a check counter
Drain it or learn the diver down glitch
Wait where are you going lol
Go south in this room coming up
BK is in the big chest
line the shield up with the wall
You have to be 1 pixel into the door
Just made it here, Hope ya heart burn settles down
This is the way to kholdstare
yo glgl hope its goin well
back to see ur still hunting
I found out how to make him just start screaming with no build up
There's a very odd sense of pride in tts screams that you come up with
that kinda sounded like Mater from cars
It's a larry the cable guy tts so yea
you know i was tab out and knew who sent that message without looking
I dont remember what this one is but I have it in my notes
WHY DID I SAVE THAT ONE
I'm deleting that one that's scary
For some reason that gave me 90's horror game ambient sound vibes
Holy shit I love this sprite so much
for a second I thought "wait thats not hamtaro" - then I saw the sprite you play as
the best healing you get is a far corner up left room then mirroring - no big heals I could think of in here as is
before it goes down to the lower floor
Funny enough, dying doesn't remove spooky
could always flute to the witch spend the rupees on blues if potions
fair - just thinkin cus you were at mire PrideLaugh
Didn't purple chest give you a blue potion? Did you use it?
sky cabbages always fall and ruin days
This bot always fucks with me. I reread it like 3 times before I member what it's going for
you can open that menu with x on it
the y quick change for bottles, flute/shovel and powder/shroom exists more as QoL then tryin to eat away at a possible menu
my guess for big key gonn be 8
the book will forever elude us
Doesnt want to be eaten by a hamster
you do still have the blue potion
also small keys for key logic afaik in Ganons are shuffled in 2 sets between lower and upper
one of the blocks on the midway section can be pushed, no?
Step to the left of the final conveyor belt before fire rodding.
Tile room and you might have skipped rando room
theres a section just to the right here no?
Go left until you reach all the teleportors. Bomb left wall.
Or go right one room and wait for tiles
minimi6Notes phanto274Notes avarie1Notes gymNotes spitle1Notes tippiNotes
should have all the maps of everything
unless you already found yourself something
my guess to lttpr maptracker being not equipped with those extra maps goes to "just wasnt thought off much" tippiThink
also missed the chest again in that room with the firebars
He went back for firebar already
also big key found so *shrugs*
@DeathByAccident had it wrong cus on the linked map I sent there's eomthing marked there but its the block to push for the chest
best I could think of is mirroring out, then fluting and stocking up, then back up to this? treck back definitely is a rough one though
you could do silverless for shits? or do the staircase jump in hyrule castle unless they fixed that in rando from happening which I dont think they did
I've not finished multiple seeds for the same reason.
Sadly the magic refill is in the next room
Did you ever use that blue potion?
I've quit seeds in that exact room
They put a full magic refill in the next room as a fuck you
the rando to be fair I dont think has had that much in recent for updates, no?
The time to refresh our minds and souls are now
and I dont think ever went much past shuffling existing items, no?
Let Charizard show us da wae
Buying potion before GT is probably the best solution
blame game devs for making alttp bad Kappa
not saying you're wrong just thinkin that much of the drop related stuff is mostly on the "can it be shuffled" rather then "QoL" thought process, keeping knowledge on where resources are a "bring knowledge"
memo to keep a bomb for infinite bombs at kak for free
100% agree that it is a bad first experience
from gamedesign side I cant disagree with what you're sayin
idk what you guys are even talking about
Lets create chaos and try again
just that for rando the general recommend is "know the game" and in this particular ones case, "know where resources are" 😅
you know, whenever someone says I can make a better level, I just go, okay, make a good level on Super Mario Maker and we'll see because a lot of those levels are shit :)
this game likes to give you nothing
like - MMR towards north without goron is "do I get my bomb drop from termina field or not" if you dont have west or east access
just wanted to drop my two cents there LOL
I think a lot of randos have parts that are not beginner friendly
and I had an instance where I mowed the lawn of termina like nearly 2 times before 1 drop
didnt open the kak shack for infinite bombs for free SadgeCry
good thing is you should have access to a shop with bombs for 50 bucks per 10 at least
I have bombs if you need them since my stomach been acting up PrideLaugh
the chicken house needs a bomb (old lady w broom in front)
They should make am option that puts full refills in that room, before kholdstare, and other strategic places
as for free bombs its further left all the way down
couldnt tell ya why its not being done or thought of
though (if ok to jump into dms there) I got a couple cents to mention there in regards to MMR
tldr: you know the MM camera suck moments / heard about them?
basically, MMR in recent has had an option introduced to turn the camera into a more "player responsive" feel aka not turning on ledgegrab and making movements weird unless you know MM camera
and bc some of the race agreed settings have had that turned on there was LOTS of stupid happening
like - yea sure its not something everyone has to like
but starting fights to extents which I had heard came from it rly didnt need to be
Camera is bad, deal with it
@SwiftPichu_ I am not arguing whether it should or should not exist
With that you're just affecting not a small margin but all players
I am arguing "just because an option exists dont start fights, you can choose not to play it"
like - fuck ppl not liking an option existing
its not optional if its used for races
I can see an argument in whether its on in a certain setting to be made for the setting
Scrubs used it and I fucking loathed it
but not to the point it went from what I heard
They actually changed logic a while back to create a potential softlock. Pinball room in Skull Woods used to always be a key. Now if you drop into it without a key you might have to save and quit out.
you know, I think we all need to smoke a big fat stack of weed and talk about the Northern Lights PrideLaugh
Yeah but they dip from mm because it's not like oot BabyRage
not disagreeing that - however any race setting should be something people can discuss
and my point is not about whether a setting was discussed or not, but about "ppl made a point WAAAAY past *oh I dont like this setting in a race setting* "
It starts with one, and then it ends being a fucking modloader in an n64 game
we can agree to disagree on that pichu - as said, my point is "fuck ppl not liking settings"
as in "existing", not as in "them being on / off"
I actually made a new sprite for alttp last week. I still need to share in the alttpr discord.
i dont even like mmr races so idc about anything lmfao
oh god early moon pearl mirror
@Feli_Heli PrideLaugh I didnt mean you tippiALove
you know, people say "git good" but what if I don't want to?
you say that, you have lv1 sword KEKW
inb4 there being lamp and another sword somewhere
Started on an alien hominid sprite for SM to go with it.
or worst magic cape and lamp
that would at this point not necessarily be "worse" I feel like
just a different spice of "no pls not aga1 first dark world for early thieves town / skull woods"
cus at least cape if available lets you deal with avoiding stupid shit PrideLaugh
I was curious about charizards bunny sprite
yea true that but its not as ez as "go dark world"
Have you done a Link's Awakening Switch rando yet?
is there a rando for the switch
there also a metroid dread rando too
its when his posture corrects, the beer belly shows
zard's had a couple cold ones
curious what your stun prize is - maybe its fairies tippiTap
phantom have you ever done bingo
this pape MW i am doing is really weird i can almost beat every chapter but i cant enter said chapters
I guess you could apply the vanilla board to rando in a way still?
vanilla but with a ams file
do 3dw bingo it is garbage and bad!
thats how ive seen people doing it anyway
yea no clue on what the goals for TP would be on the bingo boards
i want more people to do mm bingo, but its very glitch heavy so rando people dont want to join, and most runners dont wanna join either
i think a lot of people do oot bingo
I would be interested, but also like - a) not feelin like strim and b) from there ppl would just get upset about it not being sent live + uploaded to yt right the fuck after
like - I dont know what the bingo cards for MM look like much, but Imma assume its a lot of know your hovers and how to get hidden owl if vanilla / rando related
not to mention rando making the vanilla bingo board options rougher I reckon
yea that explains heaps of why it would be glitch heavy PrideLaugh
a lot of goals actually require glitches lol
You can mirror to the door when save quitting to sanc.
cus like - I assume part of the glitch section is just reaching certain things like "all transforms" and such? PrideLaugh
as in "for an entertaining race it requires glitches to be doable within a reasonable timeframe"
that and also some goals are glitches
oh no 4th day so hard PrideLaugh
vote for having a goal to groundhog day link
be it via zora + human + sword or via hovering into pre clock town for double timing there on a non day 3 day
bets you know how clock interacts in both instances feli?
cus the day just starts again and link sits there be like "huh?"
silly bogus longer variant: "groundhog day link x times and play a different 3day minigame on each of them"
need swim and hammer in there, no?
oh nvm my brain didnt see you having hammer
@Feli_Heli if you dont mind (mostly for curiosity since like - as said, not feeling strim shenaniganry much currently, my mic is proper backasswards garbo)
sendin over a list of the current possible goals for the bingo board?
cus I reckon you could make that work on MMR maxshuffle seeds with glitch logic as well
ok feliheSit ill have to find the list lol
It's weird to me that the Smith charges you 10 rupees for an item after you save his life.
I only renember hearing about MM bingo like once or twice and then there being things like "oh yea fight 3/4 wizzrobes" or something
i think theres a defeat 2 wizzrobes goal
there might be more on the long settings but we only ever use the normal settings so idk
ill have to find that too catsittingverycomfortablecool
i know a long time ago someone sent me them
if catfish can also king zora and peek ledge
its rather funny that those bonk rocks sit there making it look like you cant cross
but they werent placed by gandalf fighting a balrog KEKW
time to see what the scam is quizmoPog
i think the tp bingo was actually made for rando
bottle opens up the net check at least yea
but people just started doing it on vanilla
There is a pseudo boots setting that let's you run without boots, but you can't bonk.
so the goals arent really balanced at all lol
I mean - most of the goals you could apply to vanilla could be applied to rando and other way round PrideLaugh
just that vanilla suffers from a rando induced "uhhh wait I cant do this also where quick travel" a LOT
yeah i think the goals are fine, but they need to be rebalanced so the rows arent all either super long or super short
buying a shield doesnt upgrade it once you find it
as in "stun then defeat an enemy"
i think when beest was doing bingo from ams, he was doing like double bingo so it wouldnt be too short
coulda dark worlded over here from sanctuary via lost woods with hammer at least
he paid for chest game at least
well thats all dark world access you could want I guess?
ye just peg cae is annoying
if this has the boots KEKW
Why did they never bring back skeletal chickens in later games?
nah you dont need to mirror first unless aga1 is done
its aga1 if you're in dark world afaik
at least that makes thieves town less painful
or you know - dont do it
Windows forced an unwanted update today on me
@Feli_Heli "hello, I'm from windows! -> hello, I'm from doors"
is that supposed to be for security or something?
thats nearly as glorious in stupidity as it is that windumb updates LOVE to fuck up your audio setups
but yea technically encrypting harddrives is not the worst of ideas
that sounds like a simple answer to a complex problem
THE PROBLEM is a) windows is notoriously shit at doing anything worthwhile at reasonable speeds
and b) harddrives tend to not like it happening constantly
cus as phantom mentioned: every read/write on an SSD degrades it
and if its happening in the background on a constant, no wonder that R/W speeds go down a ton from it
like - if I want to do that, I want user choice in it not being OS bound
because guess what: you CAN have it not be OS bound
and then choose at which intervals you encrypt which bits
it would surely be good not to have an OS capable of corrupting its own updates MID DOWNLOAD FOR NONSENSE REASONS doing the job of encrypting your files
cus you know - windows update just LOVES to do that for some godforsaken reasons
i have nothing on my pc i care about
i have nothing back up KEKW
AND from a "consumer perspective" its not great advertising to try and sell this when harddrives have an avg talked about lifespan of 3 to 5 years
and encryption going constantly = less lifespan for your hardware = more waste on landfills
so UNLESS YOU CARE IN WHICH CASE YOU TURN IT ON YOURSELF WITH YOUR RULES TO IT - fuck it happening automatically
damn guess they can see all my emulators and roms oh no
I don't think the small key can be on Blind
it 100% can be on blind - it could also self lock itself
Small key can be on any check
a) its not laser infused fireball bullethell, b) its an interesting fight
you do have a red potion also
if you get the chance anyway given max health is 2 hearts from him w contact / lasers afaik
its definitely the "nintendo found RNG funny" fight
yet somehow they dont like it if ppl do it in mario maker 2 PrideLaugh
Early on I would come back later after getting better armor or with a potion
I think it's left side that has a better hit box
this is near last locale logically accessible sadly
like - illogical access to death mountain is there and thats a good load of things
You can use cane of somaria
Place a block in it's path
No, the block does the same damage
didnt think of that since blind doesnt take more damage from anything really
Anything that can damage Blind does the same damage.
yea I did that many times
so dark rooms death mountain or skull woods?
are you doing basic or advanced
basic is 100% inventory, advanced is 100% locations I think
the link I sent earlier has dark rooms afaik as well
literally how you guide yourself in any dark room KEKW
Also if you get to the old man, if you die or save and quit, you start in the dark cave.
Yeah, once you deliver the old man it goes back to normal
vanilla glitchless is by going up a floor then dropping in from above
so difference between basic and advanced item placement phantom: "this setting is aimed at experienced players. intention is to maximize glitchless item placement reach. dark rooms with torches logical via fire rod, torchless ones only via lamp." as the big ones (1)
from basic further: logical restrictions for basic item placement like "bumper cave ledge without hookshot" as well as dark world always giving a mail upgrade if needed (2)
so with that in mind: non mail dark world is more common in advanced item placement
3 master sword spins kills moldorm without the enrage phase
I dont necessarily know where what is referring to things there, just know that it generally on advanced settings allows for a more open dark world in terms of items PrideLaugh
just that like - I reckon something like stupid low hearts no net / powder dark world dungeons early is also more common
aka "brain curiosity on what these settings descriptors mean"
ye with hookshot and being up here you have I think most if not all of hookshot cave?
like - there's a couple things
surely this leads to a fire rod at least
cus lamp cant be here without flute
dont you end up atop the mountain anyway after this
@stavros12c34anenoglou is it glitchstick aka blue cane?
@Jonxhas blue can and ice rod. Clothing wise its red cape
I wish I'd like ice rod
but its a literal ice rod in the sense of it being anywhere barring on / behind trinexx
and if I learned ANYTHING from boss shuffle, then ALTTPR with boss shuffle LOVES early trinexx
that doesn't do anything for blind sadly
coulda started at sanctuary for the health refill then tried blind again maybe
cus that buffer is now increased at max at least
You can buy a red shield to make Blind easier.
you know whats harder then blind just starting lke that
can you use somaria there too
HATE this dungeon btw purely for this key door here
literal trap room to waste a key
Blind's movements are based on Link's movements. Runners have figured out a "script" for a perfect Blind fight from the middle of the room. There is no script for if Blind is already in the room.
isnt mothula 1shot by the silvers as well?
I don't think bow does damage to mothula.
yea mothula is just swords, hammer, canes and fire rod v.v
also with this - isnt the BK key locking itself then
there's the one chest down at the gibdo
cus ^ you can drop into here
That small key is no longer guaranteed
but yea this feels suspiciously like BK in BK chest to me rn
that key should be guaranteed in race settings still
why? you dont need BK to open anything but BK chest in Skull woods
it self-locking itself is not uncommon in there
just as likely as it being in the back side or on mothula
I thought it wasn't guaranteed in advance logic as long as it isn't an entrance rando
so the usual "hype cave aint hype cave" cave moment
not to mention even basic logic could have a self-locking BK chest in Skull woods
similar I think possible in desert palace too
the LTTPR emotracker pack open I reckon?
need to check if mine has updates or not, last I renember it has not accounted for dungeon items like ever
there not a way to get to boo mansion without super boots or forest pass right?
no way to cancel sushie glitch in forest right? since you cant open the poles
charizard X was blue + black right?
I believe that's a shiny charizard reference
shiny charizard of 2nd gen must be then
damn pretty sure i did every possible check in both my MW seeds Sadge
cus gen2 didnt have good colors for anything yet
Shiny mega charzard X is that color
I mean it still does save time
If you can do it regularly
come to think dummy thought: you know fake powder or nah?
I dont know how specifically fake powder works just that it exists
game tryin to shove me places
It takes 8 fire rod shots to melt his ice
Fake powder is very easy. Have no magic. Use red cane and immediately pause. Switch to mushroom or powder. Unpause.
You can use mushroom as powder or use powder without magic.
You could fake powder magic bat first.
I mean you can give the witch the mushrooms see what it is and reset your console
lmao thats a funky trick KEKW
There's alot of fun tricks in the randomizer, like deleting blocks with the mirror
It is also useful for powdering antifairies
I mean I know you can delete blocks / hookshot through them
but its on the list of "I am not good at them" PrideLaugh
Its not to bad just have to time it while the block is mobile
@sselwalf last I tried, I did try at the top of ganons and mirrored back to entrance KEKW
DP is also decently short even if pendant
There's your problem, you can't do it in dungeons, only overworld and caves
so in ganons I woulda had the NEED to use hookshot then
to hop through the blocks instead
love that that shows how I do know this game but not deep enough for those types of silly bogus PrideLaugh not even mentioning any big map traversal shenaniganry
and then to death mountain after here for lamp just for firerod to return to skull woods
quite a nasty roundabout for that
Logic is a useful tool, sometimes we ignore that logic
logic is useful for knowing what not to do
sadly an ice rod was required in the seed, so everything's on the table PrideLaugh
thats now 2 in their vanilla chest, no?
Diver down, but I've never got it down
i know you have to jump in water 1st
Andy last has a tutorial on youtube
You will need magic, to make a Samaria block
There is a bomb set up that doesn't need somaria.
sorry about it being gif based PrideLaugh took the first link which came up and given LTTPR wiki had to be on the money
links shadow also always is the same, no?
get out is on the right corner of the stairs
You have to hold up right when you get out
its like a small movement right before exiting water for wall
Alright I gotta head back to work, good luck with your run
not important for logic anyhoo ye
also sorry for the gif based one at first, just was the first "this looks promising" thing 😅
idk I think Wart is more annoying
true if you fight wart normally
if you fight wart w bombs = easy
w zora fins? annoying as shit, I'd rather fireless wart w bow then
MMR has made me despise that fight
to bombos is dark world from swamp palace side
you items tell me other wise
@blacktiger51 how would you get checkerboard cave without flute?
yeah that what i mean where flute
can still finish the backside at least, no?
and small keys on backside all are in pots
just keys from pots you could bring to front
There is about a 50% chance that desert is boots locked in any seed
If either key is on torch
so then for items you just bring a key from backside to front
back here its just keys after keys
so you can bring a key for the BK chest over to front thats about it
to see if BK is vanilla for that
Logically it would be behind boots
cus need to account for worst key usage always
south of links house hammer to dark world, then over to where chest guy is, mirror back
blind item is gettable, pyramid fairy is
other then that its now PoD time rly I guess
good thing? PoD is the good pendant
the one moment where Aga1 can be useful outside of first dark world
yes? unsure / dont know, I just know the backside of escape triple near always can end up being items
what would be rude is if your boots are on blind
cus its a bit of an annoying fight to get through and all
I think this dungeon on chests has 6? or am I dumb there
2 down here, one behind the key door which at this point needs to be another small key, no?
cus you need one for boss side?
turtle rock you got everything for
There is a 1/22 chance you need boots for GT big key
it could also be in TTT
thats like 4 times the health you had before
NotLikeThis  someone have to beat pokemon blue for my hammer
WELL IF YOU DIDN'T LET THE FLAME GO OUT ON HIS TAIL, MAYBE HE WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS ohheyi30Angy
where his ice beam modCheck also fuck 7tv
but what if boots in here
You can steal the key before the big key check
without boots cape byrna OR mirror shield yea
i just void out and use i frames for the chests here
You can use I frames to get the top and bottom chests
cus your way back is the roundabout from old man
just thinkin cus of no half magic
before thieves town I reckon the thought would be?
as in before blind in this case
hiding away powder somewhere to at least?
cus then mire woulda been potential
as much as the travel convenience would have been there
otherwise torch lighting reveals the path
but yea the path is revealed by torch being lit or by ether use I think
If you leave an item besides a small key on the torch, bob is glitched.
BK and half magic is a good double there
bets powder is behind that too
is this alttp with different skins?
LTTPR has had access to sprites for link for a while
then why does title say hamtaro rando?
bc the previous seed phantom was hamtaro to the past
now its charizard who escaped the pokeball
Everyone is thrown off by the pink hair. Don't worry about it.
yeah, Link got gangrene and never treated it, so instead of green, he just turned purple
he's going to die after this
charizard overcharged from being deep frozen before KEKW
Always pick up that bottom skyll
dont be rude with your geometry wars
why did that make me laugh?
so today ganon is a bug researcher?
Aw yeah, 2.5 seconds EVERY teleport
Omg you got the frame perfect hit
^ that was a silverless hit not a stun hit
The fire bats reverse your controls for a few frames too
actually? thats lowkey dumb that that interaction of damage + ledge be like that
Btw be careful in this room after killing ganon
as for silverless: basically you're aiming for the frame right before teleport each time
as in "slower then silvers just in inventory" for rando anyway
given in vanilla its a diff case there
could be behind flute / boots on OW / mire
I have had seeds give me net REAL early
only needing one med is like having 1 needed for both
brain tired and hinging on wakey brain by rambling game silly bogus
It's one of the buttons you hold
and the mad friend sleeps again
The community also calls the purple chest guy Gary
how could we not know them all?
they were purposeful bonks too KEKW
I dont know off the top of my head
you got 10 heart containers through dungeons yea?
should be 10, so 28 total heart pieces in the pool
without any difficulty settings to it
You hear it in all bosses
Nope not the case blackTiger I was here.
Oh man were doing this live
Yay ur giving this another chance!
Ive never seen this before. Is this still a rando?
gathered that as soon as you got sword lol I love this
For a sprite it's good enough
Is that the nintendo power glove
This is like, demake not remake KEKW
I think they are just called power gloves
But there is now an enby flag on the mexico top 8 banner
@Pallos7 supergrenas and a mexico player I haven't seen b4
You know what would be cool Mario and Luigi fusion danc but that would be kinda off like goku fusing with Gohan.
Hey if you dont want your 20 dollars I'll take it
why is this guy so pissed
can you heal please this sound gotta go
ya, that's why i do 1/4 heart sound speed
he was gonna inherit it anyway
I'ma do that to u when u die then
I mean this is the song you mostly hear in bowsers castle
You're def in there more as peach
Did you make it send paper mario
did you hand select the ost?
forever forest in lost woods was just lucky then?
I think I know what that is PrideLaugh
its the Mario & luigi map icon when both are in a room together
except its kind freakin out cus it doesnt know how to rotate well
ohhh ok so ttyd themed there
depending on key luck I mean
Luigi my boy! I told you to stay home!
it's fun how glitchy this game is even though you see basically none of it casually
thats why dark rooms being learned is great
you never want to see me try EP dark rooms PrideLaugh
especially the one with pot / skull key
I ALWAYS stub myself somewhere dumb and then hug the skeletons like a dummy
mikesrpg is good for dungeon stuff
I think there's also a webpage for all OW related dark rooms
The reason why its called Legend of Zelda is bc she is just as much of an interictal part of the game as u. Plus it rolls off the tongue better than Legend of Link like we need another LoL abbreviation.
its a 50/50 for them to be that over boss you mean
Unless this next check is a latern.
Less than one week away for ttyd, Anyone else hyped?
I honestly only am just because my OG copy disappeared somewhere so we can't play it on anni's gamecube
Loving the Paper Mario music combined with this.
If this was Link's Awakening that would solve our latern problem.
don't think I've heard flute song rando'd
iirc, Someone once said the actual song in the code affected whether or not the flute works. Got changed once and broke everything each time they tried it
Got a spanish ad for kohls, but the phrase "self care" was still english kinkaiConfused
Have we ecncountered grubba's theme yet?
I'm curious what Mario turns into without the pearl... I'm guessing a little oink.
Imagine if latern is locked behind Fire Rod. **knocks on wood**
you say lantern and i keep thinking lantern ghost
great 1st hr start and finds
no no, that's a precious ruby deathf1Hi
that's about the only place that matters sakoneLaugh
Or it could be Big Key in Big key chest. crystaLUL
a lot of dark world bosses require fighter spin or master to hit
but switchin to hammer every couple seconds is shite I bet KEKW
not to mention arghus himself will be a GOOD COUPLE SPINS / HAMMERS KEKW
It's just like Paper Mario, fr fr
at least blue mail, right? 🙃
I think you can also bow arrghus once he's de-popcorned
but I cant tell you how many arrows
Curious if any of the spells work on Argus?
the med spells are always a bit whacky on whether they apply damage or not
hammer / bow definitely will work here, and are respectively more cozy imo then fighter spins
dvd logo with added mario load bar
time to go back in for the item right 🙃
Honestly it would have been better if it wasn't Big Key. XD
Arrghus always goes downright after falling btw, so you can go upright and shoot down pretty consistently
you can clawshot locations while riding epona... this game keeps giving
anyone turtle rock on fighter sword? KEKW
Honestly I would have laughed if that was a level 2 sword locked behind that mess. XD
but TR is quite obnoxious as a dip dungeon similar to how pod can sit
@Jonxhas I have had to do that before. It wasn't fun yuraSadge
btw if no one has said anything these filters look so fucking clean
@rebeka_139 hey - I was too dumb reading what settings mean with LTTPR before, rolled myself a seed without heartpieces and had green mail fighters 3 hearts Mire KEKW
does 5X have a setting like this?
@Jonxhas hell yea, that sounds like a good challenge
@rebeka_139 it was, but ended after I fought that boss cus I was exhausted from running in circles for 15min KEKW
couldnt be bothered, I'd rather play the missing link again with its extended swordless start
hammer is lotsa damage for wizzrobes
if that was the concern anyway KEKW
I know you got lv1 sword
cant wait for there to be no boss where you want high sword left and you get like buttersword right then just for dorf
kinda wish death mountain had mt rugged instead of this theme
as shit as it would be on the magic consumption through the dungeon
then again fighters kholdstare is worse then fighting blind on ice
@rebeka_139 hey - I take on ice over conveyor UNLESS it is trollmold KEKW
burger circle RNG fest just gets stuck on them and you can freely spin him
though helmacopter is at least funny to look at
for reference phantom: helmasaur freaks out with its tail if not in its arena at times
and the tail just goes places
similarily, trinexx and some boss arenas freaks out the color palette something fierce
or cant you run the solo LTTPR seeds thorugh an adjuster thingy?
there's good and bad palettes at least. bubblegum pink IceP is great
its just like playing terraria at that point, not ice palace but hallow palace PrideUwu
sounds like they ended up with a cursed palette
we sure want to fight goodpendant trinexx KEKW
cus like - a) potions = backup magic, could even do 2 blues 1 green specifically
given where your half magic is
would assume it should still work
yes, what it gives is random though
but not 100% given the items are spawned
so phantom could get bees tippiBee
it can give empty bottles, which is kinda dumb
thats hilarious as dumb as it is
paper mario using power quake on the pegs
do you know about the caves with rupees rebeka and if so, how to get into them reliably?
I dunno the name of it
w/o flippers i know the cave west of witch. i think you can bomb into sanc hole too
yea then thats what I mean
there's many ways, but those are the two easiest
cus that'd at least give you more money for potions if ice palace
didnt know you had net cus brain derp so yea truthfully just a green potion for magic back up for IP sounds valid then
you only need 3 bombos uses for IceP if you clear in one go
also this room here the chest not always being a small key kinda is scary
@rebeka_139 AND dont get dunkede by kholdstare
yay back in logic an hour later
btw, strawberry banana rogue is pretty good. mostly banana flavor though, just a hint of strawberry
i'll get that next time then
it does take over 30 normal arrows to do this boss, kinda annoying that
if I make it to all these shifts, I'm set to make $360 at ComboBreaker
I'm shooting for at least $400
Post Acen sore legs hit different
by logic no, 99% sure logic requires silvers for all kill ganon seeds
tempered silverless is pretty easy tbh. now I can't remember if master sword works for silverless though...
excuse me, your copy of LttP looks broken...thought you'd want to know
no no, this is Paper Mario
im actually moving back to WA in like 2 months :O
Yup...fly down a few times a year
and so far, the music respectively if counting dungeons would line up with the chapter count?
then again - nah I dunno, that math dont add up cus then this would need to be ch6 music not ch5
cus you get 3 light world then this being technically lv3
Mothula being a normal battle theme makes sense at least for an easy boss
Oh yeah forgot to say if im not typing myself in the foreseeable future its because i had a mental meltdown for 10+hrs yesterday.
its the underground section of bowsers no?
upstairs can be a different theme iirc
my head thinks about the couple "dlc" rooms of rando aka the dark rooms
just do aga1 and do silly haha silverless
and then on the final bit where you would normally stun -> silver, you instea stun -> wait for him to unstun and right before he teleprots you spin
basically you want to hit last frame of him standing before the teleport enacts
charge up spin > side step bat > spin attack as he teles
^ what rebeka says = the quicker variant, afaik both ways work though, no?
I think so because spin attack hits on a ton of frames
I defiintely renember doing it with the stuns so you dont have to do the bat dodging - timing is rougher on the spin release then though cus you get bonke away from the slash
either way: silverless is not the worst of things to do
did you have a speedrun resource or rando resource for it?
or just a text description of it?
where did u find my fave item ice rod and cape and red rod
ice rod was ether, somaria was swamp big chest, dunno about cape
and swamp big key was on boss
either way towards silverless definitely understand it being not an ez thing - for me what it toook to do it was an AP multi where I ended up seeing my silvers behing behind a jank ass chain of events to happen
I mean, you kinda couldn't with it being 7 crystals to enter
so I just chose to do silverless instead
its not uncommon cus you could also just have it be literally 2 checks = silvers
they can be more anywhere than ice rod
and bow is rather important in LTTPR as is
like - yes its a "worse ice rod case" but also there being 2 which could be considered by logic makes them more prone to happen from what I feel like w it
guaranteeed fairy spawn every room entry on tree fairies afaik
i think there a few between phase one and two that don't count. ad
Mario picking it up is so funny!
plus stuff you just saw like zora ledge
AP version does include those as checks even if its guaranteed smalls outside of keyshuffle
do you have a couple partytrick runs? cus I mean like - LTTP any% haha LMAO exists
where you save&quit from jumping off a ledge mid jump and just waddle to the credits
Links Awakening runs is my ultimate cloud 9
lttp any% is down to 1:33
is it multiple BN's or just one worth of music?
I'll vaguely know what music is from where. watched a ton of BN, never played it
Megaman shall save the day Mario wasnt enough to handle the DoritosChip DoritosChip DoritosChip beestTOS avarie1TOS beestTOS_HF
I don't recognize it at all
just don't attack upward and hammer is great :3
like - I think its similar in strength to lv2 swordß
most things work on them. byrna would be better imo
do you rly want more lag on the already near lag fight? PrideLaugh
not saying its a bad option at all PrideLaugh
it's an option more for boss/door shuffle. arrows are just so fast
either way an optin to keep in mind cus you could super blank on getting arrows
and then be in there arrowless
ya, mire into eastern, something like that
its just a coinflip surely you're right
no way would there be a vanilla bow KEKW
so are there not many in DP - but there's more options then hera, thats for sure
and last I renember, the most heavily key locked one of the light world dungeons is DP
wait... how paradox / spiral w/o hammer/hook? or am I dumb
is the hammer check in dark world
hera you can clear with what you have
just that you logically would need to drop down to big chest
so renember how in I think thieves hideout, is it? where you peg yourself?
could do the same here with a bomb tippiTap
and just have a chill peg ride
thats a long fanfare hoooly PrideLaugh
is this prepping for super early trinexx? KEKW
Golden Mega so pure so extra so gasm
hype cave more like scam cave after paradox
I feel like this was a not so hype cave, hiding goldman KEKW
Double the Goldge GoldPLZ popesGoldKan phanto274Gold spitle1Gold popesGoldKan_SG
so about that trinexx KEKW only a glove away, huh?
also w firerod I see you rushing mothula over going all the way back up to there anyway KEKW
damn i miss the whole seed
friends made me play destiny 2
yea but this seed just started though
i been gone for like 2 hours
damn in the MW i am doing i got silvers already and cant even beat 1 dungeon KEKW
thats a rther weird pendant spread
cus that in my head = fingers crossed late mire crossing / access via flute/hook whith bot respectively are real good items as is
turn nature rules upside down w the moth being beaten by bees?
basically what I mean is: there are certain species of moths which specifically lay their eggs in close vicinity to hornet nests - and last I renember, bees and hornets are related to another
reaso of the moths doing that is so that the larvae can then munch on hornets for growth
my only reason to know that is cus around here there's a hornet nest somewhere closeby and there's been LOTS of moths of a particular type around
so me got curious and looked shit up PrideLaugh
and for nature / science related things, wikipedia luckily isnt quite as bad a resource as for history as an example - obviously grian of salt on that since wikipedia can be tinkered with and all that but science related things tend to be the most not wrong no?
tippiGiggle woulda needed to have ran back into the chest
I see you've finally come to your senses and started running a Mega Man X game
there's different prize packs in this game. one of them is mixed, one is pure magic, the rest don't have magic iirc
ya, this dungeon sucks on the magic front
there's a setting called psuedo boots. don't know if the website branch has it, but it allows dashing with boots, but not bonking or opening bomb doors
that only in the offline build the website doesn't have it
phantom I do not mean to alarm you but i think something is wrong with your mega man
hope all is well btw I haven't checked in to ur stream in a long time
And then randomly put my headphones in and heard the sounds
And was like "wtf is happening, why am I hearing SAVE OUR PLANET"
wait cant you use the medallions with any sword?
you should beable too use it
found magic in yo pockets tippiTap
ya, starting half magic or an inf magic setting would be nice
could just set to start with half magic and enable 1/4th magic as the upgrade yea
without hookshot down first then while going up you do the right ones, then shoot down on the way back
for timing: while on the inner ring, 2 times right, 1 down
at least mirror in here spawns you with a full magic refill
hammer over the fence works, grab the wall and lure them like pod mimic clip
also given you have mirror you could just charge spins like vanilla to block the lasers
when lookin it up, its on his right, when lookin down its on his left
memories of nintendo not being the best at game design be like
case in point: skull woods having a literal trap room to waste a key
the only hookshot logic I could think of is the first gap, but dunno if advanced logic takes bonk wall gap closers into account
could before mire always do DP rl quick
had an item on the torches
IP sounds easier to go through without magic at least - could also dip pendant swamp with the flippers
or rather: with low amounts of magic used
anyhoo I need to snooze been awake for nearly 20 now
good cozy times I hope come with the end of the seed threat2Love
How have seeds been? I saw u playing as Mario earlier
you also need bow to enter toybox
Anyways I'm gonna vibe and decompress, I am having general tech problems and :)
you ever chase a bug in the code like, all day without success
well it can since there 2 bows
avarie1GG phanto274GG gmonPogging popesPOGGERS_TK he can deal with triforces powah
thanx for giving this game another chance
Oh cool I got a Bow badge
come on 60 piece boots Kappa
Odds are good one of those Kooper Ups are fake
This is a 7 spirit seed I presume?
Rowf has the power to reverse space
lurking, have a *sees random mirrored rooms* good? seed
Couldn't stay long. Just wanted to pop in and chill for a few minutes. Good luck with the seed and fixing your sleep
oh god the mirrored threw me off LOL
I really wanna get back into rando but i'm not supposed to be sitting for to long rn :(
A disk in my back is wearing out and i'm suppose to be up more Which hurts like hell
every time it's mirrored i think i'm losing it LUL
i fall asleep to youtube vods so often
pape in 2024 is kinda crazy
fish in the wrong tree today
so is the diamond stone not in logic for a long while then?
sup phantom. it’s been a minute!
I wanna say it was either rugged or the desert
man youre just too good at this. Mirrored would have me so bass akwards
Is it every other room is mirrored?
what about mirrored and dungeon shuffle LUL
That coin is gonna make a difference
Is that a lush Augumon on your bed :O
well i almost lost my whole team but i caught a volcanion lmao
it was also on floor 73. wasn't even a set of 10 boss
just went "sup i'm here to fuck your run up"
He's running away from the bills
im hungry and want popeyes but i dont wanna wait an hour for food
popeyes do be making you wait an hour in the drive thru
Popeyes ain't been hitting like it used to
there will be uber eats at SGDQ. they're not shutting down uber/lyft
so 5am taco bell is happening
last couple times I've had it, it wasn't satisfying
they always give me spicy instead of what i order
i don't like pickles on a chicken sandwich
i like cold pickles, not hot soggy pickles
i dont think ive ever had a pickle cold
but i'm also a savage, and i'll buy a jar of jalapenos
ive only had popeyes ones NiceSoftlock
and eat them with a fork
me and this bag of crutons
what a strange looking ALTTP Rando
quick someone give phantom 10 gift subs to pick it up iceblueSmug
so the snes mini controller I use for gba has a loose A button now
so gonna try swapping the XY with AB, doing a teardown now
still on my mental break here for my watch streak.
it's not but like...when you tell yourself not to over eat and then do it anyway
not as great as Church's but it's awesome
i tried canes the other day and while i absolutely demolished it i still put it a tier under popeyes
they have a good meat to skin ratio in my imo
el pollo loco is pretty decent
i used to work there, was honestly not a bad job
it's nice if you're in the mood for grilled chicken as opposed to fried
gonna go put up dishes...just wanted to see how TTYD is going so far
41% one big, 26% 2hr, 21% 3hr, 13% 4hr
20+ is 41%. 2 per part is 26%. 3 hrs is 21% and 4 is 13%. other is 0
cuz i voted for it KEKW
listen, it'd be great for my 20 hour naps
actually...i think you would get more revenue if it's 2 per part
you have the voice of a story teller
Exploring Series the SCP guy is the same way
@couragekitten for some reason it's different for me. i would listen to Game Grumps and sleep even though they say the dumbest things
love how you called him stupid earlier xD
I forgot are guards also random with that
i'm in the undersea biome on pokerogue. i just found a trainer, pokemon breeder
it leads with a pidgeot. sir why are you throwing out a bird ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN
i mean whether it's surrounded by water or air, electricity fries it all the same lmfao
@Mirby_Studios fool that you are, our kind does not adhere to the laws of the land
or for that matter, the sea either
so the buttons themselves cannot be swapped
Oh god why are only some of the screens flipped. this is horrendously cursed
Insert hotel mario voice clip here
OMG IT'S LUIGI I didint know you can play as him is super paper mario
Do you think the 8Bitdo Retro Receiver for SNES Classic will work with raphnet?
its only 17 bucks on amazon and id be able to use my switch snes controllers with it
2 hrs in and your basically done
simply be less good at the game
no free shipping, my brother has prime so ill ask him toorder it for me
yeah, but im not paying for $7 shipping
I got one of those prime free trials and I can't even use it for a free sub on twitch and I'm very sad about it. Let me cost Bezos some bucks
the race seed I did with levias, with were missing 4 partners at final LUL
I used to be able to do it but it doesn't give me the option
it's like Schrodinger's Twitch Prime. I get the badge and some stuff but I cannot actually sub to anyone. Yeah same tho I was surprised. Prolly too many people made use of it. Alas
ew I just realized this is 7 scaled
4 being 7 scaled is the worst
reddit has confirmed the snes toggle works with raphnet and that was 8 years ago, so that works for me
this is a wii doggle but that shouldnt matter at this point
I think it’s time for 9:21PM pizza
What, not using it against 7-scaled General Guy? 😏
when I was doing pokemon today I thought I was in go mode so I was skipping checks, but forgot I needed go goggles to reach regirock. I didnt want to back track so I gave up. Turns out they werre in abandoned ship which I never visited LUL
I thought for some reason you were gonna say 'in the toilet'
I should get 3D modelin, I'm gettin in some Jp carts Arie picked up and I do not wanna have the cartridges raw dogging the 64 slot
my 64 is standard, so unsure. I could dremel down the bits but I'd like to have the replacement tray just in case
I would say I don't trust myself to do something like that, but I can do etch cuts very cleanly on typical circuit boards so
I wanted to get one printed off shapeways as an excuse to get a few other things printed but I may check Etsy if they already have one handy
it's like matching underwear, it's the thought that counts
guy I met recent said he wants to try the emerald rando, he's in for one hell of a tutorial LUL
Are you going to play the new TTYD?
Hope I can catch most of it
Doing the same most likely too
I wonder what's gunna be different
I only go on twitter to see what my retro game shop get in lol
I saw all that, but honetly I dont remember it LUL
I find it easy to go days without twitter now
Remake will be my first time playing TTYD YEP
I saw one clip of a guy freaking out about a toad that wasn't there before and that's all I know
youve had 20 years, whats the hold up?
there is one big thing I remember that will effect speedruns
@Axl_SR Ah yes, I was definitely going to play the game when I was 3 years old and didn't own a GameCube Clueless
I hope they fixed the puny jank
lol, I was 3 when snes released
oh, no wonder I forgot about it
What did u all think of my hero academias ending?
mirror mode messes with my eyes sometimes
Stavros, I jsut googled it and the first article titled "My Hero Academia's Ending Isn't Just Great, It's Redeeming the Series" LUL
Goddamnit Phantom now I'm looking at shit I don't need on Etsy
this is always so funny to me cause it means none of the boos were digested. meaning they were just... chilling out inside tubba. why couldn't they just escape?
Gating certain tech to certain versions for speedrunning is so cringe
my fave character can u please take me to cloud 9 and finish me off.
I spent less on Etsy than I woulda spent on shapeways!!
gmonSadge PoroSad spitle1Sad my wallets lost.
I'll get my Game Boy Color inserts later
I am pretty sure I have one
for resident evil 2 and 3 og must be the pc version for speed runs
strim went well until I kept being an idiot
which surprisingly makes it hard to PB
maddy almost just accidentally got me megadrunk lmao
poured about twice as much whiskey as they intended into the cup when making me my mixed drink tonight
but they're really good at putting it back so it just went right back in the bottle lol
@Mirby_Studios i just mixed absolut jack daniels and cranberry
I just saw a crazy announcent and let me say nothing has had me this excited so far this year
pokemon gen 1+2 anime 279 episodes + movies has been english subbed with 3rd and 4th gen on the way
I remember when #pocketmonsters started subbing gen 1 like a decade ago along with the current episodes but gen 1 was dropped 35 episodes in
i just got here and was going to lurk and then saw the room before general guy be backwards
welcome to- shut the FUCK up bot- hell
Only *some* of them are and that's worse tbh
for a little while at least. Even if it does hit you I think
youll get a kick outta this, today I entered Norman's gym at 40 minutes, I left the gym at 1:25 KEKW
he led with double intimidate magby LUL
is there a random room shuffle inside dungeons?
is complete entrance rando every room, or just like doors and stuff
there was a single dungeon room shuffle seed. Smith, I can send you the patch file if you want it
if only I had anything to run pape randos I would haha I have iPhone switch 2013 MacBook
thats more advance that the N64 I use LUL
You also use an Everdrive which spensy
you wouldnt believe how much I spent on 4mb off ram lol
One day I will have an Everdrive... one day
Yeah I got lucky on my expansion pak off ebay back before retro really got popular
I traded my copy of ff7 for a xpansion pack and dk64
I bought one off ebay but it didnt work for me, I got my refund and just went to my over priced game store in the mall
A part of me wants to mod this 64 to be like Crystal Themed
I want to get a second gamecube
but it's like :va ... I'd have to resin pour to get the sparkleys
Did you do LAN parties with them? phanto274Pog
I actually dont need that media loader anymore
I got like a $7 SD card reader but it looks like a normal gamecube memory card
GBI... Gameboy related I take it?
aNother funny thing, norman gave me dynamo badge and sludge bomb man gave rock smash LUL
I couldnt beat a quick seed in sub 6. Youre out here just casually dropping hard mode in 4
and white herb girl gave mystic ticket for level 70 Ho-oh, we were crusing
Still gotta respect it. its wild
the only way it could be more perfect is if you had 86 fewer coins lol
popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_HF phanto274GG phanto274GG gmonPogging gmonPogging avarie1GG avarie1GG popesPOGGERS_SG popesPOGGERS_TK
bros first words were "gonna do one seed tonight, its gonna take 5 hours"
you could do 2 different seeds over AP by yourself LUL
I dk how you could make it harder.
You could play with Slow Go on-
oh what if... hear me out. You played with your feet
sounds like you need a new challenge good thing ttyd is coming
you could lower the badge pool
hope we get full er 1 day
I was gonna say limit badges
i know the crates you can break
I'm fine with it along as it not force
did you do random start location?
I cant remember if I mentioned this to you
I was watching your vod and you had th ehiker on the cable car. That was a 1/64 chance
Its my birthday to because i was first
What happens if i redeem a short speed run
my 1 cat is like that too he loves boxes
my cat will sleep in the box
i remember i have this game on snes
is that an octo plushie 😱
have you ever tried programming for a game console
is that what your job is lol
a while ago i made a gamecube game
and by game i mean a free floating first person camera and some objects i made in blender and basic collision detection lol
i wanna do that more but i keep getting distracted with work and shit
i did try to make a super monkey ball like thing, but i realized its not easy to figure out how to check collision against weird shapes
i figure youd have to use the normals of each triangle that makes it up, but then thats a lot of triangles to check
i never thought to get a book specifically for that lol
i have physics for dummies 1
Got time during the Master Sword
The bonking strat is very lenient
Honestly? It probably wasn't your fault
Since Link walks 2 pixels then 1 pixel
I'm guessing you slept early last night
Would you like me to show you stuff tonight after I get back from the gym?
best gal will stay with us
Yeah you gotta let the hit knock link out of the charge animation
Just know that ice palace you need 100% magic for kholdstare
if you miss 1 shot, you have to mirror
what in the actual fuck was that
i was tab out that scared the fuck outta me
That's why i love that one he just comes out swinging
The other yells have build up
i hope ur well! i got some prime rib for lunch so im feelin niice and cozy blobComfy
I had half rack and a jack/absolut mix dinner yesterday
It was on the house bc a random customer heard my plight of losing my wallet.
Cheer100 Shadow: I gotta cover up this beeping kkona: Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheue Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheue Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheue Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheue Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheue Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha heheheh huehuehueheue Kkona: hehehe huehuehueheue hehehe hahahaha hehehe
I'm not sure why I lost my streak either
now just have to practice pre-throwing the bomb to blow the wall
huh, I thought you had to be right on the stair to do spin speed
I must always be lucky then
Played this game as a kid and needed like 4 months to 100% it, but man, good times lol
Didnt even have a guide and i didnt know the red sword existed and stuff like that, until i played for 4 months lol No internet back then, so without a guide, tough luck knowing shit like that
Or was it gold?, i thinkm it was gold
yeh, but try to find that shit out when you are a infant
just send a letter to Nintendo
excuse me sir, but you seem to have misplaced your shield.
Iam from EU, what are phones? Seriously, i was in the DDR back then, we were lucky we had TVs lol
yeah that would've been like 3 months wait by mail
I played mario paint with my first GF lol
well, not for long, until we figured something else out LUL
googles AI probably just freaking out, it such a iconic track
he sucks ass if you have fighter sword
i believe you can kill him with white and normal magic if you are prefect
Whats the story behind why he was a pig in this?
I also clenched my teeth with that hit
but you got there. Bruised, but you got there!
off to dinner. Have fun, friendo
awesome 😎 run 🏃 no need to huff about it
you have to spin attack btw or its does 0 damage
you can slash with fighter sword
i was double checking but yeah it's 16 slashes/8 spins
which sonic music pack is this? I don't recognize it
andy said you couldn't so phanto274Shrug
oh, that explains it, never played
@RvPA so my r2 for my controller for pc doesn't work so about that re 2 remake MW i need a new controller Sadge
i really don't understand if it not taking damage when hit against the spikes was intentional or like, badly coded boss
such like a wild oversight lol
if you get the offline build you can start with fake boots
lttp is the boomers of rando and i'll always stand by that lol
"back in my day, when didn't even have custom sprites!! 👴"
pot sanity enemy and boss shuffle and i believe dungeon room shuffle
combo rando is up to date everything on the website
and it'd also be different if it wasn't THIS rando
that has tons of people to do it
Phantom personally reaching in, updating the website themselves, putting 'you're welcome' in obnoxious lettering somewhere, and then leaving
just like... as a size comparison
That's what I mean by personally reaching in
i think you thinking of mmr
yuuup. it's big for mystery seeds too
ap sucks to roll a seed but its not that bad
the bush in kakariko should spawn bombs right?
use rod pause and switch to mushroom
pause on the same frame when u use rod
SOnic and pegasus boots truly work well.
wasn't that a light world check
oh shit yeah i forgot about that
yeah that's a real dumb portal lol
I'm assuming this is a MSU-1 thing
I see u got speed shoes
and now I'm being told my messages have conflicts with the settings
is this sonic and the black knight?
Definitely don't recognize one of the tracks but it might be from one of the bonus levels in SRB2 which I haven't played yet
Ok that's arid canyon act 2
hammer does master sword damage that the best you got
What was the pb on ngm?
whaddup, stream was good finished Mario Wonder
i did really enjoy it, very cute and fun game wolfyh2Pog
reminds me a lot of Kirby's Epic Yarn which is one of my favorites
did you do the level with the colored blocks along with the music
but i think it took me 5 or 6 tries??
in 10 years that level will be the only thing people remember the game for
unless it gets a DELUXE switch 2 port
i didn't hundred percent it, not sure if i will yet or not
Sonic would not be able to handle this dodongo, needs shadow the hedgehog to grind onto its back and attack its weak spot
LMAO THE DARK WORLD SOUND EFFECT
I didn't watch enough to notice before
swap the chicken sprite with the entire unscaled tails and plane one.
im going to be playing ttyd whenever those files LEAK
its sad that only nintendo games can make me play them on release nowadays
Heard aerial garden zone earlier and red volcano zone act 1
fun fact red volcano zone is only one act because they still haven't finished act 2 in SRB2's 20+ years of development
However they did finally upload the act 2 theme to their youtube channel 5 years ago
11 chests 2 keys drop and 1 boss for 14 checks
keys drops are vanilla for you
the seed been hot garbage combat wise
rando is clearly sentient and going out of its way to piss you off
oh the boss is four different sprites
my experience with alttp rando have all been bad too lmfao
This track is cavern fortress zone
do you think you could do a skyward sword rando catsittingverycomfortablecool idk if youve played it
skyward sword 🗡️ is to easy and ass at the same time no thrill
Ok that's enough SRB2 track name calling
I hear game audio and I don't think that's your intention rn unless you just want a quick start
Do you use ffile names in LTTP?
today I was looking at ways to tweek emerald seeds
I got my super cute commission today
I excluded all checks post champion plus safari zone and artisan cave
Is he doing the run today
that means only 9 out of 12 legends
And the mic isnt picking it up
oh metroid prime got ap release today
Yo Phantom, gl on runs today! phanto274GL
Fair, every time you open Twitter or any other platform it’s everywhere
My favourite is people not understanding that YEPSPIN
I am someone who doesn’t care too much about that stuff but I also fully understand why people don’t want to have that ruined for them. it’s the lake of understanding that kills me
it’s not hard to be considerate of people who don’t want to be spoiled
Yea I'm a bit mad about that
I saw that thread and was full phanto274Facepalm
All I know is the stupid 30fps 60fps discourse, muted Paper Mario because of that LMFAO
And it was always random chatters never seen before or since
Nah that shit happening in Monado's chat made me click off, like just enjoy the game LOL
Oh yea, still need to get everyone's timeslots for Speedtember, I posted the sheet not too long ago
Not sure if anyone else besides Rex has looked at it
Why didn't you say anything LMFAO
That boss looks horrible, just shit flying everywhere you can’t dodge
so you telling me he is not random
i always had trouble with him as a kid
i always get gloves then leave get red swords or i couldn't beat it
guess that why blue cane destroy him
it was ok - derusting from a break
i was tab out and heard bot nixirlKURUbonk
yo can you ban @sxh3dd @blacktiger51
Oh their message is still there lmao
try fighting him on ice its sucks
oh I thought this was rando oop mb lol
just play the gba version 4Head
I have two for four swords and uh. they’re probably a lot more than they were when I got them lmao
I got them before the bubble happened (thank god)
I saw og earthbound loose-cart at a con for like over a thousand dollars phanto274Smile
I still say this bubble is gonna pop soon
That sounds like a steal of a deal Kappa
wallet 🪪 was found turned into the police 👮 humanity is awesome 😎 once again! GL on things today.
doesn’t gba have a bunch of glitches too? I remember seeing that somewhere
Looking at some of your old bot quotes and I come across... PhantomGamesBot: The audio is slightyly desynced. Not sure if it doesn't matter for progression, but imagine having to do so Kappa . Those are the bot quotes we crave LUL Cheer100
also I heard you PB'd last night?
i have very little motivation to do my league races
Im finally doing my last round 1 today
the relicanth I was looking for last night, the log said it was in seafloor cavern strong current room with super rod. No idea how I was supposed to know that.
oh wait you still need tower KEKW
also each floor in magma base has different encounter tables so I may be expected to search each floor if it ever turns up there
if I really dont wanna deal with that stuff, I play on GBi so I could just tradee it ovver from my emerald cart LUL
Oncce I traded over a level 40 latios to deal with norman
i mean you hit the switch but...didn't go and kept switching it
"whats ur strategy for the mario party relay?" Me: My strategy isn't about being good. Its about being "Not As Bad" as the other 2 teams. LUL
i wanna play mario party :o
see i knew you could do it
damn so close to  1 4x xx
you said one on ganon twice
If you already have a filename for Link you can name epona Skittles if you want LUL
you already know my answer about a tp rando xD
Are you going to get the weird thing where a key item is locked behind that mini game or did you figure out that issue?
refund but givve me the points
I use that name for Yoshi in TTYD cause I never know what color ill get LUL
I wanna see you waggle around on camerra tho Kappa
you could play on emu then you should be able to bind it to a button
once you call epona you dont have to hop on her. You can just talk to Fado and the minigame will start
back from shower...kept thinking all day and the shower didn't help
I saw someone drop from up high, sword slash, and drop on the spinning platform only to fall off without getting the chest OMEGALUL
so can i ask everyone a deep question?
have you ever had days where you think to yourself..."who am i?"
not sure...i was gone in the beginning so idk where we going
i wonder if thats considered in logic
sometimes it would pop up in my head and be stuck there for a couple days
if only you equip megarush rn
imagine if rolling with iron boots could break rocks
i thought you were gonna do bomb bags then you ran right past it lol
I think your peeking your spoiler log LUL
who else does hotspring 20 minutes in?
wow you got a restored, powerful rod
i mean...you got the gut feeling
all you need is spinner for temple of time
TP be like. hey- did you forget how much a blue ruppee is worth? oh dw we’ll remind you
so I figured out why I fail that trick everytime
I was always L targeting lol
can sky characters still show up?
are golden bug spots randomized too?
cant wait for next version to remove bugs completely
imagine if a check was on all the bugs
how much for a all sanity tp rando Kappa
I own this version but my time was mostly spent on Wii and HD
is it just me or does wolf link climb ledges faster?
hey did you know that the heroes shade is actually-
phanbot is now a golden bug
can you imagine something on the 40 poe check and poes are randomized monkaW
so with 1 sky character, cannon does show until you get it?
spike and gym was doing practice today for it
i raided in and left so idk
and got hit with a adge as soon as i raided in KEKW
get too it reverie is good
My nightmare replays of cs 1 and 2 have been slow cause I'm distracted by like 1000 things
i wouldn't mind replaying them hmm maybe i should
I liked 1 pretty much as much as I did the first time except nord
Nord was still too big lol
Endgame was surprisingly really easy cause I knew what to abuse this time lmao
nord sucks everything else is great
Nord looks cool and I like the story for it
They just need to shrink that shit
yeah the story of it was good
At least I got the like 8x turbo lol
end game builds for trails are always broken af
Yea but then they forgot to make the last boss immune to delay lol
Is there a last boss harder than azure?
That one took me a hot minute on hard
but tio is op so it wasn't too bad
whats command for blitz race, I dont do it enough lol
gl on the race too btw!
im the same way when it comes to the term retro. Shovel Knight is retro cause it emulates something old. Ive adopted the term VintageGaming with vintage meaning over 20 years old.
so like the NES classic would be considered retro while SMB3 wouldnt cause it isnt new.
z targeting will auto make you ledge grab?
GL with rando, a race demands my attention now
last thing i remember was second clawshot and recovered rod
i see you didn't find the sword still xD
hey i'm telling you...risk it lolz
Cat was still a weapon of some kind LUL
speaking of master sword my master sword check in link to the past is my last swamp key AAAA
i already hate city...now i'm gonna hate it more xD
I hope everyone is doing well this evening
i hate city for the same reason everyone hates every zelda water temple
snowpeak...the area where you can't seem to get the bomb thing down
got buffalo wing sauce on my fingers so brb
didn't you say butter sword doesn't do damage vs the moth boss?
i just killed him with butter
maybe that a vanilla only thing
seeing wolf link try to squeeze through that gate reminds me of my dog trying to come from under the table
ah damn time for sleep...was looking forward to the stallord theme
Have I jumped the shark straight to old man territory if I’m making oatmeal as a snack after 8 pm? HmmCouncil
been lurkin for a while just was shhh cus was also in a call and playing they are billions (RTS with zombie horde mechanics in it)
fingers crossed then that you dont get 3 smalls ganon or double darknut ganon
I mean - you COULD but its risky PrideLaugh
no I mean the double darknut door
cus there's 2 chests behind that double darknut corridor
"please sleep with me in my bedroom, I'll make sure to stare at you with all my cold, red eyes"
link, shivering and not knowing what to say: *yes, ms freezard*
especially given how jank it is to get ooccoo up there
like - I know you can get ooccoo up there, but it always feels wrong to go into the CitS shop
I wonder btw: couldnt in theory the double capacity bomb bag be made the last prog bomb bag if one were to make them be prog?
I know why its currently not done given separate GI's most likely
but like... it just feels odd when you get dunked by that
yes it most of the time dont matter PrideLaugh
like how it normally dont matter in windwaker either
but for items which dont have that super split windwaker has on bows v quivers, it (to me, might be niche can live with) feels weird to also have it be applied to WW there
well - bomb bags rather, but you knw
just that silly brain me preferring a prog item option in a reasonable way
combat tool and water bombs ye
an to be fair to both TP and WW, the check pools rn also arent suuuuper big
Is this the quickest final Ganon?
damn that was quick last phase
@Bringus_ majoras mask is bc he isnt there HAHAHHAHAHAHAH
oot take 7 hits iirc that pretty fast
woah is that the twilight princess?
gotta say the white hair and purple hood is one of the better  random color schemes
i am hype for Friday to watch you plsy ttyd
My bottle of Malort has claimed numerous victims, and were only Day 1 into ComboBreaker
dude what time is it for you to even get mickyds breakfast?!?!
have you already started a playthrough?
He took the bottle of his own volition
I cant pin on mobile can you pin that buff00n message
im going on a trip tomorrow to bgdq so ill watch you while driving (i wont be the one driving)
counting on all star piece locations LUL
I think I found a new one but not entirely sure
i have no idea haven't seen shit for this game beside what you posted
I stopped playing last night once I got to great tree
like can you blame me KEKW
your cat chucky has the look of murder in his eyes
its so weird to see a new game with toadsworth lol
making the speedrun longer already KEKW
the fact that he admits he doesn't have a pure heart and she still talks to him
OMG the pape 64 remix that you can barely hear
thousands of doors looks so pretty
the box holds the save block atoms in place
the new ost is kinda hype ngl
did mario have a jumping voice on gamecube?
what did you do to that innocent bomb?? xD
one day we can do that to goombario LOL
aw you gotta add some character lolz
action commands were so free for me
are you using a pro controller?
ttyd is so good for letting you use action commands right at the start of the game
Are you planning on trying glitches?
Gotcha. I am currently in chapter 3 and can confirm you find fright masks before it
i wonder if any old glitches works
making me nauseous. imagine if this had a VR version
The dialog speed pain me so much
Also help a ghost just kissed mario
OMG it's the thing paper Mario does in the Mario and luigi paper jam game
Wait do you have your rumble on strong
Too hot for dog walking papeHands
yeah i just came back from the mailbox with that conclusion
other day I got a hype train emote and its quickly becoming my top 10 GimmeDat
it has so many applications LUL
i wouldnt be surprised if they added a panel there
oh THATS where i got the word tootsies from omg
the way blooper talks reminds me of elementman
its sticker star leaking into ttyd KEKW
she's just calling that blooper gross and slimy like dude
she didn't have to go that far...i mean mario did step on his leg
the way mario looked straight up reminded me of snoopy LUL
just pretend its a shadow not a reflection
yup, its been a whole 20 years LUL
you know what she said..you read it xD
it would be funny if this room had all the different peach art styles. Like SMB, SMW MS64, paper, and modern LUL
was that in the gamecube version
damn so close to sub 130
she's so mean in this one xD
i remember her being nicer in the original lolz
I did every option fight and got an extra level just before hooktail
she was sassy not a smartass
were some bad frame rate issues
Who called quiz? Who called quiz!? Its quiz time!! Come on and do it! Ha-cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Cheer100
this fight really shows off what the switch can do KEKW
can you check something in petalburg?
i step away for 2 mins and a bot come in KEKW
blacktiger needs to tighten up LUL
go ask koopie to join you LU
oh yeah the hp blocks cost money in this game
I learned a thing today. On GBA everrdrive you can swap A and B
I bought a $19 powerA gamecube style controller just for this game LUL
I love Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. It is a paper CUT above the rest. LUL
oh i'm back in time for the shower scene!
so i was told that back then...a scene like this would be considered intimate
bowser looks so weird facing forward
those things were always adorable :3
phantommmmm why is ur 2 backwards
WOW 3 min of ads brb
it would suck if bad rng made you reset KEKW
dont you have a higher chance the longer you wait?
did you visit the other badge shop?
so it doesnt need chapter clears?
he wants you to buy slowgo
What are you trying to get? One of the man badges?
damn I didn't know you could get it that early
how much is it on gcn?
the wiki says its only 60 in the gamecube version
w emblem was 360 in gamecube version
how much does gamecube badge sell for?
I'm sure someone will find something
what is different with repel cape and boo sheet
press A to enter pipes is weird
so the old shortcut pipes are gone?
i wonder what happened if you get a star out of order then get a older 1
I cant wait for glitz pit
I love when I spent inverted square something on something KEKW
I mean - its their theme alright
just saw a really funny mario party 4 clip, waluigi wins 30 coins from lottery and on verry next turn wario wins 100 coins from same lottery KEKW
Are you 100% or just beating game
its the most adorable creatures in this game...the punies!
yea the plane is beefed up since gamecube
I mean - ch3 gives you repeatable power rushes
i forgot this is a stream and not youtube
but yea like - I know you ant reasonably get power rushes consistently til post ch5, IF you dont know how to goombella buffer to get to ch5 early for unlocking ms mowz
or just having a way back / forth at ch5
whats the middle one of the shadow trio called
Wait wait wait.. am i an idiot, Or Did it change from Shadow beauties (to be corrected as Shadow Sirens) or...?
I know they tried to attribute to more accurate localization and all, But that threw me off SOOO bad lol
1 less health on her madcap4Think
or am I imagining that she had 10 in OG?
yea they are definitely nerfed in health
I dunno man I think Flurrie blows
Well to be fair he was always lackilester
Are you gonna 100% the game ?
How dumb is it that I want to buy a 3rd copy of the game so I can keep playing instead of letting my kids play. Plus I want this to sell well.
I'll take the chuckle as meaning very dumb
Where did you find power jump?
might sound specist but uh...why do they all look the same except for those 2 punies xD
are you ready to speed run this Kappa
just that the odds of it working in later chapters were abysmal
you left some punnies behind bro
yea here you dont rly get that skill bonus I dont think KEKW
you just get lucky or you dont given how easy the command is
also if available, bobbery / vivian or hell, koopio are each in their ways better PrideLaugh
and punio wasnt seen again for the toilet was occupied for the rest of the day
wasnt the issue basically just boiling down to the fact that chapter flags dont give you the crystal stars even if you were to chapter hop?
cus of goombella buffering I mean
yeaaa you gotta fight these I feel like
you have to fight them i guess
even if you could stun them I feel like it wouldnt help much on the front of getting the punies through
I don't know how I feel about some of these remixed tracks
cus they get alerted way earlier then they ever did i nOG too
I don't know why they made it A
I like the qol they added but
Eh this feels slow for other reasons
ttyd as speed game I think the big run wasnt even any% or hundo but rather pre hooktail pit, no?
hope you don't mind me taking a nap here rn
Come to think about it bosses were the only things that didn't give you coins for beating them before
I mean - you could just do super boots power bounces without any setups on him and always do 1 regardless of his defense afaik
sooo my guess is von grapple just is not 100% consistent on its damage calcs
aww he isnt running into the fort endlessly anymore
OK so there is 1-2 frames in between loading zone transitions swifS
I swear to fuck if lzs is a thing
I mean - unless they changed much, goombella buffering should also still function, no?
It's either 1 or 2 frames can't quite see, but I did notice some frames
and thats not even really a thing you should be able to patch
Not even doing the effort of a message KEKW
You can't even move with the analog stick while unspinning?
so speedrunning-wise this is TTYD No Fun Allowed Edition
Don Pianta deserved a better voice lolz
That's one way to give a blessing
If I have kids I'll make sure to tell them to fuck off and get married in the future
You know where power bounce is btw?
Well I have to go there anyways KEKW
Same as rowf? 2 loading zones?
Well he is kinda kooper so
Who is your fav on TTYD?
By finish the game do you intend hundo percent?
guessing you doing pit after you beat the game
KEKW got a fb message from live cams girl nice spam
Mario's nose has its own area code.
Bro's a fusion speaking wise between triple H and Hogan
I flew through this chapter in my original playthrough.
Idk but I feel like it's a dojo more than ring
Someone needs to dub this guy like Foghorn LEghorn.
mario is anything but skinny lolz
son- I say son- You gots to wrestle- i Say listen boy- wrestle yer way to the top!
Dunno but I was grateful for that hot dog
dude was eating his lunch there
Grubba Dimmadome, owner of the Glitzville Dimmadome
Glitz ville home to the glizzy guzzler
Kids today wouldn't even recognize that as anything other than a computer tuerminal.
Yep they didn't hold back on that one
I beggin' of her not to shroom my man.
gave my uncle a GBA for his bday with super mario world...he fucking loved it
Left you a new thing in dms just in case Nintendo ninjas and whatever
I'm gonna BOMB oh fuck BOMB I can't BOMB
But too bad im following anothers journey of this
All I can say is glad i have my identity intact. I am also happy u had my back.
is this where the timer starts?
How much time has passed with the Yoshi color?
I'm loving how much more sass they gave Goombella
Yeah was hoping for black too
I'll swallow the opponent whole as adult is different
Yo, hope the games been enjoyable so far!
Imagine being over 60 and in shape, impossible
ok how tf is yoshi green you wasted how much time
past 20 or rushed below 7
so the first is more feasible
bs i say...was really thinking it'd be orange
Also, the pipe to glitzville might be my favorite add
that throat gotta put up some work in him
i was told you can just try to use the door and the guard will come instantly btw
oh don't worry they fixed it so mario flips them off instead
close fight but you eke'd it out
I’ve been sweating this whole pit
you loving the fast text too? ha ha ha (in pain)
im considering literally not even buying it
What have been your pros and cons so far Phantom?
love that they even made paper mode not shrink your y-hitbox any more
so the fast riddle tower is no more for sure
the real trick is gonna be whether or not TRE can be found
that will determine if runs exist or not basically
oh fuck yeah Punies still bad
if you cant punie jump youll have to kill the pider on the 2-floor room too
coins from boss fights seems sick
at least a lot of the animations being able to be skipped is nice
you can skip partner upgrade animaton after the first one too
there seems to be some nice stuff, but the text alone is a gigantic red flag
apparently people are making mods for faster text or trying to at least
nothing is gonna be allowed for lb
TTYD is p archaic about stuff
What in the hell.. The bot... My brain
low key i'd have to play with volume way down, the "voice" noise drives me nuts
What do you have equipped? Mega and power rush?
wait did these guys just show up randomly at rank 7?!
he lost the fp too lol
we lost a life shroom, a point swap, and a gradual syrup
for a total gain of -1 rank
you will look at the blinking upgrade and you will LIKE IT
this level up costed me blue yoshi
craw harder daddy - said the furry
"you're an idiot" fuck man...probably didn't want the cake yet
howdy y'all gerbieWave can't believe how awesome this game seems to be
I assume you played the OG? which was your favorite chapter?
yea, 3 was great, but by now its kinda a slog. Think I still like chapter 6 the best myself
ch5 is the best in both games yes
it really is, I just really like the vibe
6 is awesome your first time casually
i do really like 5 in both games
once you play a couple times, 6 falls apart real hard
actually 7 would probably be the best if it wasn't for general white lol and maybe the regular moon
man was born yesterday and is already after it
pretty wild seeing the back of yer partner's heads
No shit I thought he threw balloons
rawk is the easiest fight to get peril on at least
yeah, he does 3 per hit
I was wondering if they'd keep the GBA here
Guards always remind me of the finger gun gaurds from Yugioh
Nice tip is to hammer to the edge, stops and just Mario stumbles
Specially for yoshi the dumb mf
Johto rocket grunt reference StareArrive hyuck hyuck hyuck
Ayo we found the roids abuser
Next thing he's gonna talk like Schwarzenegger
Oh one thing btw, grubba and his more chanced and shit got fixed
Didn't watch that Bowser fight closely enough
It's no longer animé protagonist bs where grubba beats the shit outta you KEKW
She whipped her cock out monkaS
He looks fat more than buffed
"well you heard her mario, grab it." TTYD quotes out of context go hard
r u sure you 100%ing this tonight
What's your time limit for this?
Then you probably can hundo but barely
Meh, hundo is very subjective as shit
I love how much more expressive they made the elder
Sleep time. Good night guys! GL with the hundo Phan
Fuck I need to return to this room
I never realized how similar those spikes are to the Tubba’s castle room until now
I'm sure the stache can hide well as a bride
why did he write on your butt
i might go to sleep after 5 its midnight almost
smh let us unsubscribe at least
that animation does look a lot better
started a new file on fire red, and saw on my everdrive I have an event distro for espeon and umbreon so I sent them over. They are both level 70 so I cant use them phanto274Smile
I took a level 10 mew and a random egg at least
is this a new feature or was this boo quiz always there?
oh neat. you can use items instead of throwing them out
I’m trying to remember, what’s the big difference between boo sheets and repels?
I think boo's sheets are also 2 turns, just like repel gels
Okay, I remembered there were no gels but I also couldn’t remember if the sheets were diff since you can buy them
right I forgot about that too
hey it’s that guy from Pape Rando!
Dark Mario is best plz clip this
yeah I have no idea why they wouldn’t use this for Yoshi
Or the file select they stole from us Sadge
Thank god we keep the climate birds
not losing coins is huge for how many tight encounters
i was waiting for you to get to that part
I'm working a security shift that pays $40 an hour (instead of $80 for one shift), so I will be doing my damnedest to stay awake as long as possible
he hid his pirate booty, you say Kappa
i quite like this remake. it's not perfect, but i'm enjoying it so far
i don't want to tickle your nostrils, flavio
a lot of people really wanted a playable paper luigi story, and i knew that wasn't gonna happen
if we're lucky, they'll make a separate game for that
gamechanging in the glitchless category right now
yeah its 2 am Bedge i wanted to see the best chapter but too tired
Is there a feeling fine type badge? Because I will need it here
Where did we find ice power? The shop?
Dayum you're closing up on me
That and you did peril strats Susge
nice u playing the new one
tell mvd i said hii of he there
ph yeah u retired like me lol
I hate serving tables it’s so stress. thx for streaming this today 💜 something to relax to after work
still getting used to TEC being red instead of blue
Phantom I found out something interesting
You can pick up items by hammering
are you chugging as many energy drink as I am?
I'm trying to stick out to at least 6pm CST
(Sunny in Philadelphia music) "The Delfino Mobsters Owes Mario Mario A Favor"
your stream made me sleep what did i miss 😶
i was when u save those punis
btw who's the purple toad ?
120 star hard but stream was good ty
yeah i saw thats why i figured we'd raid!
was gonna say you gotta have made a dent reddLul
anything of note you didnt expect but enjoyed?
technically my name does come from feliz
But still it's an autocorrect that I fucking hate sometimes
how far into the game are you now
6 and 7 are really short if you already know what to do
yo phantom how goes the run of ttyd
oh neato, so your telling me i got vods to watch later
well it's relaxin listening to your vods of stuff. Also that's alot of memory
So, smorg is as much of a glass cannon as I remember KEKW
Yeah that shit kills it 100%
Is chapter 7 long? I don't remember aside from the party finding
Well I guess the game really is long up until chapter 4, because all have felt somewhat faster
No punies no back and forth, the witch is not dead but is part of the 3 bitches, etc etc
Now that kid is me as a kid
Gonna guess og you just go and it completes?
Only one I know who runs it is monado so uh, yeah, short enough of a list to know if it's even worth running KEKW
i tried learning it once but
the shreer length of that run
i only run good glitchless categories
OK if feli doesn't like it that says a lot
it would be good if there wasnt a ton of rng lmfao
whens just skipping chapter 3 in glitchless
think this remake will make glitchless better?
do you have to go left and right on them?
what is that pause after you go down a ledge
yeah i don't remember him being slowed at all going down stairs?
PHANTOMMM STOP IT WITH THE BACKWARDS NUMBERS   its triggering meee
why does ur timer keep bullieing me
so whatas  O_o 0 : (star) 5 : 1/26 0 mean then
im taking a L   with ur timer
will u be speedrunning  this ehen a route gets made
ok im giving up with ur timer
lol his light is red now, pretty sure it was green before
really needed to replace that motherboard anyway
i think ur timer is more vroken then tec
And then the ending and then post-credittt
yo glhf not ending stream until game complete!
yeah was just continuing my casual playthrough of this, just about to start ch4
(on that note I'll prob be mostly tabbed out lol) Yeah it's been fun! Sluggishness is unfortunate but for casual it's only a minor complaint from me
how’s the staying up adventure going
you sound like you have energy lmao
so does strange sack give 25 or 30? since normal gives 15
I don’t think I could stay still that long without losing my mind
yes! its lovely, just gotta get some shut eye now
I'm curious how you are able to do so much damage with multi jumo
I know its with like power rush
and what was the other one pdow?
not sure where I could get more power rush
cause I have like 4 clsoe calls lol
got 2 before the chapter 1 boss
where is the place to change the hearts?
I keep getting myself lost in Rougeport xD
sometimes I keep forgetting some of these stuff but remember the hard parts lol
2 amazy dazzy I'm so shock tbh
I'm still shock about the 2 amazy dazee lol
Movers really said: get these cuts son lol
anyway I was lucky to find my amazy dazzee super early in Twilight
casually leveling up after basically every fight
wait is there a level cap in this game?
Damn you weren't kidding, 17 hours
good thing I'm almost done with  chapter 5 soon
goombario wishes he was as usefull
I gotta do the pits now lol
She'll be back when they remake it again in 20 years
It's almost 8 where I am
Rain has left for work, the doggo has been fed, and there are no unnecessary dishes to be cleaned. So I can go back to bed evo17Banzai
wow I just did multijump on Cortez' weapons
it really got me tripped up but just hearing audio cue just made me auto pilote
I said I can. Doesn't mean I will yet btw lolz
also the world pipe for the switch is huge tbh
They're really trying to push it lolz
chat's popping this early in the morning, holy moly
hello streamer, i believe your timer is broken
ah yes 1 and a backwards half hours in
I mean he is a kid ya know. Supposed he could carry mario though
kids these days won’t know the struggle of this quest
wait wasn't there only 4 pipes before for shortcuts?
Best way to remember something...saying out loud
i heard there were a new boss in chatper 3
the switch is a very powerful console
now the question is: how do they breathe in space?
they cant breath in space in super paper mario
that's cuz it's a different dimension. Different rules
Goombella sounds like an Undertale / Deltarune character
this isnt japan its the moon
Japan made the game right? I mean... drive on left side
just realize what peach part I have to do I'm gonna lose it lol
not 5 in the morning doing this crappy [each section lol
never understood why they made this one unique
finally finished the peach potion wow I don't like timing right now espically 5:30 in the dame morning lol
I remember this fight...made me angry
so what weapons to be careful of again? lol
so to get more power rush is after finishing chapter 6?
Though I wish to see goth peach...I also need sleep
I'll just play this in the background
Well so...I'm epileptic. Being up early is bad for me
its a huge ass building lol
well now you have to level up something else woweeTOS
any idea if palace skip was patched in this game yet
How long have you been live?
they changed it from beyond beyond beyond, before before woweePause
is that the thing that skips the shadow siren fight
wow my brain is shutting down
I was finally trying to remember to buy life shrooms lmao
wtf you can get more than 999 coins woweePause
idk what's worst doing the 100 pits or having to hear the pianta couple and say I love you 100 times lol
is this ur 1st time playing?
this my fav game i'll get the remake some other time thougj
oh snap just realized ur doing 5 hp run gl
it wasn't hand it was just black clouds tbh
alright lets not break her too fast lol
finally... about to start chapter 6
should i buy this game catsittingverycomfortable
i mean i have the gc game soooo
what the omega is the timer doin
are we doing the supposed bonus postgame fights
apparently they added some, no idea what tho
the original didn't have any idt
Is shadow queen still a bitch?
Just to know if I should grind a bit more lmao
Cortez is way up there in my fav characters
Yeah the text kills the pace a lot
If that was untouched from og it would've been more appreciated
It's fun for casual and challenges because it's still pretty
But for speedrunning fuck no it'll take forever
Can I see your mail real quick?
And yeah the glitz pit has some stuff
No I just thought whacka set something in post-game lol
But if you wanna smack the fuck out of him be my guest
idk where the post-game whacka stuff is apparently
wait, you can just get every tattle from the bin? like, why even tattle in the first place during battle lol
I know what the content is, I just don't know why you're not getting the mail for it
Did you talk to frankly yet?
OK that might be something to do if this doesn't give anything
OK then yup, you need to clear more troubles
I can dm you what it is if you just don't care enough lol
It's all I can think of
The other one is clearing glizzy ville again and I know you won't do it
Yeah if it was no conditions it'd be so much better
Yeah go in, aoe, gg, aoe so on and so forth
OK the mail should be sent soon
I wonder if rougeport is the other flag
Oh I do have 2 troubles for the other post game
Help wanted and I must have that boob
Thanks keyboard I hate you too, book
The only requirement for it is post chapter 6 state
I hate that people aren't still clear on this
They've had the game for 3 weeks come on
Am u seeing it right 21 hours? mfpOoo
So u did beat it at least
Also the toodles one looks like it's the one
They should be readily available tbh this shit sucks
Jesus this mf took his whole laundry there
Yeah I know your pain it should be changed to go to the counter for the reward
What are you trying to do
Trying to find a fucking flag for post-game
Did you do the one here?
You also have to do the 100 pit too
The Wrack a mole in ch5 pops up in the pit after you beat Bonetail
Need the mail for it to pop up
And thanks for the spoiler I was avoiding although it was obvious
Both of which will take time if he's trying to sleep soon 😴
The Glitz one isn't too bad
You get to lvl 50 now
??? Why they make it so easy now
What I don't know is why you're not getting that fucking mail
I don't blame ya cuz ya doing this again is a drag
Its a very cool fight though
It should be unlocked period then lol
Like how the Master is in Dojo on regular paper
damn they really revamped the music HERE more than other places Hmm
Go do it without a chore of things to do
I mean you were already one when you left so it's crazy you're at the bottom
Check your mail again and see if the pit one was sent somehow some way?
Must be on a timer or loading zone counter
I don't see anything about it
Because he did every thing else
If you're locked out of it because you're in post-game when you did it it's just shit designing
Nah you need to do it twice still
Because he beat trials before ch 7
That's crazy he would have beat Trials twice because he didn't do it in post
That's a silly technical to go through Pit of 100 at post
No it's not at post it'd be dumb as shit
I fucking hate early stuff because they don't explain for shit
Not a mod but im here
Yeah, probably not the best speed game...
At least it's not constant mashing Clueless
hear me out. chip n dale rescue rangers
What kind of game(s) you interested in running?
what about the power rangers movie tie in game?
I do love some 3D Marios, would be happy to see any of them on this channel
i mean links awakening could work
You did also move ALttP from what you posted in the mod chat, is that just a simple swap or did you have something else planned?
oh man. i know 64 games are tough but yoshis story would be quick to learn?
I got a mini heart attack seeing the title but not seeing the game
Will get to TTYD as soon as one of my siblings buy it
I finished TTYD yesterday after never playing OG
Yoshis story is a cute game
Bro just hamtaro until your eyes bleed
I just bought my wife a hamtaro ham hams unite game. Gotta change the battery though
Could be a place to start, just not any% lmao
any shot youd do zelda oot randos?
If phantom does oot I'm outta here
I mean unless you're zfg, yeah
well you could do the partners games
I wouldnt recommend OoT just because of how SUUUUPER rough that could be on the community building side
Jon we come from fucked up communities, we're used to it
you know EXACTLY what I am referring to though pichu KEKW
eff it speed run destiny 2
Meh whatever jon, phantom wouldn't care enough for that kinda shit
i was gonna say. mickeys magical quest games?
There's a jak port that's legal
Want me to search into it? Think it's jak 3
what about the soul reaver series? im just spewing titles at this point
did they make jak pc ports? o.O
why did I never hear of that PrideLaugh
thats a series i wish would make a come back
I have my ps3 with rac 1-3 and I still don't wanna do it solely because they don't do loadless
And I won't install an ssd on my ps3 lmao
Can be another sonic game regardless KEKW
Hey sonic 06 is a cool run
sonic 06 was the first xbox 360 game i ever beat
17 year old me is still pissed
Meh for me it was whatever
Considering how much of a pain in the ass the mods were about playing it it's probably good
Fuck it, mm, pc port released
Being real, who cares if we wanna watch. Cards on the table if you werent doing content what would you do?
I also find it like, why
I heard BK's "100% Furnace Fun Moves" category is pretty neat, but brutal in mistakes bleeding time
oh man... perfect game. Yo Noid!
I dont actually know. why do you hate ttyd?
Oh yeah! back on my top 3 zelda today
Yeah I think it is lol
been hear lurking friends making me play destiny 2  no sound
I heard of a couple minor skips in ch2
The only sequence break I've seen so far is that one punie key one, and that only skips a few mins
wasnt it some note you had to read to set flags for the TRE to work?
or did people also already see that the flags work diff?
The devs must've done their research on ttyd speedruns, it's too well patched up on the critical places
Saw something about a water switch skip working like in OG
Speed tech probably dead but at least anyone dedicated enough to run it won't ruin their hands
Maybe they'll pull a Metroid Dread and change their minds on the turbo
Who are "the mods" anyway if no speedrun scene develops because the game is butts to speedrun
Oh right, these guys sure earned their position on the remake
... really? Is that an SRC thing or just that runners of the old games are the first to grab a remake mod position?
If it becomes a problem that mods don't care, a request can be made to SRC to at least add new mods
I haven't looked recently but I'd imagine if a top runner complained and none of the mods were active runners, something might happen
nice. I haven't decided whether or not I want to pick it up
well that's nice. Not helpful for a speedrun though
does the game have sped up text on replays?
Yeah, I noticed that on the tattles. On the second time mashing through it is so fast
because casually, the text/writing is a core feature
so you would want to spotlight that
They must've added a flag to every single piece of repeatable text, kind of crazy
you think they would have gotten tired of it themselves during testing
@ImPurpp they probably did, but that's the job of manual game testers. They knew what they signed up for...probably
what if (outside of speedruns) a "fast text" option gets patched in via an update at some point given replays have always been the one weakspot of TTYD
when was the last time a Nintendo-developed title (read, not Mercury Steam/Retro/etc) patched something to make games more speedrun friendly?
power bounce frame timings are wild
4th bounce suddenly being a 1framer
@janitorbeav I am not thinkin speedrun-friendly with fast text
guess they noticed how op power bounce was
@janitorbeav They improved loads in BotW/SMO :)
cus fuck slow text, makes me replay a game less
8th bounce also is tight AF
dont matter the specifics, heard stuff from 9 7 5 1 to 7 7 5 1
tldr: 4th bounce is frame perfect
and 8th also is for some reason
Not that that would be a great idea, but I wonder how the Simplifier badge plays into PB
@MarioManTAW fair. I left out the part where I meant a change specifically targeted for speedruns being easier/better, outside of general performance changes
anyhow it doesnt matter on the 4th / 8th
and like - ttyd doesnt NEED power bounce to be ridiculusly chainable given how danger is accessible
and in any% you would then route in whackas with the now 15 items, stock up on cash in the train and do the trouble for damage in ch7/8
yuhh sounds awfully bug like then, I feel thats something they'd patch
like - danger mario still is potent AF despite that, but like - its weird to make it a sudden 1framer
just let the timing be consistent and be done with it
@janitorbeav Yeah, not intentional but SMO load times did make current version the fastest, making it more accessible. Other than that, uh...
is how TEDIOUS the testing must have been to get power bounce to be how it is now
I tried ToTK for a little while and kinda threw my hands up
Fair, SMO would also be super annoying if it had to be run in a middle version
because like - you also gotta confirm it going to end on 9th, meaning you would HAVE to run into the timing tests for the other bounces
it was the same with Dread
and there it's like, "oh you got the physical version? Too bad."
do you have to walk all the way around the priest? I thought you could squeeze in between
A good leaderboard would have them split if the difference was that significant
k me go lurky more - time to fuck up my Fallout 4 savefile a bit PrideLaugh
tldr: fallout 4 has a settlement building feature, but some just restrict you unnecessarily without any real reason to it
you can sort by physical/digital, and there was a split for 1.0.2 which removed axis skew (?) I don't remember the specific trick
and given its a bethesda game (bought it like 6 years ago or so) its bound to be jank once I do that KEKW
I'm glad I played Fallout 4 on PC so I could have access to the console. I got autosaved in an elevator at the top of a building and the next time it loaded, it loaded me before the floor and I'd always fall to my death
my reason to turn auto quick saves off entirely
a) bethesda games with autosaving have a weird memory corruption / piling issue anyway, and b) they do shit like that
I truly wish autosaves wouldnt be so prone to do stupid shit
big part has to be that no one ever figured out proper anti-autosave areas
alright well I'm out to start making food
one thingg to the changes to games these days: I do get wanting a game to be like a well rounded, tasty meal if that makes sense - but replays should be part of consideration on game design on things which could feel tedious to play through again (so text options in games heavy on text as an example, backtracking cut outs where it makes sense to do it
and yes ik this is a wall of text
like - aside of games people love to replay for them being loved games, a somewhat decent bit at times can also be the fact that certain things can be done more conveniently
once you played through it to all treasures collected, any non treasure cutscene becomes skippable
and in parts (again, pikmin 2) I get it with say the treasure cutscenes because "you just got something, fanfare WOOO" and such
I would even take casual 30 hours for run through / 60 to completion if I can get convenience options in regards to making the run through quicker once I know whats going on
not every game has to be a cinematic master piece
this worm got some dodges right now HOOOLY
Sounds like your having the day I am 🥴 phone crapped itself yesterday tv crapped itself today just waiting for my PC to go nope tomorrow now 🤦🏻‍♀️
I can't believe I missed ttyd run Sadge
i guess thats a valid complaint.
PaperMario made u jcog and morph famous though. so silverlining i suppose
I've basically not slept this whole weekend
it'll be amazing whenever I get my money n
so i herd there's a new skip
that seemed both normal and legit, no notes
did you patch in the mario 3 whistle sound? ive never played minish cap
never even had a clue it was a thing
"Playing an actually good 2d zelda"
I should've just said Minish Crap
did you do all the side stuff in ttyd?
ice beat the gamecube version right
maybe only the trouble that give you Ms. Mowz should be req for 100%
Doesn't matter that I beat the gc version
There's lots of QoL i'm avoiding
Because I want to experience it on my own
i wasn't gonna say shit about the remake
Which is why I want to avoid spoilers if I can
I mean SMRPG doesn't have shit
Except a skip that saves 20s
Submit your full playthrough on stream as a glitchless run phanto274Smile
Can't wait for 0 GDQ submissions of it cause it's too long
Nah if it's over 4 hours, it's absolutely not going to happen anymore
They haven't accepted a 5 hour+ run in like a few years
AGDQ 2023 had FF7 no slots by Zheal which was sub 7
But that was an online event
Before that, it was AGDQ 2020, with FF8
I'm still gonna decide if I wanna run it after I start and finish my casual playthrough
Power Bounce got nerfed bad lmfao
Just hit the 1 frame window 4Head
What was the max you could possibly get in OG?
From what I remember, the soft cap is basically a 2/3rd chance you drop bounce even with a successful input
Where can I see that data?
Glans tweet popped the fuck off
Just gotta get 100 so you can get the Super Suit
Super guard feels free in the first 3 chapters
There were very few I've missed
I do wish we could turn off voices too
You doing the big city skip?
The boss key cool I like seeing that one lol
Glad you did miss that check LUL
is a blue korok a cold korok or a smurf?
If a Zora and a Goron have a baby is it a Zoron?
Coro made out like a bandit
so a goron is superior to a zora?
I do feel alot better now but still not 100%
cant wait for the ss/tp/ww combo rando
When is bomberman X castlevania Konami combo rando
I thought you did plum after chickens
Ice when are you doing TP rando LUL
Played this game once, beat it, don't plan on playing it again
I find it interesting if I get spinner early I barely use wolf
I thought about asking komari just so he could tell you to run #birdup
I've seen this a few times with wolf link
I heard ttyd HD is quickest in chinese
Why do you think they didn't speed up opening ook's door?
It does play 3 cutscenes, wonder if that's an issue
Have to wait til noon for the kid
Feel when family texts you a Facebook link, I treat that shit like spam lol
That "could" be a silver ruppee Kappa
it seems like every time i jump in...it's always kakariko village
gotta get contacts first so i can wear my masquerade masks
Axl is a stinky MMBN runner
Alot of stuff I do overlaps with phantom lol
I'm totally kidding cause I run MMBN2 as well lmao
Megaman is cool but battle network is cringe
BN is better than main series
Tp mp favorite  zelda game nice
I should go back to that game for a mid 3x
Mm9 is the only classic game I've loved enough to beat without savestates
I'm gonna get Phantom to like Zelda 2 I swear to god
You know what Minish cap doesn't have?
i think i'm tied between MM and TP
I mean remember your Minish Cap run? LUL
the one thing i hated about OoT...Volvagia
Did I ever tell you how I softlocked to Volvagia?
well no i lied...Vol and then Dark Link
For me if LBW didn't happen ST would be my favorite top down
Yeah who knew hitting Volvagia's hitbox after the death animation starts
Caused Volvagia to .... revive and dive, and never move again
Switched to phone for few seconds ahead rather than behind
Mobile is dying so good luck with rando
For some reason...my laptop is behind like 5ish seconds
Axl meant their phone is dying...
And yet nobody believes he can kick ass against his other "adult" selves
You see him wrestle his fatass mayor?
I have returned! I got 4 lolz
I used my computer today and it didn't nope it thank god. Still waiting for some sort of electronic to shit itself tho
The Goron left his rod for you
Where can I see what I can redeem the point things on again?
Where's redemptions? I lost everything 😭
Ugh I don't even have discord on phone now either
Thanks @iceblue but I can't see anything
Iron Boots 4th check in CitS
Sadge still waiting for pit runs to be added to redemptions
But streamer I does want the pit runs Madge
Damn 5th check was actually an item
Sorry i had to go really bad
Was wondering what that was about
is link wearing an apron maid outfit?
And add them to your boots
You gotta blast into the large gaping hole??
Last time you almost "didn't bother"...it was the spinner you were looking for
Shit I just got played lolz
if I had a nickel for every time I saw you I get spinner right as I join, I’d have $0.20
which isn’t a lot but it’s weird how it keeps happening
When your friend says they'll hold onto the money for you
Coulda paid for Fogo with all that extra money...
Wish we lived in zelda world...we just walk around finding money
phtantoommm whats comfy about tp rando
@darkapplequeen can I call you Queen A?
Phantom: When you don't have money.... fuck
was pondering continuing tears of kingdom but saw this stream xD
Bird didn't need to push you
i hope they can make a new zelda that works like the old ones
I thought shigeru decided to stop the zelda games
i don't remember this fight lmao
to me definitively is no boomerang no hookshot no zelda.
but totk bounced this game right here off its 5th spot.
ocarina of time, best zelda game frfr
Oh look it's the fight I just spent 20 mins doing because I didn't know wooden sword didn't work YEP
I was like "hm not on my tracker, weird oh well!"
Are there other bosses wooden sword doesn't work on?
I was one of the lucky ones. Phantom told me wooden sword didnt work before I rolled my first city in the sky LUL
I just assumed wooden sword was that bad that maybe it took like 15 hits
Mega man X is better! Bye ice
They told me the doctor that did my extractions doesn't work there anymore
And the only doctor they have only works Monday and Wednesday
I was like, why do you have a part time DOCTOR employed only?
Going in tomorrow for a consultation to see if my wisdoms are too close to my nerves
If they aren't then he can do it, if they aren't they gotta refer me somewhere else
If I can't get these wisdoms out soon, I'm gonna jump off a cliff or something
She told me, the doctor has to do a consultation, and probably can't even extract them till Monday
I told the lady on the phone, sweet, I guess I'll just eat this bottle of ibuprofen
I hope everything will turn out okay though
Phan doesn't like his viewers lolz
I'd say I agree, but they willingly stay in a hotel room with me at GDQs for 9 days
So I think there's some kind of friendship there
so you just need boots and master sword?
I wish I could go to GDQ one day
If you're able to attend one day, you should totally do so
yeah, I do recommend going to GDQ at least once
So that sounds fake to me
I just got lucky with the location
Yeah I went to that one
I did commentary for Link's Awakening with TGH and Amber
not even an hours drive, I drove back and forth every day LUL
Yeah cause I talked you into going LUL
to be fair, I didnt even know Jcog then
in less then 5 hours i will be a old man  monkaW
Dude I'm gonna pass back out again
God I can't wait for this GDQ
Goddammit Ice now I want food xD
Oh did I tell you I applied for Safety Coordinator?
beep won't be at this GDQ unfortunately
Apply next time, I can let beep know that you're able
I literally walk around for an hour, check the arcade, talked to people in the board game room
Then sat by the stream room door for an hour
Apparently there's gonna be a GDQ escape room at this venue
They posted a full activities list
There's no Taiko, so I stopped looking
Yeah the arcade is fully listed
"Brought to GDQ by Think Quick Events, we will have an on-site escape room! Stay tuned for more info."
Yeah I'm hyped. I do an escape room every GDQ with Keizaron and a few others
So it'll be cool to do more lmao
Oh so my friend told me that he's 95% sure I made it to round 2 of the interview for the WFH job
Cause his boss knows my name
nomming on ben and jerrys cheese cake ice cream
coolest job I ever had, I worked in cold storage and every wednesday morning I would load all the ice cream that would get delivered to Universal Studios. That was a job I would brag about LUL
we had pallets of ben and jerrys. Every friday Id walk the line and pick out a new flavor to stop for on the way home to try lol
I was just about to say I read giant bomb ass
i expect that from ice, but not from you LUL
watch it be on hyrule castle D rod
Goron got the wind knock out of him
i see what you did there
Dude your shield is gonna burn
you think wonka nerds would go ghood with ice cream?
Axl I'm a suckler for dad jokes
Did you hear about the red and blue ships that collided?
All the sailors were marooned. KEKW
does OoT iron boots slow your walk too?
I havent played it since I held a 3DS lol
It's on my switch but i haven't played it in a while
yeah you are right you need 18 Kappa
Is that you axl?? That was awesome
nope, I dont do TP tricks LUL
but ending blow is soooooo cool
like the kid on the trike in incredibles... THATS WICKED AWESOOOOOME!!!
what about the email you sent?
next time send some fan art too
my pint of ice cream is gone PepeHands
I replaced my shitty monitor today
Wait shit you're almost finished...imma miss the rest
sometimes it would turn off while streaming and turn back on like 7 seconds later. Once it made me game over during final in a weekly race lol
it was a lower budget 32" samsung monitor. I replaced with a 27" LG TV. Only cost me 180 bucks
Im wondering if I can finally set up pape dark rooms
Well you're not gonna die anything that's for sure
I told you that you needed those hearts
Semi fixed, only if it's fast 7 is the rng
Yep this is an ass 7
Best way to kill the beast
I forget sometimes mortal draw is a thing
And because you only see it in fucking hundo KEKW
A thing until it's not ya know?
are you gonna stream phantom of the network?
Can we all watch a movie one day?
okay, ill play it myself then LUL
If only you could use those fucking arrows and not her
Both for ww and tp I never liked it
@AnniLyn2 ive done watch parties in phantoms discord
@AnniLyn2 yeah, we did season 1 of bakuman lol
You'd be missing an O xD
I could have picked colo lol
Every time I see this scene and at the mirror...I cry
Oh yeah back at it TTYD style!
if myth resets you guys can race LUL
surprise, surprise... someone else finds the new emerald pop tracker confusing LUL
Btw I saw your title during your minish cap rando monadoKEK
The people don’t wanna hear the truth
there are asking why roxanne has 3 checks, 1 badge, 1 TM, and one event. They made each of the gym leaders an event.
Jokes aside I think LttP is overly praise
Just to have an excuse to reset? OpieOP
like if you play vanilla you know watson opens new mauville, and liza/tate opens space station. they dont need to be events.
I only agree with norman getting one cause that is an archipelago goal
oh wait! watson doesnt lock new mauville, norman does
norman also opens sludge bomb man
roxanne opens peeko but that is very scripted
odds are very low you can skip roxanne
Ah shit I might have to go back to my few seconds late laptop lolz 13%
oh that pushed out emerald tracker 1.3.0 gonna take a peak
Damn if I could see the buttons on that
They finally added underwater routes. I remember Hobbz made a PR for Alices tracker and that never got approved lol. Thats what I stole to add to yorus lol
Phan...who's the lucky lady because damn dude
can u make a poll for giant or mini link?
okay, not gonna lie. the encounter tracking for dexsanity is nice
Maybe a poll on which is better
tells you how many encounters are in grass, surfing, and fishing
Crenel why you do that (I’m behind my data is bad while I do yard work)
What was the hardest part of learning this game for you?
I was gonna say not resetting KEKW
My niece when I put her in an empty basket and slide her around
link being that small should not be able to roll that far
Why are you skipping heat pieces here?
is this being worked on for AP?
I imagine it feels pretty complete tho, like feature rich?
thats great to hear at least since its not being worked on anymore
alright, gonna lay down for the night. Good Luck with your "almost no reset" Kappa
I am enjoying myself at least lol
oh shit I didn’t realize this was frame perfect
I guess it is an rng manip
just needed to see it again I guess lol first try!
Fell asleep so ill see you next stream man...GL and night everyone evo17Hiyo
I drove 8 hours today from Cali back home
if you gotta stop cause it’s too annoying to figure out the backup I’m satisfied with the amount of Minish cap too
Kin stone was correct then? I had an alarm go off and screw up my streaming while I had chicken hands lol
Are dark nuts the most annoying part of these runs?
This is actually faster than WR(worst run) pace
Vaati 2 and being an asshole, name a more iconic duo
god i love this companion more and more
to be fair you have way harder tricks now but damn
is this a confirmed pb still waiting on the gg
and you got peahat clip twice!
ok u pumped me up for a victory bike out.
Well I thoroughly enjoyed that, channel points well spent phanto274Smile phanto274Bless
bye all excellent strim for sure
link awakening would be cool been awhile
my headset broke today phanto274Smile happy fucking birthday to me ugh
NOTED not timing out @Pallos7 today i mean what
Looking at the rockman exe translation tweet and someone asked "what is this and is it coming to switch?" KEKW
yup, patching was easy. Got it running in minutes
arrow keys and enter is cringe tho
is this built off of what you normally run?
I am pretty sure this is from the grounds up
It has instant text and fastrun though
And you don't need to go back to Elm after getting the egg
im hyped for this loud tunnage
There's also some shenanigens that we don't know about yet
Berry Trees shouldn't be I think
Ok we shall see what this is about
For those who don't know, the big upside is that this game can be played Coop with a plethora of other games like Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, Dark Souls, Hollow Knight...
Are you sure it's DST? It's integral.
yo we rolling with the triplets
you have to play the guy in this version?
Is that two mystic water back to back
is this version easier to gen?
just put the yaml file in and hit gen right
NOTED maybe i wont play this
I think better shops is an Yaml option?
my pape yaml doesn't have the blooper difficultly setting cuz idc KEKW
if make sure you have upgrades before fighting bloopers
You can just send yourself 100 max repels
You can just send yourself max repels with /send_multiple 99 SLOTNAME max Reple
You should put the option enable_mischief on
yuraPeek lurks while I prep for business trip
well on everdrive GBA you can swap A and B
holding A has ruined one of my snes controllers
im 60 hours in im already used to it
does this have all the same HMs as emerald?
of course it doesnt have dive tho
whirlpool sounds like a strange one
is it like cut but over water?
cut and rock smash are basically the samw too
did you roll another seed? Thought you were guy trainer
yeah, i leave shops and just start with 50 max repels
like if I gett surf early I mad dash for fortree for ultra balls
Ive never tried better shops in emerald so I dont know what it changes exactly
if thats the case ill just leave it off lol
can you still find kanto badges before kanto?
and HMs are only locked behind johto badges?
is iI like locking HM behind both the johto and kanto badge could be interesting but at the same time it would just make all badges show up eariler. Like you need both fog and rainbow to use rock smash for example. It would be the same tier badge.
thats just to give each badge a use honestly
actually I just had an idea
the johto badges let you do HMs iin johnto and kanto badges are needed to do HMs in kanto
lol, this is coming from someone that doesnt know shit about gen 2
hope so far it feels similar?
sounds like too much to explain given I like details KEKW
you got a purge spinners option in the settings or nah?
was askin cus emerald has it
as much as that basically just turns them into blind trainers
this isnt on like an RC or somethin right?
I guess nothin holds you back from askin them whether a speed choice integration just for the QoL could be done or not
cus like - "being used to" to me sounds like a decent bit in what makes it feel different for ya right now
just peeked the template file and yea - maybe at some point spinner purge happens
hell, given speed choice was mentioned in the related discord channel, maybe there's a chance for the spinner aspect to be done that way
like - I would at least not be surprised if there's some cross ref happening
and for spinners my best guess right now as a "workaround" casual side for this would be blind trainers
soo what I hear is they took note from emerald there?
wanted to say, there's like ilex forest
thats about all I could think off
fingers crossed it gets slapped behind a setting choice?
sounds v much like my gripe in recent with randos all hovering towards "blitz" settings
I dunno if you could make it be a settings choice in this, just know that in emerald stuff like that is doable
so ppl liked the convenience of a flat rando in that sense
when this is one of the games which allows for a logic dense rando
flat rando, bland drink, non carbonated water
thats how it sounds like at least to me (someone liking more logic dense rando)
like - obviously in the end preferences to who likes what
but also like... if its not the vanilla behavior, why not slap it behind a setting and done
it being a forced change in my head only makes sense if the related flags are HELL to change reasonably
that one sounds fine to me, yea
this feels like an "all paths lead back to cut" convo KEKW
and thats not even listing the badges or hms for vic road itself
yeaaa chief I dunno about that - sounds like this as excited as I coulda been there, feels more like the type of rando I dont touch cus it feels flat then
and would be able to find words
as in both standalone crystal and this I mean
cus even if the changes to cut are liked
you could realistically just slap them behind a setting
let people choose to turn it off
cus if you can alter item pools and disable / enable actor behavior during seed gen via settings and let that pass through, SURELY you can set actors to be / not be present (aka, cut trees in this example)
thats a veeery minor thing yea KEKW
you COULD achieve that by shuffling hidden items like you would and then just turning them into junk
you get what I mean right?
just thinkin cus it sounds very much like a thing speed choice whathaveya evolved towards in settings being toggleable like that
like - "its not a feature day 1"
it was mentioned march this year
normally AP ppl are very aware of things and ask for help where its feasible
hold button for mash text is something emerald also has
so I am not surprised at all to see that code here
looks like i am getting a new headset soon
okay hear me out? thats a minor gripe PrideLaugh
as said, all I rly got to that: I get ya PrideLaugh
*shrug* just needs someone to suggest a "hold A or B for advance text" change
you literally take the same code you apply to the A button there and make it an if either B or A continuous input
now I dont know how simple that is on the ram side for either game
but for gba I dont think shit like that matters?
I'm glad you have the octorock playing for you now
and GBC = pokemon luckily has so low an amount of things going on on screen at once that it SHOULD be fine?
That is not how I use my gameboy
its hooked up to a gamecube
that's not how I use my gamecube
and you made it cry more
this HAS to be a crystal unique thing
cus in emerald it does auto advance through those
I thought the advance text was tied to that
that sounds like a bug to me
Ultrakill too complicated my brain frying learning all the shit
"if trainer sanity off = no refights in gyms" whereas "if traier sanity on = refights in gyms"
Funny movement levels are simple to grasp all this combat calc is a lot
last input they got was from someone who was askin about the map thingimabobble from the pokegear to have value KEKW
time to start grinding for another colosseum run
I mean the literal pokegear item being marked as "useful" rather then "junk"
because casuals like lookin at map
that sounds very heavily not even dex shuffle but also evo availability related
cus if I got anything from this so far, its heavily looked and cross referenced between emerald to this and then later got input frm the Crystal rando as it is
even with dex sanity no reason way it cant be shuffle just give a option
and 3rd gen onward had regional and national evo unlocks no?
it sounds like that was a vibrant memory
anyway enough of me phantasizing up ideas I guess KEKW
cus my big recommend is you go and ask them w a detailed set of things whether its something that can be slapped behind settings / looked at
given you played this and crystal rando on its own
meaning you got input from both
does not hurt to ask *shrug*
i'm sitting at my pc lmao
yeaaa that one is annoying to deal with >.>
had mine all taken out cus they were growin sideways
bottom one had to be cut out, so i got stitches
all 4 or 1 side at a time iceblue?
just 1 side. i already had my right side removed last year
left side started giving me issues over the weekend
had mine removed 1 side at a time within a months worth hence the question PrideLaugh
I was scratchin my cheeks w them for about 6 months before I dared annoy anyone w it (derp) so I just was happy for them to be out PrideLaugh
yeah i had my right side removed in september, because it was bad. left side was absolutely fine
and now my left side was like surprise bitch
yea that sounds like teeth rly
you give them room, they adjust
yeah they adjusted right to the dentist table
come to think I should have mine still somewhere
i don't like the sight of blood
only reason I did (and now I dunno if I still got them) was for that "in case I could ever need them"
cus of teeth exchange and such
not too uncommon to have that over custom made teeth (wisdom teeth used for that if its the back ones)
berry is very much something PrideLaugh
friend dropped off a bunch of instant mash, mac and cheese, and puddings for me
insta mash sounds not bad ye
cause i was totally not ready to have them removed today
since i was told over the phone yesterday, that the doc could maybe do it monday LOL
I went w broth and such for like 4 days after each KEKW
@Iceblue hey - better to have that then be on a waitlist for half a year KEKW
i went to smoothie king and got a power punch plus, and i asked the girl for a spoon cause i had my wisdoms removed
like - at least its now done KEKW
omG OUR POWER PUNCH HAS STRAWBERRIES WITH SEEDS
i was like, i know lol, i like strawberries LOL
don't take this from me D:
"I know this risk, deal with it"
oh noooo its a riiiival fight
kanto? nah this is TOHJO falls
thanks for the heads up NOTED
look phantom the only thing i'm happy about
is that i'll be fully recovered before SGDQ
so i can indulge in the sweats
i'd of left the wisdoms in
I still renember when I sat at the dentist after an XRay of my jaws and such
me going "yo uhm this looks like everythings getting punched together by my wisdom teeth"
and he went "yea uhh not good lets not keep that" KEKW
so the only reason i was experiencing the pain on my right side
i was apparently just born without a bottom right canine
but it was hilarious for me
so when the wisdom was pushing up, it was pushing my entire tooth line
@Iceblue a what? *hasnt heard that term*
anyhoo - imma try and be more lurky
sorry about me being massive loudmouth on the settings talk PrideLaugh
its just that sort of thing which at this point I dont get there being points made for / against certain things being toggleable if its not vanilla
cus like - its been LONG ENOUGH by this point for games of this age
and my brain gets riled up by it
The same guy I spoke with last SGDQ is the same person that's reaching out to me about setting up this fogo trip
I hope they put us at table 69 again
Canceling last minute if we aren't table 69
And we're all going to brits pub
"I need 30 orders of curry fries"
I can't wait to go to brits pub like 4 times again
just got back to that KEKW holy where are the bots coming from
the only thing I saw is that some tower? was 2 badges less then e4
I think it was radio tower? unsure hang on
me not knowing 2nd gen that much cus I only played through it 2 times total
I as said dont know - Imma guess its just the rainbow wing / equivalent for lugia?
which I mean - you had rainbow wing, right?
didnt play gen2 near enough KEKW
like - my guess is off of faint memories where you could go into the tower w the bell but only summon ho-oh with the wing
I'd be circling in circles here
but like - brain = I dunno whats happening inthis game to know KEKW
like - the rockets being here has to do with the trainer shuffle option I BET
got phantom rebinding setup. Had to use external joytokey for it that lol
that shit reminds me why I play stuff on console cause that setup was awful
mega rock made a video tutorial for setting up everything
even showing how to get it runnijng on steamdeck
would it be like an everdrive rom?
I didnt think youd be interested in bn like that
I booted up action replay to give heart gold an early GB sounds and it was not as cool as I remember.
the thing for me would be like, if im only running a game for say 3 months is it worth all the effort?
also let me say, I struggled trything to figure out how to map the # key LUL
where are we right now anyway
this is on the way to vic road, no?
was confused cus I could swear viridian forest was still fully there in crystal KEKW
this loops all the way to snorlax bridge, no?
is you now can go back around to misty from surge town right
did rando change it from pecha berry to psncureberry?
then go from there via that p ath around diglett cave?
and then from there all the way around blaine to the frosty cave to kogas gym and such?
aka the entirety of kanto open as soon as surf?
my only exp with these games are the remakes lol
yea ik you dont NEED surf
I'm taking over Rains profile...one second
but getting throgh to cinnabar and shit means you can get all the way to the paths where snorlax in RBY was sitting
I feel like logic in a randomizer is allowed to exist
remakes made this into an actual gym with trainers. This is way more interesting
and as much as I like KH2 rando, its one of the VERY FEW "just fly through game" randos I like in that way
Dark souls falls in too but only if I can set up all sorts of foggate shenaniganry to make pathing a bitch
i forgot how flashy this was
my reason to make extra shenaniganry be possible in Emerald >.> not have it be flatlined by surf 100% of the time
and like - sure it still happens 60% of the time
but there the map changes are a) optional and b) I can have varied logic from it
whereas here what I hear is a lot of "well, guess you can just do this now"
I get that QoL was targeted
but this feels like it aint quite what QoL should be KEKW
how many items on left side of tracker are required?
you know how you can achieve that?
the entire reason for me in KH2 to normally start second chance, once more, scan is a) no 1shots by stupid
and b) see health bars for seeing when what happens
I dont ever NEED need those realistically, but its super neat buffers
omg so cute! aand it's dead
so like... I dont quite get the point then
I forget when I logged off, I think I saw the bulbin fight
can i have a piece by any chance? -Anni
if you fly your ass to Canada sure
I guess I can see why the slope at diglett cave was added
tiger he says he was already planning on it
might be to lessen hm menus?
cus before heartgold soulsilver you had sinnoh
but yea - that at LEAST explains why that ledge is there now
yet in platinum they make us use defog the worst HM ever
you had stuff like the way to spear pillar
doesnt look like much work is done on it sadly
pretty sure someone was working on diamond for ap
idk let me check the ap discord
yeah and the remakes prove that in spades
do we even have a emu that can use lua script for 3ds
and yes blacktiger it was plat as its the most sinnoh you can get
the only thing problematic w sinnoh is sinnoh
cus its SUUUUUPER linear in certain spots
unless you were to mess with the game which arguably, you shouldnt
at least not in a bland "always on" way
it does, but the snowy routes are locked behind quite a lot hms
so like - yea it loops, but its rly a 50/50 between vanilla path requiring the hms to you getting the bike
rock smash towards gym1, flags related from there towards gym2
like - its definitely an interesting map logic wise
we also have a sunshine test version for ap very broken but you can play it
but some spots UNLESS you us use hms without teaching would be pain imo
@blacktiger51 the only thing broken really last I renember was blue coin stars
so that cool we getting gamecube games faster now
all I know about 4th gen is its a HM nightmare unless you have field hms without teaching
@Jonxhas ahh i see i just seen it was playable but you really shouldn't
cus the teaching bit in sinnoh can get annoying real quick in rando
@blacktiger51 you can 100% - the only thing right now I think was blue coin shines and blue coin collection being dumb
logic wise, its definitely the most interesting a mario game to me could be
@Jonxhas ahh i see so maybe a full release soon
what REALLY (imo) is missing for sunshine
is shines unlocking their respective tied to chapter / episode
so you start with the first couple shines in delfino being your guidance towards which stages you can visit and which shines there you can access
because of how its set to be episodic in the first place
might as well make use of it rather then it being just a counter go up thing
like - if you turn sunshine into an SM64 case counter go up thing, where that made overall more sense as much as you could still have done shit with the stars there
I'd just flatout not be interested
cus Sm64 Rando standalone hack sits there letting me have the counter go up thing be interesting in its own right
SMW is that case where to me it feels too artificially added? PrideLaugh like - I get why, but its not for me sorta deal?
I mean - to be fair, SM64R standalone really only gets to be "interesting" if you know your mario movement and dont let it be basic placement
meaning you might actually NEED to have some movement to get them
be it in the form of precise triple jumps or whatever
that being said - I get what you mean PrideLaugh
i wouldn't mind trying sm64 for ap but far too lazy to set it up KEKW
SM64 for AP is also super fucky for setup KEKW
like - for me its a literal case of "I dont want to set this up as it gets flagged and removed by bitdefender"
its look easy enough but you know KEKW
which NO OTHER RANDO gets flagged
like - when a rando setup process involves feeling virus like
its definitely got something to do with the Sm64 pc port shenaniganry
my firewall will probably be like nope then
anyhoo me go back to lurk, as for any change applied to this over standalone crystal: I'd argue towards it being a change made by heartgold/soulsilver brought to life here
cus it really feels like its fueled by that in its changes given the fence v ledge bit at diglett cave
my antivirus deleted my pj64 a couple week ago
if so I cant even blame it KEKW
@Jonxhas the one that nax made
sounds like dodgy antivirus to me
it come with my pc so it was free for like 3 years
what did you DO for THAT to happen KEKW
sounds like your pc might be in some troubles with the sniffles elsewhere truthfully
might be cuz i try to load a patch file by mistake
honestly on the note of crystal here one last thing
cant wait for heartgold soulsilver then
cus that might mean you might be able to get old crystal map back in this
@blacktiger51 yea again: I dont know what you did to your system for that to get flagged
I didnt have any of that sort of issue ever
guess what in heartgold soulsilver also never is there phantom
no idea was fine after i redownloaded it
up at the house of oaks aide, the lower fence in HGSS isnt cut blocked either
so it quite a selective "oh we want this to be like HGSS" change up at diglett cave
I bet it mighta been because the logic ran itself into corners too much maybe
that or some other related bit
item placement is the most common cause of these types of things I feel like
to be fair? I bet it is because of not knowing that AP has minor differences to standalone crystal key item rando
outside of more trainers fought I mean
and the trainer fought tally you could in theory always numb down by means of blind trainers
its v much a "if you prefer this over that" setting
anyhoo - I looked enough into shenanigans for now KEKW
aaand I got fallout 4 open still
I thought when you mentioned fly logic that that refers to like "random fly locale" emerald style logic
not just "oh yea we counter backtracking
whats fly even for logically is my question KEKW
cus I dont get where fly is vital to progression
so its in a way like early MMOoTR Soaring hints
even if that could still mean you finding it behind your go mode
aaanyway I got FO4 open KEKW
and I was lurky barring the "well look at this, silly logic shenanignary" talk
the AP version has HGSS bits in it somehow
cus in HGSS you can go into bell tower / tin tower w just the bell
and the rainbow wing is just for ho-oh
where would the basement key lock things route wise?
is me wanting to know if thats also an HGSS thing
basement key being what it is right?
is a HGSS change as well
HGSS the way you went in isnt basement key locked either
look at the upper right corner, its the room which you were lookin at sayin "well basement key is useless"
which you did do via radio tower right?
and I do renember the rocket outfit bit
BUUUUT it feels like thats why the basement key turned useless KEKW
NOTED not trying this for ap
except the changes made were wished to stay axl
i bet they did this to stop you from being bk
like - the effort to make HGSS oriented changes as well as the wish to keep them
BK mode aka "cant do shit mode"
reason of naming is bc a group around spike had a multiworld where someone was THAT FAR STUCK
that they went for food at BK
i start doing glitches when i am bk
thats the literal origin of the naming scheme KEKW
@blacktiger51 SOME GAMES dont allow you to break them open sideways like that KEK
like - not every game is OoT
where literally NOTHING is a hard lock if you know your glitches
did you find another game to replace ttyd?
i haven't did a ap beside smw that didn't let me cheat
I do enjoy your infi pit stuff
was the pape64 mod you played dark pit?
however, i am just one man
but I wasnt certain that that was the name for it PrideLaugh but I renembered watchin you do some so hence the curiosity
i have been curious about that
universal pokemon rando first I saw
i do love the universal ranomizer
we came back from trash run and i'm instantly confused
gamecube has been doing that lately
i do love a good pit
if i played this is would be weird holding B
Yes in time for a 2nd seed.
what about backing out of your bag?
4 move slots being there with an attacking move guaranteed might come
its not tied to the cries by looks
anyhoo - in terms of "small" things like say moveset with guaranteed attack or animations untied from cries, I would not say thats the big bleh
the big bleh is logic side truthfully IMO
so the vanilla to HGSS changes map wise
like - I am not trying to say that its justifiable to have it be how it is right now
I feel like emerald needs vanilla pokedex due to dexsanity being a thing now
in emerald you also benifit from it if you get an early golbat
my BIG gripe with emerald right?
and you being UNABLE to apply that
oh yeah crobat is hoenn dex
sorry mb on again renembering that ik we had that national / regional dex talk earlier PrideLaugh
my brain's just so used to that being a thing to begin with given 4th gen was my first pokemon experience and from there onwards its always been a hassle
anyhoo: in terms of emerald my wish would be for an optional physical/special split
cus you cant tell me before gen4 that one EVER EVER wants a physical attacker with MOST of the good coverage being special
therefore => trolling if you go physical for the entire run
i enjoy emerald enough that I can look past the split
I wish I could add it in in post
this lanturn will take us far
cus the patchfile messes with whatever AP adds to it
like - you can get all the way to starter select but then softlock
I 100% know that physical/special split is not needed to be there
I just wish for a couple mons to have viable options with dark moves rly in gen3 PrideLaugh
as well as ghost pokemon to not be straight suck past their normal / fighting immunities
and I know I am putting too much emphasis on that
given gengar still gets REALLY GOOD moves
but its rly only gengars line you'd ever want for ghost types anyway
Honestly people who pick grass type starter pokemon are lunatics like youre already vulnerable to bug, flying, ice, poison and fire just by like. Default. And theres guaranteed bug and flying types in your starting routes in every game. Thats fine. This is fine. The world sees your little guy as a walking salad. And if youre playing gold silver and its remakes then screw you and your chikorita because the first two gyms are FLYING AND BUG TYPE but whatever i suppose. Cheer100
kinda makes you wonder wherre I found it Kappa
Is the crying still going on? swifEyes
Character same color pattern as lapras
Thank fuck I hate Gen 1-3
I just don't like the fact of special being a thing of it's own
I know it's 100% me nitpicking, but still, I want my math to be more accurate LUL
imagine playing a rando off of a floppy disk LUL
I saw someone today ask for a poptracker layout that lines up the badges and HMs together LUL
like put surf under the balance badge
HoOh and Luia have now officially fused.
when I did my first seed I made a little guide on my layout for me to glance at if I needed. Plus I dont have to hear "what badge goes with 07?"
Please don't tell me you said that xD
does rando let you do the celebi event?
Aww this one jinx is purple
Axl would you let Smoochum give you grandma level kisses?
why is jasmine in brocks gym Kappa
been thinking about 5X and 4K this week. I imagine the 5X would do what I need from it, but im not in a hurry to upgrade either.
All it would really change is let me play wii stuff
But they look like they'd give the best kisses and werthers candy
oh sorry I totally missed that comment LUL
Nah I wouldnt, only my pupper can give me kisses
Idk about you guys but grandmas give out awesome candy and chocolate
my grandparents ran a citrus store so wed get free oranges, naples, tangerines, ect.
Maybe replace the one on my mom's side though idk her
for one of her birthdays i got her a cake with dicks all over it
I'd be laughing my ass off xD
lai, you just reminded me of an old funny pic
in discord you go by anni banani, right?
i just put it in food lmao
i see where i get my degeneracy from lmao
Ive been looking for this clip forever
I just had to dig thru Lai's DMs LUL
i was defo confused for a sec lmao
goombaria: Thank you for find me doll for me, here take my brother!!
Sorry Axl I was playing a game
People think others are normalizing degeneracy... but never considered that's just how some people are
getting water dont forget to get yo sip on
ok ap version fucking sucks NOTED
what was your free fly location?
they too broke to afford ttyd remake KEKW
phantom of the network lets go!!
How janky are we talkin :)
got the tracker all ready for multiworld. Even split up routes 119 and 121 to account for logic and added artisan cave. Even added wailer pail for that logic
I made a goof I was able to trouble shoot. All the high current sea routes got changed from pokeballs to lttp chests LUL
The last time i seen 2 it was bait :(
I copied and pasted a location route without realizing it but it was missing some stuff from it too. so reason it nulled the pokeball icons
not even the ultra boots partner phanto274D
hmm i wonder where it wants you to go LUL
I def understand that you are
That Goomba avoidance wildly close lolz
how CBT are you being subjected to
Did you look in the controller?
Yikes...we had an issue like that with one of our GC controller
are you on your other gcc
are they modded or stock controllers that theres a difference?
janky? more like GG with my boi
Oh hey Phan I've been meaning to ask
Accidentally went there it had like some elevator type music lolz
makes me so sad we never see bootler in runs
all your cakes have been out of logic too
its a shame they cant do custom BP costs for badges. Like each FP+ has a different BP
yeah it sucks rolling 2 powerr+ at 7BP
just wait for the pc port rando Kappa
That almost sounded like the super Mario battle music
did u just find super boots in the overworld
Wow my first strim missed like ever
Yo! How are you supposed to tell what you need? Cant you go tosunmit?
do you know if you need to get the HM check from steven in mossdeep to open seafloor cavern?

Err better late than never phanto274GL
0/10 game, no raw cock, also gl
no seed is worst than a jet
So for me to get my phone fixed it'll cost $300+ Sadge
It was its own design flaw 😭 it stuffed itself from the inside
i recently got the iphone 15 it works wonders but do i wanna say price amount
Can't you stun him like you did before with the dark koopas?
the end of a pape run...
I have like 2 silver ones though
if you have an ess adapter you can make the triggers press without having to use the full analog
takes a CHAD to do pape
i released the updated web tracker for tpr Gladge
need to swing by the store and grab a tub of rogue energy hydration before the next rando
For me it's being covered by the boing
Was prepared to ask for multiple definitions lolz
i should mod my controller one day
oh yeah i got to mess with that at bgdq
he has a better dpad too
is the hints version in a playable state?
sshd rando and new tpr rando version Gladge
can all shop items be randomized in 1.2?
man now i gotta update my tracker again
i wonder if i should do tpr races one day
so just follow glitchless rules Kappa
all stuff i cant even do so lmao
time for me to become a tpr runner
Always wanted... but don't know how and too lazy to find out
Sucks because agitha music is nice
rel loader is just nice if you want it to go faster
Oh that's what your bot meant by you hurt chuchu
you could load the disc through nintendont still
i think that only helps with lag though
idk if loads get better too lol
Feli I haven't seen that in forever
well youre about to see it rn
I didn't know that's what feli meant
I'm never around in the beginning. Once I was but never noticed that logo lolz
im pretty sure its based off the old sega slogan
I'm a sucker for gore but that's nothing then
Yeah it's an old Sega thing
Yeah you gotta toughen up dude lolz
i forget have you play ss before
is map glitched banned in race settings
is that for the reekfish scent
race settings should allow clawshot anything Kappa
Those scats weren't happy to see ya lolz
is fast spinner not going to be on in race settings
ill have to write down where all the hints are
1.2 is gonna be so good lol
Let's see what I can find
Well that is actually hard to find
are there any randos that are more glitch focused, the only one i know of is wwr
but it seems like most zelda randos are glitchless for races
You tend to go the wrong way a lot too lolz
I think it froze for a bit?
Weird..during the star game it like froze for a few
bird carrying wolf link would make one expensive amiibo LUL
this year marks 10 years of amiibo, wonder if theyll do a special amiibo line to comerate it
felt like it was just yesterday I left toysrus with my first 6, one actually being Marth lol
The "this guy gets on my nerves in melee" Marth?
I mean that happened before lolz
LMAO they said yes you do
That's offensive to chickens everywhere lolz
Just looked at the games that released the year I was born. Super Mario Bros 3. Mega Man 2. Ninja Gaiden. Final Fantasy 2. Dragon Quest 3. Altered Beast. Double Dragon 2. Donkey Kong Classics... okay forget Donkey Kong Classics. But holy moley was the Year of Axl cooking! Cheer100
when I graduated high school we got mario galaxy, bioshock, halo 3, freaking uncharted, god of war 2, the witcher, assassins creed, half life 2 episode 2, the GOAT Persona 3 FEZ, the world ends with you, and metroid prime 3!
I see you've found the sword in city again
was SMP and mario galaxy really the same year?
I had no intention of playing super mario galaxy. I just got home from visiting family out of state and my work forgot to put me on the schedule. So I had a whole week of free time so I got Galaxy day 1 and 100% with mario and luigi that week LUL
it only took me 60 hours casually lol
what is argorok gives boomerrang? Kappa
So like... if link rides down after hitting argorok... what does he do in the last hit?
Not sure if he just jumps off lolz
Did you ever do the one by eldin Bridge?
cause bugs glow in the dark?
Back in time to see my fave weapons werent found yet
Never sure if that poem is cursing you or cursing you out
You look like you had trouble ever pulling the chain lolz
Oh yeah that always slips my mind... needing it for castle
i think you have to wake him up
i think its easier with thrusts
well idk thats just how i do it
I'd wanna fly away too if someone was thrusting at me Feli
Question... what's your favorite type of sweets? Like I'm curious of everyone
@AnniLyn2 Suko or Figs on everything. other than that maybe caramel popcorn or chocalte apples.
I have yet to try caramel popcorn actually... is it like really good?
Let's say yes occasion is... craving for sweets
Too much into cake or cupcakes
that tas guy sure is fast
How to kill a spider: acquire dominion rod then slam it with giant statue
whats the timer for on the lets go tracker?
Well I have the master sword if you need it. It's kinda small but should work FeelsOkayMan
He can't say impressive sword to you
I mean the MS was in the castle before
Reaper and I did a blind blitz seed that was terrible, then glitchless
Impatience is like your best friend
GGs im going to bed now
okay cool, I jump in first thing in the morning if I wake up early enough lol
so how you liking race settings?
Still salty about the MS? Lolz
I mean... you went straight to boss in ToT
Great job on the sub 4 completion but holy monoly was that a healthy seed. Have a great one then.
o7 i died in my seed
enemies shuffle with deathlink was a mistake
no i don't have points Kappa
good luck, ive heard this game is a bad example
Im eager to do more AP but all my remaining stuff is out of logic
I got letter, which opens slayport at least
bet made you add it to the poll
It's just gotta be longer than 45 mins today Prayge
Looking forward to the eventual hundo then
Yo king zora have a coin for RvPA
I think it’s insane they even named every single one
Read in an interview that they were considering making this game M rated and there are vaulted voice recordings of Shadow shouting fuck
Bless the slow load times 😁
all i know about this game is that shadow says damn
Thank you god for only putting charmy in one level
Go Charmy, kill those black creatures
Is this where chaos control needs to be accurate?
btw this game follows the tradition of the player in the 2nd port can controller the follower character so this is Maria's only playable appearance in Sonic
getting ready for Sonic X Shadow Generations?
Do you have to kill 60 of those things to finish the level?
Yeah this game's levels are infamous for how easily you can get lost or miss something important
When I played all endings for this game casually I had to route which levels I could finish quickest for every subsequent playthrough
are you doing the dark route?
Oh this is the level where you can kill the president
WHAT IS THAT THING ON YOUR ARM
I still can't believe SEGA actually had it in them to bring back one of the worst Sonic villains for a new game
You say that as if they had no other choice
Tails: Shadow, isn't the president just the COOLEST?
Look...people can find grinding levels cool but it takes forever and you can barely put in enough speed
Plus accidentally falling off is easy lolz
I love how all the NPCs yell at Shadow like he's stupid when he just has no moral compass
‘My latest and greatest creation’ and it’s the worst invention of all time
This will never not be one of the weirdest final bosses
The Eggman bosses feel like they were leftovers from Sonic Heroes planning
Shadow's classic karate chop of death
I'm dozing off like so hard...I'm just gonna play you in the background evo17Hiyo
did you get a controller sorted out?
I do wanna get another gamecube controller
trying to hold on to my sealed smash wiiU controller
I dont have any OEMs lol
well I do have one but it needs a shell and a stick
I thought you changed it again lol
I like jokehow's next comment gets timed out... perfect for raids LUL
Could you have something like for Pape where you have to equip a stupid badge for 5 mins?
Slow go your right not much movement in 5 mins lol
oh, Shadow's done already? I had to leave for a meeting
And you name it poop Sadge
I LEARNED THAT GOUT'S A BITCH
Yea that shits annoying af hate foliage
Have you got more damage set on this?
Yikes those badges sure are something
Wasn't a bomb bag this time
Because they dont like fast food!
goombario got caught by the IRS for tax fraud and has been imprisoned
Are you only 1 tubba key away from go mode?
Sounds like a hell of a night
this seed definitely made you work
atleast it gave you all or nothing, that's kind of nice
As the great Falbi always says:
Are yousure? Looks like the area of stars
You gonna let that defected thing hit you like that?? Show him who's boss lolz
That was supposed to have the word egg before thing but now it doesn't sound awesome phanto274D
Sorry I'm hyper af on hot buffalo wings from dominos
I mean they're crazy popular so it'd make sense to cost so much...but there's a point where it's too much for such small wings
His strategy is like button mashing lolz
I love how bowser stomps like a bratty kid xD
Rain: "you see why I watch him??"
have an awesome rest of your night phanto274Smile
destiny 2 dlc tomorrow so i will be lurking for a couple days getting raid ready
twitch mobile sucks even more than before
Oh damn, I'm pumped for GDQ this year. I'm actually gonna get to go
Inb4 you die 5 seconda in
I love the idea that whoever is playing this needs to be introduced to the character of Sonic. Like someone's just out there super into Shadow and has no clue who Sonic is
Ive heard this is the best sonic game
This game is missing the rad as hell Knuckles soundtracks
That tornado is not carrying a car
Is there a Chao Garden? A good one?
Inferior. I demand Chaos with guns
Alright a Charmy intro is necessary. I have no idea who that is.
Are bees canonically the size of people in this? Or I guess bigger since everyone is kinda thicker than any humans I've seen
I've decided I don't like Charmy. Big Navi energy
Holy shit they let Human Woman run around? I love that
I forgot about Tails. I forgive Charmy
Wait isn't that actually really fucked up to say if Charmy is a bee?
Wheres Big the Cat? That's what we all want to know
He's off fishing and / or looking for Froggy
true story, Big survived a zombie apocalypse for a while, he eventually became a Zombot only because he didn't realize Froggy was infected
@buff00n wait whaaaaat?! That's crazy. Is this comic lore?
Eggman, why is that a feature in the roulette
Wait he gave himself the last name "Android"?
Holy shit did they just execute him?
you’ve heard of origami now here oriGONE YOUR LIFE
Does Shadow Android dream of electric sheep?
That's actually crazy. Maybe I should play this game
Apparently, True Hero story is canon. Which makes sense to me cuz Shadow keeps running into people who know him and his backstory / past
why tf wouldn't they tell him who he is
Pure Dark Shadow basically destroys the Earth
Dark route, you try to assassinate the President
Shadow is inside all of us.
you might like Cyber Track (Advance 3) aesthetics
they gave you the sex appeal character on the internet stage
it would have been a fair reason though
Wait, Rouge is also a narc? She really doesn't have anything going for her
Rouge's main thing is stealing shit, the spy thing's more of a side hustle
you sure this is glitchless? ive seen like 5 gliches happen in the last 20 minutes
its like paying ffor 6 subs but you only get 5
do a route where we dont have to hear charmy LUL
Did you know Charmy is banned for life from his local library acording to the comics
yesterday I PB'd in mario party by like 10 minutes
not the best tails voice but its better than sonic heroes at least LUL
Last time I tried replaying this I got to one of the Tails levels that had a line where he said he felt safe around GUN and I got so mad I had to stop playing
They're like a bunch of Charmys
thats good to hear, I really like how SA2 controls
spinning to go fast on grind rails neveer made sense to me
Eggman uses Chaos Emeralds to fuel his gambling addiction
i was just typing about that to ask KEKW
are the hints in this build too?
are the settings any different from what you normally do?
yeah, gonna watch that vod before I try this
thats a nice balance, not wasting so much time there
is it fine to just jump in or should I watch that 3 hour vod first?
gotcha, I have no idea where to look in TP discord. I only go there if I have a question lol
If I remember correctly...you said this run is 1.2?
RP rando races wont let you view chat, thats def a turn off for me
yeah like if its beign restreamed thats one thing
this being the cev version was generation any different?
does the new one work with 1.1 too?
today i sent off my busted new 3DS XL to nintendo. I didnt get much use out of it and I dropped it ruining the top screen. Its cheaper to fix it than go 2nd hand and curious if I can play it without hands cramping
85 to fix plus shipping and tax. And if they cant fix it theyll send me a 2DS XL
how does mines bos key work?
and you have arbiters boss key despite it not being in logic?
Agitha is her own Zone. Barren Castle Town does not mean that Agitha is guaranteed dead.
issac posted that in racetime so thought id mention it
i didnt know that was RNG, I always got bottle first try lol
Will you be posting your 1.2 run on YouTube?
I'm okay yeah I've just been sleepy
Them legs need the exercise man
how's the rando so far feelin?
unless its specifically not been done after OoTRs path hints
how's the required / not required hints feeling so far come to think?
given that their origin afaik is MMR
so its 1 forced logical, the other forced tied to the fool region
wee bit limiting unless every region has a sign
didnt know if every dungeon has one / got 1 placed for that purpose
cus like - arbiters or PoT come to mind
so there's been a couple extras placed
kiiiinda sad that that as the only way to get them hints going in that way, but at the same time *shrug* sorta thing
the OW ones surely would be not in eponas way / ppl start routing around it
anyhoo: hints with OoT / MM as their starting point for this game sound pretty poggin overall
here's a question: woth over path is an option or nah?
the wolf item here's now where the wolf would be
was wondering what the holdback for that truthfully was given they were figured out as items
its not vanilla to not get them after the 2nd round of dungeons
so all I got was feather and knuckle badge, strength and dive. Still waiting on someone to send me shit
if the dev team in question cares for it
imma hazard a guess in the sign here possibly being near Ooccoo or towards ook based on earlier descriptions of "well its not on the main path necessarily"
what language should I play pokemon X in?
but yea to an extent I get the whole "lets keep things as close to vanilla as possible"
at the same time, MMOoTR comes to mind where outside of mechanical stuff, you get all sorts of non vanilla extras like "clock shuffle" or other such things
not to mention OoTR and MMR having options like disabling shitwiggle / critwiggle / lowhealth close camera / whatever you wanna call it
MMR recently got an option for a more responsive / OoT style camera for ledgegrabs and such, stuff like that
gonna hazard a guess in that not being the full pathnotes list? PrideLaugh
other then that it pretty much sounds "rando updates" to me in a way, more things and knobs to turn / press
nothing tooo out of the way
kinda get this game away from the LTTPR case yea
cus in 2d most of the time the overworld is not that huge so its not that big a deal
but 3d overworlds can take a WHILE to traverse depending on which things are locked deep
and like - yes that still can apply to 2d but its MOSTLY not that big an issue in 2d games last I receall
the one thing I hope for (currently not doin big searches on hints) for the TPR related hints is that there's no weird edge case "sometimes required" in the requirement listing options
cus BOY HOWDY have I seen lots of funky stuff come from those KEKW
for reference: MMOoTR when it got that hint type had some issues where for some reason it basically was required still in some cases
and in MMR its always a tightrope walk between doing that off the beaten path check depending on where it landed over waiting for the item equivalent if it hit like say, magic meter or bombs, ikana access masks stuff like that
which is to be expected of item placement
just that it definitely feels funky knowing say, your magic is somewhere decently "slow" but there's another one which could be even worse
and then feeling out when it makes sense to go for it or not
I wouldnt be able to rly have a word for how that could go bad / well, I guess my bigger feel there goes towards "if its not toooo overly aggressive, it sounds like it should be fine"
curious how the lake hylia portion is then split up
cus I'd hazard a guess saying that lamp cave is its own region?
and then for hints like... lower and upper lakeß
cus both are still relatively massive
so yea its been split a bit
does it update dynamically on getting swords or nah?
was curious bc in MMR you now got swamp / ocean / regional fairy hints available
and all of them are respectively dynamic in "only hints whats not picked up"
so if you got oath already, the oath hint will just not pop up
and for skull tokens / fairies, you can then use the hint again to narrow down regions left in play
cus its not like you're getting dumped a 15 to 30 step bucket list on your head in ONE massive ongoing textbox KEKW
MMR has spread out hints through the gossip stones too
just that for skull / fairy chases, you got so many that a hint strictly to those = lots of text
like - I cant judge the textboses being that massive there
just was curious if this was going the ultrafancy dynamic adjusting hint route KEKW
the key's not in your pockets KEKW
and other then what I just wrote out, it very much reads to my brain like how other woth/fool hint systems have so far feeled in casual puzzlesolving ways
Landed safely. but will probably do a twitch website break.
btw also found a wikipage about ooccoo on the tpr side of things: the whole shenanigans with ooccoo being dummy is listed
hey - better then "this or that gold bug has your boss key" KEKW
cus thats another option it coulda displayed as if you wouldnt junk them agitha rewards KEKW
Skyward Sword had the right idea bring those back
big keys being anywhere is something i disagree with but idk i havent really tried a seed yet
what you COULD do if thats a huge point of bleh
is place HCs sign right outside the entrance to HC near the gate rather then inside
is HC big key your go mode?
the big key sounds to me like goal AND what you could then do
is make that sign in front of hyrule castle have the Goal listed on it over ordons sign as an example
as in: keep ordon sign for which dungeons are required
oh so thats how you get over here normally
i always to the lja off the peahat
but have the text at the HC one say example mirror shards: "The Hero of Twilight has to find all the mirror shards to open this door. the Key leading to his final destination is located in <Region>"
like - *shrugs* it sounds simple if adding signs is already out of the way as a possible point of bleh :D
especially given that particular room I mentioned basically has nothing going on past weather effects
thank you rando for building in a possible "person sees item warps out finds out its the wrong big key"
also not true, snowpeak big key was in the desert KEKW
coming from MMR? I agree KEKW
from OoTR? I dunno, I kinda prefer the dungeons in a SP scenario being puzzly
at the same time in multiworlds, you better let me have key rings KEKW
hints seem to speed things up quite a bit though
its definitely a speedup if you're not zoomies like phantom or other experienced ppl in this game
if you'd be me? it'd mostly be a speedup cus I do less things KEKW
like - phantoms side is gameplay AND hints speeding things up
I guess what I also am now curious about right
is the alotted hint options KEKW
cus I am so accustomed to playing rando with hints with gossips trackers
you got always hints, sometimes hints, woth/path hints
im gonna try a seed tomorrow i think
once upon a time i knew this room
but yea like - tldr, my brain's now in gossips mode
because like - I definitely DEFINITELY would like to prep myself a gossips tracker layout now KEKW
cus like - all I'd need is a list of always / sometimes hints currently available and amount of woth/fool hints
item specific ones like big keys, sords are not an issue to my head
swords even, MAN I swear I can type
if this is still 3 cycles i think just doing a spin attack after the jumpslash is better
i swear link just wont do a spin attack here for no reason
sounds rather common to happen truthfully
tbh i would prefer just being in go mode after beating all 3 dungeons
like - what IMO would alleviate Big key for HC if keyshuffle for it
is the HC sign being before you open it
as that can then be tied into routing
yes, OR you take my silly thought from earlier
list the settings goal (not the required dungeons) as well as HC big key in the scene where HC wolf would be, SOMEWHERE there
so that you can still rush past and push the door open easily
but also have it be "similar to OoTRs pedestal" in a way
like sort of that train of thought in my head
OOOR fancy stuff given the ordon goal sign exists
add the HC Big key as a last line of dialog there
right now definitely sounds the easiest
but like - imo Big Key hint for HC defo sounds like that thingy you want info on early rather late
as for my point of reference from a puzzle solving POV: ToT pedestal in OoTR => lists your regions / dungeons for where you need to be to get your meds / stones or if its skull tokens, amount
and then further, tells if the Big key for dorf is found in there, got after getting mo Gode or whathaveya
the only outlier being Keyshuffle where you're just searching for it like a Go mode item
and a "Go mode item get" sounds rather fancy to add to any game
again: this is not cus I rly rly like OoTR as to where that thoughts comin from, its from the puzzle solving POV of things
cus for me MM / TP tie pretty close for most fave zeldas
either settings or settings + hint rly yea
like - imo that sign in HC rly only needs to be existent IN keyshuffle anyway, and then why enter HC for knowing where your search goes for it PrideLaugh
like - I 100% agree with it being existent
cus like - not everyone does start with the big key
and given small keys exist, I am curious how those tie into those signs as well
cus I WOULD ASSUME that they would slap onto the same sign then
path hints sound roughie given the exclusive nature they are at
Forest temple barren is definitely something
also I saw what, 3 hints on that single sign?
so what I hear is I need to do a couple of these so I get total count for hints down
I found the hint types explained
so time for me to find their yt name KEKW
thats some rather extensive force at birth right there I guess? KEKW
I was disassociating until I heard that
ahhh thats how the sword hint works
its not on a static sign, its mixed throughout the others
I'm learning that you have to fight the main character as a boss in FF15 cuz he hates veggies
he's one of the hardest bosses in the game
my guess is its bc flag order so as to not lock yourself
or some vanilla to rando interferences
just wanna say this: I need to play a couple seeds to definitely figure out the hint totals it feels like
because like... none was mentioned for fool / woth there in totals
only always / sometimes were lsted
is it just me or are those doors backwards
Just watched a video about how hackers found a vulnerability from a casino. There had a fish aquairum that could have its temperature set remotely and the hackers were able to compromise high roller profiles, financial transactions, and security checks. Not gonna lie, the fact they got all this from a "fish tank comp" sounds like something ripped straight out of battle network. Cheer100
the double clawshot locale you mean?
so your guess is that you might be key locked cus LJA?
I meeeean... you did beat morpheel right? or didnt cus wood stick?
thats west you're concerned about right?
yea so logic towards deku toad wants minimum 2 smalls logical
has a 2/3 req listing for before deku toad chests and that
which pretty certain glitch logic would
also given your items, Imma go lean out the window and say you might have a seed where it might tbe a 2 with the 3rd on morpheel
or was clawshot in the deku toad locked areas?
sooo you are fully out of logic then KEKW
kanapeWave Did they finally make a TP randomizer that doesn't require a modded memory card save?
cus clawshot is required for that direction by logic
(CanDefeatDekuToad and (Lakebed_Temple_Small_Key, 2) and Zora_Armor and Iron_Boots and CanUseWaterBombs and (Progressive_Clawshot, 1)) or (((Lakebed_Temple_Small_Key,3) or (Setting.smallKeySettings equals Keysy)) and (canLaunchBombs or ((Progressive_Clawshot, 1) and canSmash))) <--
I'm behind the times then ._. the only TP Randomizers I could find required you to use a special GC save file.
this is for Lakebed temple before deku toad alcove chest
Zora_Armor and Iron_Boots and ((Lakebed_Temple_Small_Key, 3) or (Setting.smallKeySettings equals Keysy)) and (canLaunchBombs or ((Progressive_Clawshot, 1) and canSmash)) <-- (ignoring underscores) for lakebed temple before deku toad underwater right chest
which in your case canLaunchBombs = bombs + rang
hard to tell for me other then peekin logic PrideLaugh cus like - I am playin some Fallout4 over here so didnt see everything ya did in there
but it definitely sounds like you miight have a diff clawshot elsewhere so that west wing makes more sense then
central hub left before door = FT sign
slightly off to the left near the left torch
and snowpeaks is in yetas room
what I am hearing? lots of "well just dont do silly bogus while not in logic" KEKW
my guess would be morpheel has a small key
sooo again: my guess stays there until proven not right KEKW
as for "oh yea LJA's are race legal" - WW has storage race legal
and with that you can straight up delete items KEKW
so I rly just hear "skip responsibly" in big fat text blinking letters KEKW
like - yes the intent is definitely different
but WWR has no securities around storage built in
we like having fun and going fast
you can bring that up same as possible hint thoughts you had from last seed I bet
just that things skipping through logic in a glitchless logic seed to me sound like a "wellllll you fucked up your fault" KEKW
cus like - this isnt like OoTs restrictive movement when it comes to LJAs
and they can skip quite a lot of things in funky ways
PLUS I need to double check the room / entrance related subregion logic in Lakebed from whats github visible rn again before I could say a thing
but it does read like east wing / west wing have a small array of options on key placement
hub left before webbed door near torch as reminder for the sign
and skipped a key he should not have
also my bad on the he 😅
Roopa opened my seed im so happy!!
and no other bow has been found so far
logic CAN require that sorta shenanigans as far as my understanding goes
hey chat look how good I can smoke ﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞﱞo runera3Swag
and any "Imma break out of the logic barrier" goes at a certain risk
honestly? here's my 5 cents on key logic: just flatten them instead of having multiple options
cus what it sounds like is you got the east requiring 1 or keysy for this
then 3 or keysy with the other doors
bets 3rd key also is this direction
pfft this one you can easily risk free LJA to KEKW
this seed is hilarious in its own right
outside of you having had key locked yourself
also like - my guess towards the key doors goes as follows
even if it makes item placement in this dungeon slightly more dogwater
"require all small keys for all the key doors, done"
yes, granularity in item placement is interesting
but in this case, it easily can create whoops scenarios
HOWEVER glitches unless glitched logic is chosen for rolling, is not required
for glitched logic it also makes sense
not mmr with its 10 million logic settings
for glitchless granular item reqs based on placement while interesting in its own right (puzzle solving) is definitely a "well fuck" in others
especially if you turn on everything and seeds take a day or days even to gen
there's no way on the outer ring with the water and shit to clawshot up to upper east wing?
right cus the key door is past the bridge
i remember old mmr when glitched logic was just one button you pressed
HC BK in snowpeak would be grand now, wouldnt it
also @Feli_Heli you could theoretically still do that
so should we complain in the discord and tell them to turn off keys Kappa
honestly here's a better thought then complain about keys being on p4ntzSip
just make a point in altering item placement for lakebed to make all key doors req all 3
since this case can come up
and someone losing a race because they chose to rush a direction on 1 key =/= breh
cus like - we're talking a 1/7 to come up, 1/8 if we count zant
yes, BUT one of the 3 doors has an option to require only ONE small key
it can never be a dungeon
and given your item placement, it MUST be upper east
@Feli_Heli just because a dungeon in this setting is never an option doesnt make it not be an option to happen
my thought's not on "specific subsetting" but general "rando puzzle / races" thought
so you got 8 dungeons barring HC
and if 3 / 4 are required on average
you have about a 33 to 50/50 on lakebed appearing
and having a 50/50 on lakebed happening
this instance of key placement is not uncommon to find
BUT with LJAs you can skip past those checks up there
therefore softlocking yourself if that has your keys
MY point: make all the key doors in lakebed require 3
meaning yes, the first couple chests of lakebed (preferably not chandelier as you got like 5 still) would be keys
and your items in that dungeon would be slightly deeper
HOWEVER it prevents this type of softlock from happening
because this LJA shenanigans is not uncommon to see
and if someone loses a race not because of skill, but because of the doors they open, seeing they NEED to reset to not lock themselves out of things
it definitely sounded like a heavy jet seed
tbh I think its probably fine to keep keys as they are, and probably just have to consider what the logic wants you to do first with the key
that is OVERALL where I am sitting
but I also sit at the MMR "oh yea get your keys back bitch" convenience KEKW
and OoT last I recall you cant skip keys to the point of softlock within glitchless allowed tricks
and since this is the only dungeon where you could softlock yourself, IMO just enforce small key logic to be 3 before any door
would it change item placement? definitely
but it would also proof it against LJAs
and therefore then allow for fun time routing
as much as it could also require earlier clawshot if one of the smalls is on chandelier
my density brain honestly never goes lower right side first
so I would never have encountered what you did PrideLaugh
for potential softlocks? that small key placement being how it is sounds like it could be a small problem cus like... LJAs are THE first trick I could see ppl learn after Boss quick kills strats for dungeon finishes
given its really REALLY easy to get into, get the hang of and then experiment with
definitely would say makes sense to point these 2 things (HC big key hint, lakebed smalls placement) out
will be a minute, still gotta fill my water bottles, enjoy the dog island music
it wasn't me this time blacktiger phanto274Lurk
good, its about time someone swiped it from you
I got it, after Curtis said first in chat
Yay I made it in time again
Ok, I lurk now while I do paperwork and prep for work phanto274Lurk
had this dream someone stole these cookies I made, spent the ENTIRE dream running up and down a 13 floor building on a manhunt, boiling with rage
I was so angry in the dream, I woke up mad irl
on your tracker you leave randomizer options the same?
whacka is under the blankie phanto274ColonD
Can see for a thousand miles in this cave
im talking about the window you turn on bug and poe locations
yeah so I just need 1 sky character
Perfect music while riding a horse
sure, If I wanted I could do that myself LUL
I only did all the emerald updates for AP, im bound to forget stuff there
there are your 5 poes LUL
So what they change up here
As far as patch update for rando or whatever
which in a race if someone finds spinner like 30 minutes early then they just win LUL
I mean I get that cause I seen the fast spinner
whats your take on no chat during races?
I seen kh2 do that too, no chat in races
Most folk chats are don't help anyway
And you aren't paying attention to it lmfao and you have mods and you can moderate right
Get one warning and the message gets deleted
Pinned message saying not looking at chat
someone casually dropped the castle key outside lol
is hype cave a different zone?
still need to actually watch that vod
does magic armor still make you walk slow?
I have a big notepad next to me id prob just scribble it down lol
your old pape tracker had a notes section
Main progression items bow boots clawshot etc are good items to do
so money wise its just coro, charles, and bridge donation?
Just a happy dance today! Nothing has broken in a week and a half and getting new TV delivered today phanto274ColonD
Mine was 3 years old and stuffed out fighting the company lol love Australian consumer laws
you have to get off to get items too
So what's new with this rando now?
the only "hint" you got was which dungeons are in logic
we start with no sword and shield?
Ah yea  how good should save a lot of time on things then
reading hints is a skill itself too, so itll take time
DK64 has a hint system like that too
does emotracker give you metrics like how many people downloaded your tracker?
I know Ouro had interest in making a pape pop tracker
youre ruins keys are still there tho?
so what is need to open ruins? 2 fishing rods, fish scent...
im confused about how agitha is supposed to work
i never gave her 8 bugs
but i still got iron boots
btw in japanese snails and bugs use the same word hence why they are bundled together herre
one piece uses snails like a phone and they call them "den den mushi"
lantern was on the path to what again?
plus there is a zora that sells water bombs
is there an rgb lantern color option?
havent toched this rando in awhile, legend hunt took my attention
btw, there were rumblings in discord about just dropping steven in the champion room
oh, it was skipping E4 taking you to steven in the final room
A couple people have pitched it because they think the E4 is slow and uninteresting. The version of it I'd be okay with is having the badge checker door lead straight to the champion room where you fight Steven with his team instead of Wallace. I've not done any work to make that happen.
I like hyrule castle not having progression lol
you go there and be done
but at the same time that makes it uninteresting
I still need to play vanilla TMC
Did you do Link's house basement lantern check?
The spinner one is Lanayru Field
Jovani still in logic I think
yeah, we havent been to arbiters so we havent seen jovani
You are right, he is just money
you found it with double clawshot 33 minutes in
grotto by clawshot chest under bridge
there's a heart piece ina tree too
Im rusty i dont rmember the location names lol
All i noticed was bombs and out of logic stuff
like sky big key and sky character
Bomb bag as path more likely when Lakebed is a dungeon
nothing to the west you said
didnt see anything in lakebed except bosskey
almost 2 years since Xeno 3, you thing monolith is working on another one or a different project entirely?
so i matched your tracker and without ball and chain 3 checks in ruins showed green. Mansion Map, east courtyard chest and east buried chest
you didnt keep note by chance how many hints you got?
just my brain being curious cus there HAS to be a range for path/woh and barrens
me being curious on the respective hint totals per hint type yea
It is based on the distribution. For non-race ones it is weighted, so not an exact amount
imagine if you still had zora armor LUL
This race one currently has 3 barrens and 3 or 4 paths
purely curious cus huuge fan of Gossips tracker for myself with OoTR / MMR in regards to that
and like - things like the sword number hints as its called are ez to tie in
thats like finding lights early and not being in glow mode KEKW
for reference: OoTR Glow mode = having to find lights specifically
isnt so nice wee dont have to do goats ever seed KEKW
treasure room is bound to have a piece of heart for you LUL
makes sense though that the totals for a casual rolled seed per hint type arent set in stone (outside always / sometimes)
right you still have half milk
Magic armor sounds like THE clankers replacement if it clanks for credits
assuming it hasnt spoiled going to the desert and all
is there ever a true reason in this though... KEKW
half the time fire arrows from the bokos / moblins dont even burn it
no more double slawshot skip FeelsBadMan
just a minor case of mind poisoning for zelda
dont forget magic armor for cutscene
also zelda's still thinkin about eating gummy bears
i need to learn that strat
wait is ice block in the pool now?
ice block puzzle based on the video essay on hints is an always hint ye
cus its such a long haul to go through even if you know the path
think the goron hotspring water also is in the pool? or was that sometimes
yeah, ive done goat in 25 seconds once before
as for sometimes hints - makes sense for them to currently be in a "often hint" case as hints are very new to this
so until tinkered with in terms of hint type amounts based on community input and all
isaac, thanks for putting this rando together. Really been enjoying my time with it.
WE'D ALSO APPRECIATE MEMBERSHIPS, IF Y
i just got some wings, and am ready for another seed phanto274Hype
Thanks! I was the main one behind hints, but definitely not the only one behind the whole project lol
thats a lot faster than booting on gamecube LUL
oh! curiosity on yesterday stuff: what came of the lakebed minor softlock PrideLaugh or was that just a "just do better" moment?
oh yeah, for sure. I couldnt imagine TPR being handled by a single person lol
I COULD @Axl_SR BUUUUT having it be a team is always better imo
i'll still be there watching it either way!
I watch your zelda randos at double speed and never see ads
i forgot to mark hyrule keys
can you do that in vanilla too?
vanilla has flags in place so that the sword isnt there
its only there during the night wolf section afaik
Anni says hi, I just handed her some BK
@XSRC_Rain handing someone BK is like handing someone a puzzle without all the pieces p4ntzSip
cus you know - BK mode
She was hankering for some Buffalo nuggets and fries, so it all works
snack first, puzzle solving after anyway
oh right, I wanted to mark excluded checks as complete
no no, the snail is bad(ass)
but phaaantom, that's the looogical explanation for that
trackerr missing - Doctors Office Balcony Chest
I see invoice but not the chest... weird
the what in the who? whats THAT game KEKW
weird, its not on mine, below magic armor is blessing donation. Ill add it in later
made you stand on it rather then in front of it KEKW
Sometimes mozarella sticks are a crucial weakness for me
ive got some stuff to add, I dont even see hawkeye phanto274D
@officialtpsy1t we're not cheap, we like classy viewers here tippiCool
Apperently I drove through a whole ass tornado today LOL
the sirens didn’t go off and I had to pee
I found it, balcony chest didnt show until I marked temple of time as complete
same thing for talo shooting too
watch spinner be in links basement again
id love it if they mad a dedicate horse call button like d pad down
why would you when you have fast spin?
that cliff is secretly a mario 64 painting
i thought that was the clown LUL
You can hawkeye the 2nd bug from the 1st one btw
if you were skipping the sign
From the lower one, you can see the upper one
Idk, but you can climb up on the left side of this lower fench to access the lantern grotto
Twitch! I am a sub! Why are you overlaying a "paid promotion" link over the stream. phanto274Rage
better yet then: why am I not seeing that KEKW
when is the earliest you can view hyrule key hint?
at HC access or finding it
you have zora armor? its not marked
im counting items for go mode not remembereing boss keys lol
what do you think about toggling zones names under the boss key for where it is hinted at?
its very clear on obs lol
id be so satly find lantern like that
rolling with a sword doesnt look safe
rando should add Boar Call KEKW
make it progressive, boar call then horse call
so the small chest on the other side of this camp, is that in the pool?
I meant the one before the 4 chests
That hit should've lit the lantern
or with other words: boss keys and everything sitting there havin a teaparty
dungeon = yes, but its required
You know when writers don't have anything to write... but with tpr items
what do we need double clawshot for? p4ntzThink
co-op looks interesting now relaying hints back and forth
that sounds like details to me phantom phanto274Smile
Looking at gohma makes me shiver
well, fingers crossed that the ice rod to your ice rod isnt buried deep KEKW
link sure needs to stick shit behind his back, dont he KEKW
It'd be hard to reenact though
illegitimately aka practice patch? not rly
Have a while playthrough without sword
MDH would break the sword not being on the back, no?
y is link a wolf everyone knows his fursona is a pink rabbit
yesterday I sent you a bunch of navichips
im so annoyed I cant do anything lol
if I could just get dynamo I can reach meteor falls
Wish there was a TP discord server... not really solely on randomizers
like a TP speedrun discord KEKW
No i mean just to talk about the game
Could've jumped where the little chest was I think
thats the clip phantom was talking about LUL
No sassy remark to that one
I ask that question every seed I play
Oh to? Idk flood the temple probably lolz
and a crack that small, how does it drain that body of water so fast
like you sink for a long time
you have enough time to do another LUL
exactly! what could go wrong? 🤷‍♂️
The elevator is open in these settings btw
for elevator all you need is iron boots?
thought it had an iron boots switch
I hope to be as sassy and mean as midna
I think the last elder is locked
3rd is door that leads to the room with the long rotating platform pretty sure
tracker says 3 keys but I think its only 2
must be a 1.2 bug, make sure you report it KEKW
I'm gonna go ahead and fall asleep...sodium hits hard
so what was the fyrus hint again
Not yet axl... soon. I'm just chilling with background noise
this was a pretty fast seed
didnt acquire drip though so it doesnt count
redo it, but grab lantern before hype cave this time
someone made a model swap for sshd link to add magic armor, so when i do sshd rando on friday ill still have drip
I found my yugioh deck from 2005 today
if you were used to these settings this wouldve cleared sub 2
so "something good" could be a key item that doesnt lead to anything? like hylian shield?
Not hylian shield since that does nothing logically
I'm not sayin the youtube viewers smell bad but all I'm sayin is that there's a nasty odor coming from their direction kazamsCatglub
Leave a comment if you refute my claim
this is the first time I thought to myself "I kinda wanna play unite" all season and ohrocks is in mexico
im still 8K short from redeeming another seed
Phantom I noticed you have a redeem for an average speedrun
Why can't I redeem a good speedrun
I swear there's more from him
quotes 62 and 26 in that order
feli could race you thins time
nah im watching youtube and stream rn
i just wanted to try the warn feature
feli over here cowaring in the corner
oooh how do I warn someone
What does that look like 4 u axl
you can click on their name too
I just said how's it goin
Wait I need to see something lemme boot up the alt
like mods could do that as a spoiler warning before a race
Ok what I wanted to work veyr much does
well we KNOW you need AG
The weed mario ascii fits in the warning
this goron had the SAME SNAIL TWICE NOW
I reported that chat warning KEKW
okay ^ makes sense if music shuffle
why THE FUCK does it make sense
you may not even have to read the sign
ARbiters, time, and hyrule... there you go
🙃 just guess the last one correctly, ez
links house sign now is quite out of the way KEKW
ok so Im trying to understand how bugs work still lol, so when it says there are 8 bug rewards, does that mean you can only find 8 bugs in the world, or can you still find them all
A bug is basically the same as Ashei's Sketch
monadoNote ooooh ok makes sense now
i was wondering why bugs seems so scarce in my seed earlier lol
as in higher likelyhood of certain ones showing up more given "haha lmao look its shuffled"
Need to go back for that GM BK I guess
ye but that woulda happened either way
you could do such a power play on rushing the OW hints banking on path hints if paths over woths KEKW
@Axl_SR you say that, if you dont start with any I am rather certain I get to 20 before 40m mark in maxshuffle barring keys p4ntzThink
like - they flyyyy by as a resource to collect
it definitely is a "yea this is a 1off"
that being said, I think I know I will be doing it at least one more time
because a couple peeps I know were thinkin about a multi zelda rando marathon as a derpy race between friends
what do you think of being able to set how many letters you need for parakarry check?
It was! How's the rando going
the funnies are not coming from the items though KEKW
Blue, the previous one was a 2:06:30
Haven't seen a seed since the update. What were they averaging before that?
this one is already off to a blazing start in my books
cus I mean - we know the dungeons without reading the wished for sign
That's a huge swing, sounds more fun
AND that is 3 paths to bosses
all missing now is BKs and go mode items yea - seed's wild at 20m in
hows that work? are there multiple bows?
its not like the bomb bags where each is unique
Nice to see a few TP randos
Its such a nice and chill rando to watch lately
Is there any cool new things in 1.2?
im going to bed have a good one
I think you want to walk instead of roll
its so weird the devs put a chest here that needs clawshot but its just like, rupees lmfao
def worth coming back here for
The middle of the bridge is the divide, so the stuff on the south side is Eldin Field
does the purple mist include the 2 chests in the cave in that area btw
Yeah it is the 5 checks
Dungeons belong to the "Dungeons" province
Hello! Thank you for purchasing me, a cheap worthless viewer to watch your stream!
@Feli_Heli was so confused at first OMEGALUL
I was like wait is there a ban chatter redeem or something NiceSoftlock
Finally got 100% in Wonder phanto274Smile
oh they made it to where the heart container isnt the dungeon reward anymore
You doing another? So far in
Tiers of the kingdom almost came close but is still doesnt feel like a zelda to me
got fucked on a gacha game tonight
hard pity for a 5050 lost then soft pity for the character no pulls left for her weapon Sadge
How do you get rid of spiders? Eh I blow them up
something good up ahead Sure game
Are double claws go mode a lot of the time?
Maybe Goron Mines claw hint was not for the boss lol
this week for destiny 2 grind sucks so tried
Imagine if normal zelda had a function where you can press a button and you'd change without having to ask midna
Doing this all with wooden shield
raiding Bedge sounds good to me
oh i know them never seen a stream from them tho
Gl I know you can't look at chat o7
oh yeah forgot he said that...GL my dude!
decided to do a sneak into Axl stream too :3
you sound like you have a cold btw...you alright?
You can also do it with a precise wolf jump
this might be no chat race
I look away for a few seconds and your shield is gone...
I did not know there were 2 fishing rods in the game....
yeah the normal one and the coral earring
OHH the coral earring is bait, I did not consider that a separate rod
Game: hey remember when you did this?
I'd probably be angry if it was actually here in hyrule castle
I think possibly Temple of Time,
Can ask another runner who finished?
I mean he already forfeited it so why not
apparently isaac is going to get rid of bk sanity
that was really my only problem with these settings
just because having to double dip dungeons all the time is dum
Got a link to the race room?
Thought to ask axl but it seems like he hasn't found it yet either
There was one inside a house at the lake
Or it looked like a lake
did you get the fishing rod from her
It was a heart piece on the couch
the other was one of the flying chicken checks
Idk the names of these checks lol
Oh did you do the balloon challenge for that bird?
There's a check that someone did where they flew to a chest with a chicken, and the first chest was a clawshot which let them get the 2nd chest above
One of those was a clawshot
lanayru spring outside hookshot chests ya mean?
not secure on them meself PrideLaugh
by tracker I see you sadly missed a clawshot?
Which one is goron spring water
after you pay off the bridge repair
Maybe I'm looking at a wrong vod? idk
Not the actual goron spring at death mountain?
And opened a chest at a castle
I never noticed they look at you when midna returns
Yeah it was the tightrope chest
because it spawns as you cross the rope lmao
Yeah that was the sign of it's fucked
ill forever read SCT as south clock town
i think its just all gold wolves but that one is free so i keep it on in my settings
I dont even know what SCT in TP would be KEKW
SHCT doesnt make it better either though
cus then strike the C = SnowHead Temple KEKW
you dont need fishing rods if you cheat
was confused since I thought I heard my name from you KEKW
I dare you to dance on camera
juuust gotta make sure that w path hints, bks if I understand hint placement and stuff right cant ever be on a path hint by themself cus they got their individual hints already
100 bits if you do :3
like - items leading to the BKs can be on path indirectly via the item
cus say clawshot to morpheel could still mean that the clawshot can be before lakebed BK
if the clawshot were the path item of a path hint to morpheel
I mean the GM chest kinda threw me off
yeaa its a bit roughie on depth
Goron Mines imo ois a bit worse
like - yea you're hunting your Small keys anyway
and then if PoT were to be a thing is also fine
ye where the solas would be needed to be brought to otherwise
HC BK is an OoTR form of glowmode in my books rn yea
like - I get the reasoning to an extent for forest temple
cus you normally end up routing towards east first with 1 monkey nothing, it IS reachable sphere 0
hear me out even better: just place it before you go up to the lobby stairs up to compass chest and monkeys and such
and Goron mines? before you do the fire switch run arguably even imo
cus doing that more then once is dumb
if next to them, then the first if you wanna still have minor work for it
just has to be early imo
but for a BK? too deep by a mile
at that point if individual dungeon BK hint signs are a hassle in depth based placement, either a) make it be very first room (imo) respectively each
isaac saying hes gonna use big keysy felihePausers
OOOOR similar to the ordon sign rn, link a specific sign to have all the BKs on it as much as that could be info overflow
Gonna go shower and refill meds...brb
like - if you wanna still keep a case of "Glow Mode" then BK shuffle ONLY for HC BK and not for the others
otherwise just make them not be a thing
not like they add much more then glorified walk ins and outs given OOccoo iss dummy
like - hear me out, if Ooccoo would be per dungeon settable and retrievable without risk of losing cus you fought a boss
minimum you could do the fight perma wolf -> human switcheroo
easy set => take Snowpeak, ToT, CitS imo and you got a decent spread of big / low extras
o7 and good luck on today's runs
cus anyso 50% chance for Irons, about? 50% for lantern, decent odds given bosses and respective options to need either bombs or ball&chain just for checks not to mention reaching / dealing with bosses
then add BKs and its 16/17 given settings w BKshuffle
unless I am dummy and its fused shards, either way its 1 +/- there
yeye I am thinkin in regards to BKs if they were anywhere there
for reference: MMR is rather rigid if you dont mess with the win cond at all
cus all elementals, bow, hook, all transforms, all the 2nd row songs
paper mario you gotta go 5 minutes back just to check 1 thing :(
and then ya add extras for song items, ya need magic
like - 13 go mode items sounds about avg for a Zelda give/take to me
like ah damn you really had to give me dolly NOW....
cus some games (lookin at you, windwaker) got crazy counts just because of progressive items
nah youre right its only really shitty when you gotta go back through chapters
cus WWR minimum Ganon go is Magic, 3 bows, 4 swords, Hookshot, grapple
and any and all dungeon related items + songs
well FF is a "dungeon" because it has map, compass, dungeon item in form of hammer, Heart Container KEKW
so in that regard 100% it is one
as much as I agree overall in it being an extended island moreso
yea THAT one I dunno chief KEKW
like - its a minidungeon in my head
yea check count to me doesnt count at all KEKW
cus if we go by that, hear me out
OoTR with MQ Well = Well is like 5 checks TOPS
vs non MQ well being 10+
like - check count does NOT play into my thought there KEKW
my thought goes "yea the tomb feels more like a indepth fight grotto"
the well in OoT is a minidungeon by definition
similar treatment for Ice Cavern and GtG
like - the reason FF counts as dungeon I think boils down to proper miniboss / boss there
and it therefore being an applicable spot for race mode "force a tringle piece there"
DRC, FW, TotG, FF, ET, WT
with ET and WT respectively being HAAAATED purely cus of the huuge escort portions
like - I'd rather command melody some statues in TotG then do that in ET / WT
I found south castle town tight rope so double clawshot was go mode LUL
at the same time Id rather deal with those over doin other things KEKW
ohhh I get now what happened >.>
damn that sucks i just got back
hear me out, might be a hot take
barren hints shouldnt be subregions within a bigger region imo UNLESS its distinct like say specific sections of Hyrule Castle town as an example
so I was like I havent touch north hyrule field so ill do that and tightrope, and if its not there its prob on morpheel. The pop off felt good
ahh ok so it was more interpreted wrongly
what was in ordon cause it wasnt hinted barren
I thought it was always hint barren
nah, if I got the barren / path hint stuff right, it sounds like race mode (from isaac a couple days back, grain of salt on my memory mostly there)
that its a somewhat fixed number on race gen for path /barren totals
w like 4 paths or so and similar ish barrens totals
what was the chain for that?
2 hours? I got about 2 minutes at max
did it come with extra fries at least
I have heard worse WotH chains in MMR phanto274Smile
Did you try going faster at least?
oh yeah, no way was I gonna dnf
and by "heard worse" I mean "played worse" KEKW
oh btw, I tried to fight fyrus with bomb arrows KEKW
oh, I couldve done it with normal arrows!?
I wouldve saved so much time
that just sounds like the type of fight you go for ONCE at most KEKW
like - how much damage is it total you need to deal?
and arrows deal minimal damage, no?
thinking about adjusting the dungeon logic, like the tracker says you need 3 small keys to fight fyrus, but you can do it with 2 small keys and clawshot for example
fuck that, thats definitely a 1 try and out
like how if you run out of magic on single bow in MMR v twinmold
you just end up chasing the 2nd one if you dont hit your snipes
I still had fun racing everyone, but half dnf was rough
LTTPR at LEAST NORMALLY has ease of access to potions
in MMR you dont have cash for potions EVER
like - you ONLY have cash for potions if you route cash for that over banks
me havin fought whats its face
You gonna do a MMR stream some time?
on green mail 3 hearts fighters only
cus stubborn and dumb on settings chosen
@AnniLyn2 if that happens, I happily teach along feli PrideLaugh
yea well - MMR does the same
technically MMR's twinmold logic is giant mask / Fierce Deity mask only
bows are just ALWAYS quicker to do the fight with
cus you WILL ALWAYS have those when you go there
and giants / Fierce Deity are massive fuckin ice rods
AFAIK dark world bosses for most dungeons require Master Sword
and the issue for that moreso with LTTPR is the fact that nintendo made the magic be so exact
for MS reqs last I recall its for Kholdstare onwards logic wise
so dungeon 5 to 7 in terms of vanilla crystal locales
truthfully the ONLY thing you could do for LTTPR to not always enforce such thing is to dip more dngeons before boss
vitty is the one I didnt renember the name of yea
what I would say makes LTTPR more cozy to play is if you start ith half magic and enable quarter magic existing
that way = no forced magic perfection on bosses at least
cus otherwise you at MINIMUM got kholdstare and trinexx being magic perfect
it is on the website, BUUUUT its also hidden behind shenanigans
so like... it definitely is a case of unless you know, you cant easily serch for it
cus you cant find the settings easily
there's like 5 pages you need to look at in order of finding the things
and even then you're not guaranteed to
the reason I know those types of things is bc I know peeps who did LTTPR for a WHILE as their main game for rando
and then knowledge sharing happened and so on
I went to add the 5 new checks to the tracker and it messed up the preset so I had to redo the blossom settings preset
hang on lookin at it on my end too
yea ok I see what you mean
I am spoiled by the AP implement of LTTPR
where stuff like having quarter magic enabled is easy to add to the pool
the best thing with LTTPR still HAS to be that hints are either single check hints or junk hints
and to me I ignore even reading them as its near always just joke hints
instead of "generate rando seed" -> "generate custom game"
and then there you add the quarter magic to the pool
you can add it to the pool
just that then you gotta take 1 junk item out or some such
so realistically you take out 1 ten pack of arrows
cus arrows WAYS easier to obtain to bombs early
and bombs are WAY more versatile
My reaction for finding snail was "oh nice! I have a hint for that" LUL
thats I think the only change
big keys were fine, its just we had to dip snowpeak locked behind D Rod
if it was like coro owl statue id forgive that but it was GD
imagine if this was secretly a plando KEKW
also I asked about 1.2... the rando getting into GDQ played a factor into time being dedicated for the changes in features. So if not for that we prob wouldnt have it right now
let phantom roll the seed next week LUL
WHERE WAS THAT HINT LAST SEED!?
I have a small dilemma, nothing serious:
got a voucher, was gonna get FE Engage, but it's on sale
speedrun communities when spike gets rando of their game in gdq: BabyRage
at least thats how it was for mm
it was actually cool imo though
i got some music i made for mmr in his seed
yea - I didnt hear negatives about MM being on GQD stage for rando with the 1.16 showcase stuff when it was tippiThink
musta not heard some stupid internet gremlin shenaniganry
it was just mm runners who were mad that rando got in but not the actual mm runs people submitted lol
thats such a nothingburger imo cus the game's still there
just cus that speciifc run wasnt (yes I get practice for the run and shit) but also like... its still about the game you like, no?
yeah but the mm community only cares about nmg and nothing else
and not about specifically ONLY the one way you play?
like... thats one thing I think I'll never understand
if a game has multiple ways of being played
it doesnt matter which way gets shown if the game in question gets shwon
mm has been in gdq a few times now, but i think people just want to see any% nmg get in again because its been so long
but I am simpleminded I get that tippiGiggle
Better than the response I got for zelda 2
"Thank you for using our submission feedback form! Regarding your request for feedback on your Zelda II: The Adventure of Link run, we do not feel that there was anything inherently wrong with your submission. Zelda is a competitive category of runs, and we picked other games for this marathon. We encourage you to keep submitting in the future."
There was 23849728342 different copies of Ocarina of Time submissions
And it was run at the previous GDQ
So it was just incredibly cringe lmao
WHY DO PEOPLE SUCK SO MUCH AT SONIC GAMES
I'm tired of seeing oot runs, just like i'm sick and tired of seeing Dread runs
It was a good game, don't get me wrong, but holy shit, let the game rest
Ice is dreading Metroid, got it
its like how the internet gremlins want silksong
How about save my fucking braincells
If I see one more run of Dread at a gdq in the next year, I'm going to climb a building and scream
anyway i think tpr will be fun to watch at gdq
but I dont feel like being the "mine mine mine" internet person whenever anything remotely close to silksong could happen KEKW
isnt TPR in as a Co-op?
at least gymnast can carry LUL
Dread runners be like "check out my cool speedrun" and does the same run, but slightly altered cause it's a slightly different category
This is NMG, i do like 2 different things than any%
i dont really know spike that well, does he run tp at all
hang on gotta reload again cus FFZ didnt load
L I T E R A L L Y me
what got eaten: wanted to say, I saw spike go live a couple times during the last week or so with TPR co-op
which to an extent imo also alleviates the need for skill if comms between the 2 people works fine
Oh phantom did you see the romhack of SMRPG that came out on the 6th?
It's the koopa bros + kooper
In a whole new game lol
are you gopnna join the tues race?
just saw the online mentions of him
and then hovering over seein the title
and from what I renember with MMR: gotta have people in the chat when he asks about strats mentioning where decent race legal strats exist
so that it comes up in his chat for learning
link has strong paws to grab that ledge while carrying midna LUL
lanayru field is just spinner check right?
like - as an example 1 thing with MMR when blitz became a thing and revven brought it up to spike in regards to tracker and small speed ups for things turned into him literally having a couple people mention strats again and again for a beginner friendly start
cus at the time MMR blitz was treated as THE beginner setting
You need swiss to run this rando on console, right?
as much as I personally would disagree with that given how low the time routing was for blitz overall compared to most MMR stuff
also phantom: how long does emotracker now exist?
I don't even know if my wii even functions properly anymore lmao
either way: we all know emotracker is like one of the first rando "has maptracker?" things for learning ppl look at unless other things get recommended
like - not just TPR pack but in general I mean
for me is more I already need it for GBi so why not
cus I renember distinctly that spike had to set up MMR in there specific to junked checks and shit each time
cus setting up a baseline "this is / is not needed" and saving that as a starting point like you have it for yourself rn with TPR is somethin which just never crossed his mind given all the other things he's doin KEKW
granularity in options for tricks for those who know what to look for and such
even if so far glitch logic for TPR might still be in a rough "template state" so to speak
GL Phan! might come back but have fun and possibly see you guys later evo17Hiyo evo17Banzai
ye I know that / had seen that on the discord mentions
just that obviously given the logic per check with options depending on how deep glitches can go
Did I make it in time or is me late?
its definitely harder to implement given the cases to respect in options and depending on how many different variants will end up getting looked at
like - you get the thought I am at right
yea I get that thats rough
but also even if thats a thing right
making logic work w that is rough
you can just do these 2 in 1 go?
I always thought you had to do 3 trips clawshotless
so when I was doing flight here I put on the magic armor to drain money for spring underwater checks and it gave me a damn silver ruppee LUL
you heard me mention I played MMR with glitched logic right
and by that I mean w weirdshots and shit
if I can do frame perfect weirdshots w jank emu pause buffers before any safer glitches options existed, surely I can get a chicken on a ledge and make it stay KEKW
like - that sounds EASY compared to weirdshots in MMR with their crash frames
granted yes this game runs at 60 right? so triple FPS
Yoo Phantom, good luck phanto274Smile str9ngLove
but also... eh - it will be noted down, surely it'll flow when I need it to KEKW
Hey its the clawshot from the race?
PhantomGamesBot: ye I'm a fucking geyser over my PB, so close to fking losing it. Their is not anyone who like doing ALL the glitches...
do you know Isaac's twitch? Id like to see how he handled the race
tbf, that checkbox is slightly hidden PrideLaugh
as in "its not front of title, game"
can we not scare the shit out of people by blending with solid rock walls pls KEKW
the pop in on that chest made me laugh during the race
that's where the clawshot was in the race
that HAS to have been hinted
yeah, phantom is replaying the race seed
except no BKs this time KappaPride
how is shooting the clawshot not slowed down underwater?
@Iceblue just shuffle boss themes, easy
blizetta to the stallord 2nd round theme sounds godly in my head
agithas castle theme would drive me insane more
you're talkin to someone who has had OoTR with market theme on final ganon WAY too often
its a staple of silly bogus dumb shit
that was the sound i put into mmr that was in spikes gdq rando
like - dont ask me how, I blend those super annoying themes out somehow
the most annoying I had in an MMR seed with custom music was a benny hills like theme on final hours
and I had things to do in final hours
so I couldnt just cycle away from it
like... I take star minigame loop over that ANY time
peach slide is superbly annoying KEKW
The most cursed shit I've ever played
and I dont want to say your taste should be my taste there PrideLaugh
I did the custom musi9c in dk64
just that I for myself cant see the star minigame be as shitty as other stupid nonsense I have ran into already
persona 5 in there is so wild to me
@Axl_SR the DK64 soundbanks give a LOT of good options, I aint even surprised it works
it would probably be harder to put music into tp since i dont think the game uses basically just midi like oot/mm do
I mean even if it does, importing it could also either a) be unexplored or b) be different / harder
if ONLY Ooccoos would be per dungeon...
its mentioned on the TPR wiki that any Ooccoo will munch any other Ooccoo if you pick another up elsewhere
when Link is handing from the megnet here, he sure does have a strong grip on his hylian shield LUL
hell, make it be a specific slot in the inventory by item type to switch between gotten Ooccoos
even if the dungeon is clear
then pickin them up wouldnt feel as trashy as it does
and similarily, you could route dungeons diff
especially with these medium deep dips
I did not know that ladder exists
thought sling was literally only for wall creeper spiders
these 3 got huuuge sniper aims
their bros from ANYWHERE else are trash compared
it was kinda cool to join a race with more than 4 people LUL
why did you leave it in the desert Kappa
Just learned today Multiversus locked unpurchased characters for local play so the chances for a competitive scene for the game are dead
this first check here, did you know you can reach it from epona? use bomb arrows and clawshot can reach the vines
i feel like epona isnt really fast for most situations
unless youre going like all the way across hyrule
I dont get how the skulltulas in this game could become so resilient to takin damage truthfully
like - sure, they got adjusted
but they got adjusted too much defensively imo - too much waiting if you dont have anything to knock their face out of focus for a sec
OR though mroe time investment for them - runnin away cus when they're crawlin towards you they're not set on defenses at least
upper desert is anything before the "lowered" half towards AG section?
if the seed would enforce a double dungeon dip for go mode in the 3rd dungeon of the game before the others
like - at this point this seed is carrot on a stick KEKW
if ONLY per dungeon Ooccoo.... papeHands
this isnt pro skater, no sick tricks matter but speed
we know where ball and chain is, no?
I was thinkin that hin ye just wasnt sure if it had huge specifics or not
hey thats a doable dungeon, no? KEKW
I at this point want to know where the fuck your bow is KEKW
cus MAN its hiding somethin fierce that one
I dont think that first bomb was links fault
I think that was the moblin or whatever its called
snipin the arrow cus it missed you
those subregion things to my head dont make sense much
definite welcome back to rando chose violence electric boogaloo
it could just be learning how the hints work yea
Wait did you start a new one?
yep this is a 2nd go round
dont think race included, just a 2nd go round
otherwise I wouldnt be meme talkin about items
yea I get what you're talkin about
like... to me, those subregion hints sound interesting on paper
but until there's a definition of which checks that respectively targets somewhere, I personally would just straight up ignore them
cus this game doesnt have a bajillion extra doodle items yo ucould pck up
and I only rly trust barren / foolish and path / woth / specific hints really as those tend to be non questionable hint types
whenever its a subregion style thing, I kinda blank out on it personally
am I silly w that? definitely
Shared something in #rando. Someone shuffled 24 bugs and she has so much stuff it runs of off agatha's sign LUL
I need to see that garbo
I should NOT have said a thing earlier about the silly bogus this seed could be doin KEKW
boomerang I think you found in mines?
what do you need lantern for rn
I think logical speakin cus something was in lantern cave?
and castle town is not part of lanayru despite where its at?
what about star game 2nd round?
wait a sec... that underwater chest, cnat you break the boards by rolling with iron boots?
not as far as I would think of it
I know rolling gives it a hitbox
I mean... you do have a bow... might as well clear that out no? or would that mess with ooccoo?
if this is a hardlock lantern seed on no lantern dungeons KEKW
honestly I'd rather see full dominion rod in GM at that point
just to spite lantern and its UBER usefulness for checks
yea this feels like no FW forest temple triple dips in OoTR
if Ooccoo would be either an FW case OOOR better, a per dungeon case of how it functions, it would definitely help this scenario QoL wise
though I get that Ooccoo more then likely is that one item which is bleh to deal with
some days rando just chooses violence PrideLaugh
if this were a bug it would be funky
cus your first bow was behind clawshots which are behind lantern
Did you play both star games?
my guess would go towards MAYBE some bug check being something but unpeeked
or hell maybe that kak gorge hint is funky, I got no clue rly
Wait what are you looking for?
or something in lanayru to have ball&chain
behind 2nd goron with the sign
just sayin in terms of potential path thoughts there
so your kak path to whatever was the auru stuff
soooo maaaybe in Snowpeak towards miniboss as that has options to not be ball&chain locked?
1 was in Desert, the other I think was behind spinner?
aurus memo was kak underwater chest
To the desert then or no memo yet?
this is currently recollecting the seed by what happened
which during a race obv would be done by the player alone, not w someone else talkin too KEKW
but at this point I am intrigued and derp
plus this isnt a seed being raced
soooo I kinda am sittin here bein like "well half a working extra braincell cant hurt"
like - what I dont know is if Kak gorge means the entire kak gorge field or just the gorge itself
just wasnt certain whether that was a subregion or full region type hint
and like - the pumpkin would give you access to the midboss section of snowpeak no?
its pumpkin -> cheese -> BK no?
not 100% hence the dummy double check ask there
and from this side the ice library maze is also doable since you get access to a cannon and a cannonball
as annoying as that room is w/o ball&chain
it would be suuuuuper silly if all the bugs or the required one is here to haul back for lantern for some lantern check in lanayru KEKW
the other you want is I think straight first to clear and get easier path back
I knew that was gonna happen...idk how
then slightly right diagonal after (aimed at the outside of the dungeon) to get clear paths
like - that 2nd chest is superbly shite to aim for w the cannon
but I think you can get that?
last night I played a seed til 4am, gonna try to get my sleep schedule back lol
No that's ball and chain ice idea
yeah, I wanna be in bed before midnight
i noticed that in the race too
so there's work towards ManChicken QoL but at the same time, its not yet done... >.>
gotta go by slightly closer on the rooll I guess
thats at least what I renember from when you were practicing the Any% of this
not that I'd know what a save "close enough" is
at least that skips the 2nd dominion rod
is Ooccoo back in the pot?
Was gonna say see if she's in the kitchen again
cus yea this lines up with Ooccoo weirdness shite
may you yet again be a worse FW
literally my reason to straight up ignore Ooccoo's existence for dips as when dips happen, you are mostly treckin back in anyway
cus logic ends up doin that at times anyway
bow behind zora armor which was where?
and then the double fishing rod to get a bug to get lantern to do lantern lanayru for ball&chain
not to mention either double dominion rod or snowpeak miniboss on ordon sword for MS
lantern cave midway chest could still be
then I think North Lanayru hyrule field skulltula lantern chest?
this butterfly havin been in snowpeak was pretty not nice (pun intended) game KEKW
cant think of many - shellblade hint was found right?
agitha is just like what any MM mask check would be
if those extra items wouldnt exist, the problem would just be very minutely diff
snowfield counts as snowpeak region or also lanayru?
and malo mart shop item is also dedge
if this was ball&chain all along it would be super silly for lantern logic KEKW
the reason I thought lantern cave is bc before you get the sign you got 1 force lantern chest
ball&chain was hinted in lanayru region
and a hint lying would be a big "well oops bug"
which granted, its early for hints being there, but also bets its not broken
desert is also its own region?
cus I am not certain on you havin been in there to check that and sign
that is lanayru but hinted ded
I want to see this KEKW
doesn't Iza has 2 checks? One for helping her and one for playing minigame?
you could not throw this up on here for us to see right? tippiGiggle
I think you ran past that every time you were there
when towards the underwater chest you werent close to it I dont think
hang on when did you start this?
around 4:30 uptime to 5hrs right?
I definitely think you had irons early
yeye no clawshot or rang I know that
just curious if we saw that and it just blanked or whether based on potential seed bleed you ended up just runnin past that PrideLaugh
though AT LEAST it only was a logical lantern
Sorry if I asked before...I dont have the best memory
you're giving me anxiety playing near the edge like that
yea ok so at the 30m mark of this seed, you were reading chat ant huggin wall to underwater chest in north hylia / lanayru field
it baaarely was visible and not easily recognizable when watching to be a ball&chain
cus when you went towards lantern skull lantern grotto you also definitely rushed past lefthand side
I mean - I normally dont get seedbleed much
before you went and checked you were contemplating kak and then went back to it after checkin ZD hints
like - 20m mark you were HC / market / whathaveya and south field
but to the derp I was tryin to talk about: I usually dont get seed bleed, but had a case of "lets peek this tree" in road to southern swamp MMR
it was something blue green grey ish, I chalked it off as bombchu
turns out it was deku mask
or another where I thought its a blue rupee
turns out it was ice arrows
like - some peeks I in that game either gave up on or started doing intently just so that its clear that its what I saw it is
and w the shimmer the bug checks got in this, its VERY easy to mispeek I feel like KEKW
3rd round would be going into delirium KEKW
the bug checks are also rly not bad imo
as in both the pick ups and turn ins
just that for the pick ups, you HAVE to peek intently
You use to find a lot lolz
I get that, but (call it being accustomed to it) so are Mask uses in MMR PrideLaugh
or say from spider houses there
which if you know they're a good thing, you also know its 5min minimum on good routing and execution
so like... some things just are a thing I feel like
I would honestly test roll a couple seeds just to see if you still need to pick up and care about jovani
cus if he's now forced vanilla, then its a big maybe if you even wanna do that
even if its 4 poes max to collect (bets its cus of AG being a thing)
ok so then maybe keep an eye out for seeds where if his bottle ends up being vanilla
whether his house sign just says his house's name
so "junk" turns that into "jovani's house" is your thought?
honestly for jovani I just wanna hear the sign always state the item/s he's givin out no matter junk or not
in rando you should know where he's at and dont need knowledge on his name KEKW
and to an extent I by this point also am spoiled by OoTR / MMR having "in house" hints aka the respective skulltula rewards stating their items by talking to them
or in MMR's case where applicable cus vanilla you see an item on them, you seeing replaced item models
Bad luck is a better word
and this seed can go in the gutter with its funky ass lantern logic for clawshot KEKW
lantern musta been sphere 4 or 5
when was the lantern cave clawshot?
logic wanted you to get the rods
so you could get a bow up here
so you can then return do GM and then get your clawshots
thats a wild logic trip KEKW
and honestly understandable given the other 2 bow placements
the desert sword never came up in spheres I hope?
yea you'd be better off fighting the ball&chain thingy whatsitcalled
you had a lower desert hint
will definitely need to check on that PrideLaugh
has to be aurus memo yea
cus aurus locked a fishing rod
so you could get to snowpeak
on one of the dayfly checks
sounds like path hints to me
hence why I personally (even if slightly more cryptic) prefer woths
like - the path hints can be literally that in OoTR as well
vs WotH = "is this item woth? go down all checks behind it"
like - path hints are really nothing more then "directed" woth
and you can easily get chain roped by that
as much as technically speaking, "woth should not lead to chains"
as its been said in MMR so often I just giggle at it every time I get a seed which has a big ass chain of items behind a single woth hint
you're mentioning the reason I love gossips tracker rly PrideLaugh
hence my curiosity on hint stuff rn
cus w gossips, I need to just know the regions
then how many woth / fool
or path if thats chosen over woth, its just a diff word for the same hint type
then I can drag the items over to it cus it has items and notepad in one
the problem I could see with TP is given bugs, I technically would need ALL of the bugs on the tracker
so I can mark the right bug to the right thing
and then turn them in correctly
cus its not like a poe soul counter but more like the PM64 letter checks
its the ONLY hinderance I rly see with TPR yea
cus with Ooccoo's current state, you got no safe warp back
BEEEEG hope that Ooccoo gets turned into a per dungeon Ooccooo
hell could color them or name them per dungeon
decouple Ooccoo from being lost on dungeon clear
cus you dont full clear a dungeon necessarily when you beat the boss
and that particularily helps BK anywhere stuff
last dungeon pre HC to get HC BK hint
--> fuck its the dungeon you go moded
and arguably CitS is the best to get back to KEKW
Lakebed, GM, FT are worse backtracks
sorry for ramble from me alone though
so i converted your script into linux commands and accidentally discovered something about the relpatcher lol
so if you have more than 1 seed in the seed folder, it will make 1 iso that has all the seeds on it
and you can pick the seed when you launch the iso
when you start the iso a menu pops up telling you to pick which seed you want to play
so in theory you could make a bunch of seed and play them all without needing to copy the rando over and over
i didnt know you could do that with wolf too
hope all is well, this seed so far not throwin curveballs PrideLaugh
medium curveballs given the dungeons already
even if - I meant more the rod then the bow KEKW
cus at least the bow is still valuable for combat outside of GM
why we happy about beetles this early in a seed?
yea I reckon its a case of nice to have type of item
cus you could use 1 rod to cheese final dork
or at least it sounds / feels that way to me rn from sound
it got that whole "MMOoTR, purple rupees and up are nice to have items" written all over it
where its literally just rupees cus rupee farming in OoT and MM respectively without tools sucks a smidge on speed
how does agitha work w this anyway?
it is still per bug item or is it a count style "pool" of items?
ok so like if the entire pool were shuffled
those positions you're needed to stand in here look rather cozy to eyeball for lanayru outside hook chests
guess the hardest part is not to scare the chiggle
my bigger problem most likely would be holding up too long / short for the upward KEKW
at boss shuffle path hints would have to be towards dungeon
"why is iron boots path to AG? OHHH cus its FYRUS at the end!"
anyhow: is the beta / 1.2 stuff "open testing" or closed testing?
dev only lists 1.1 though p4ntzThink not 1.2
when you click on it, it turns into 1.2
I see what my mistake is
I try to go to tprando itself
but the link for the 1.2 is slightly diff
kiinda sad (though understandable) that hints arent yet customizable
how did I miss the go live?
but yea thought = me go roll like 4 to 5, skim logs, then figure out a way to get all the bug icons without the butterfly icon
and THEN get that butterfly icon out separately as a checkmark icon since gossips
ah yea I found the menu
thats what I thought but couldnt get a answer
"blossom" is the setting you're rollin seeds with unless race seeds then I reckon?
going out of the way for a single hint KEKW
not just hint I think axl
yep not just hint KEKW hooly this is cursed if its real
but ye Imma assume outside of possible changes to it, given that if / when any season based hint selection is getting set, rn one could at least get a rough idea of whats cookin w blossom
did you get bomb bag to snail yet?
why did the Bluepee give you bombs
@Feli_Heli is there also feelsBluepeeMan? tippiGiggle
you got what you wanted, dont complain LUL
anyhoo I think once I manage to accidentally again crash FO4 by playing it normally (cus bethesdumb games SMILERS ) I need to figure out how the bug icons work
is there any bug which is distinctly off the butterfly icon / separated from it which you could think of?
pillbug could be one such bug, no?
I also need to come up with a good "gossip stone icon" for the gossips given its tp
they picked 4 sphere bugs, and 4 that require items like the sacred grove bug
@Axl_SR thats not what I'm on about tippiTap
axl for explanation: with MMR, I tend to like playing it with just an item + hint tracker combined
and given I am mostly secure on checks barring grottos, I wanna try and get myself to a point of using an item + hint tracker rather then map tracker
Gossips is one such tracker ye
latest version I could recommend you could find by goin after the forked version of DK64Rando
cus it took Gossips HD and made it more "overall use" w changing layouts and such
per item textfields if one wanted to
like - for MMR, I play solely w that, not w a maptracker at all
and now that TPR has itself a hint system which - you know - is usable
while not being as scatterbrained a task to say WWRando is
how Gossips in general works => you feed it a json with the possible always, sometimes hints and regions
then you give it a panel for the Path/Woth hints
and per sometimes/always either go with icons or textfields to type it out
and ya tie gossip icons to drag items on top of to the always/sometimes, as the woth panel in it has them built in
why the hell did I get signed out of twitch?
rly all I'd need to figure out is the item icons
anyone remember what my password is?
anyhow: long story short, I overall prefer hint over maptrackers myself, cus its 1 less window open and less screen estate used overall - just that obv. for learning, map trackers are HIGHLY better
I have been marking off dungeon checks
^ I do that overall w maptrackers
i know all the checks in tp but i still use the map tracker to remind me of them tbh
I am a crazy person though - you know the whole F11 to see all checks? tippiGiggle
--> me sees everything always even if I cant do it
so when I dont cross shit off, at some point its cluttered as shit
anyhoo: w gossips since obv. so far I bet no one has made a pack, and I like my self brewed layouts, I could just go and mess with that
ooooor as the smarter way for myself - I could look at how gossip funcs and set myself to writing a similar tool in java since Gossips is exe only
cus gossips afaik currently is windows only, cus exe and exe is slightly hassle like for linux / mac
then from there obv. next step would be making proper sense of github stuff so that it does make sense for me to derp around like that
cus like - to my knowledge anything tracker related so far hasnt come with a "build your layout" feature in a "non text editing" way?
for the likes of setting pins up in editing mode or items
I wouldnt even call that misplay rly, just routing decisions
also ik that java isnt necessarily everyone's cup of preferred shit tippiGiggle its just comin to mind as the easiest to pack up'n "work" for anything rly given jar files
could you not go backwards to deathsword within race allowed tricks?
deathsword w/o way to deal w stalfos
my brain => go backwards since there's funky ways to get to BK chest bakwards
well there ya go, funky way to deathsword exists
and all stalfos in here skippable
unless I am dummy and one of them spawns a chest
isnt there 1 stalfos before a poe
low% strats in a rando race would be funky
i wonder if you could lja to the other door here
ohh phantom needs to update his chat for on scene tippiGiggle
me over here wondering why Voids and Bluepee arent showin
anyhoo I mentioned I wanted to play FO4 til it inevitably crashes right KEKW
yet here I am typin up storms and not lurkin CorgiDerp
i gotta start learning all the ljas tbh
and super free to learn rly
but as a glitchless runner idk many inside dungeons lmfao
i do know the one thats allowed in this one though
well - if you know like Kak gorge double clawshot HP chest LJA and say, Eldin bridge Owl skip LJA as examples
I am relatively certain yu got the 2 most commonly found distance types of LJA down then
just a matter of respectively angles and where to aim at
need a playlist of every lja in tpr
I dont think that exists yet KEKW
I tried to but didnt find such a list
there is a switch in this room
there is a switch to turn off the wind across where you sidehopped
but I cant ever fuckin renember where
like - the sidehop iron boots is just sooo freee to do
aka "knowing the room" feli? KEKW
now idk how youre gonna do this
You can equip IB late into your jump toward the guy
though HEAR ME OUT super silly idea
"worm has too much to lift, got a neckache"
i wonder if chest size will ever be a setting
CSMC is such a "spoiled" type setting though KEKW
sooo we're playing the danger plays now, hoping to just run into rang? KEKW
ohhh there was a good thing in AG?
you know - with the use of double clawshot KEKW
For rando you can leave the boots on the entire time
yeah you gotta go from the very right
Oh damn midna bs a mommy in secret
still haven't beat the new destiny 2 raid SadgeBusiness
Are you playing every  Zelda game in order?
youre a reset button on the wii
rando marathon but 3d zeldas... p4ntzThink
where it makes sense obv. - so not like skyward sword mostly cus setting that up = pain if you dont have a console on the ready for it
@Jonxhas good thing sshd rando came out a couple days ago
if ONLY that'd also get rid of say my personal problem in that case of not having a controller with gyro KEKW
but ye that'd be a helpful cause there as much as Skyward sword imo is less interesting rando-side
cus its so SUPER segmented compared to even Windwaker with the islands
SadgeBusiness still have no checks in alttp
locked out of kak side dark world need hookshot or glove upgrade or cheat with mirror
heard about the now "newest" CoD assumed install size? KEKW
its literally past the size of what formerly was a fine size for a boot ssd
good thing i don't like cod
also XBox comin out with "digital only" X/S series now while IN THE SAME SENTENCE mind you! sayin "ohh yea haha lmao we care for game preservation"
like - HOW do you even wanna make that make sense KEKW when DISKS EXIST ALREADY
you threw her baby on the ground
i also have the stream version but never play it KEKW
yeah modern discs just give you a download to the game
to an extent? I get it BUUUUUT its still nonsense given XBox series X/S could load XBOne titles too no?
want to know how the day 1 raid race went this weekend deadMario
what I am tryin to get at is more that XBOne games on disk were still read from disk, no?
like weaker than the xbox one x?
@Feli_Heli if so, most likely cus cooling
not enough room to vent out the heat
tldr: fuck Triple or hell, QuadA, stick with indie
cus apparently Indie still knows that you do not ALWAYS have to bloat your software beyond belief
buying a xbox in the 1st place is a scam just buy a pc you can play way more stuff KEKW
ill just play mm and tp forever
see you SAY that phantom KEKW
BUUT (this being another sick funny) within their announcement stuff today I SWEAR half of the games were "oh buy gamepass pls dont buy game buy gamepass let us scam you!"
gamepass just needs to die out ye
lots of devs get scam with gamepass since they have no choice when they out of money and Microsoft give them some to finish the game
why buy new game when you can just play rando of old game
at least this means a CONSCIOUS peek KEKW
oh on laptop so late responses for a bit
@Feli_Heli cus rare case, its a game like tunic
interesting seed w the paths I feel like tippiGiggle
like - I only have seen tunic to an extend
but also like - its a) a cute artstyle which looks fine and b) looks cool in gameplay + puzzles
I assume you said hi I heard part of my name then pope got bits
i played tunic with free gamepass
If you L-walk directly forward, he will jump
oh! silly question given I dunno what all is on the "possibly ends up happening" for TPR isaac if its ok to ask?
is there any thought towards Ooccoo being rando viable or nah? p4ntzThink
ik if so obviously long ways out given I can only imagine Ooccoo shenanigans is fucked to work with
Ooccoo could maybe be randomized at some point, but that is problematic right now since they overwrite each other
and if that were to ever happen, a "per dungeon" Ooccoo would be roughy too?
Is this seed 2 or 3 btw?
Yeah I definitely want that for Ooccoo. It should happen eventually
Was ooccoo ever fixed after him deleting himself at snowpeak yesterday?
as said, I 100% get that Ooccoo is more then likely a hassle and a half to get "rando right / QoL right" with the post dungeon "loss" for them and the flags tied to them on a semi-global basis
I sense sarcasm but unsure lolz
The other thing is we will need to store the stage/room/etc. data for every single one. There is only one slot which is why they overwrite each other
and makin sure that the game a) behaves fine on console as well as b) doesnt overwrite other important stuff
cus just from the bits I saw in regards to how FW in OoT works for vanilla v for rando, that already sounds like a pain and a half and its not even tied to finding it per dungeon or setting + leaving, changing the item in the menu as well as then respecting each dungeons "where we at"
as much as Gamecube has more then likely more overall options available, I can only assume that its still a somewhat similar mess PrideLaugh
I mean - suuurely its fish oil in that bottle, no? KEKW
thanks for the answer on random question isaac! PrideLove and hopefully no stress felt cus of it bein asked
Surprised your sword doesn't catch fire stabbing those
Btw, the Jovani check is just unhinted, not guaranteed dead. I am going to update the text to make it more clear in the game
OoT / MM have made me so paranoid that an explosion offscreen wouldnt do things KEKW
If you could use the boomerang on yourself... that'd be sweet af
You ever just find a sword floating next to a bridge
I think it literally is Big Baba
If you already beat the dungeon, idk how they work
I think you need lantern to get up there
The CitS ooccoo only takes you back to the shop
wanted to say, logic in this dungeon can if at all be single clawshot towards double clawshot chest
it rained earlier, felt so good since it's been so hot .. how's your day been? phanto274Smile
Yo, Phantom. Yo, chat. How's it going? phanto274Smile

Oh boy back from my tech check with GDQ just in time for argorok
Ordon sword it's what, 5 cycles?
I ran the big keysy, I had a clawshot on goat and there was no hint for it phanto274D
I got a 3:55 so 20 minute PB over yesterdays race, but lets be real that race should count KEKW
sky was loaded, I went west and found my hinted ball and chain and lantern and randomly found boomerang. Found argorok and dipped. Turns out the east side was junk lol
I didnt even go that far lol
like if I find 3 progression items the run will prob be junk
That ain't a boss key wtf
Oh boy it's argorok time again
The only boss in this fight is the time it takes for argorok to die

Ice rod is always in TR
ice rod = an item that can pretty much be everywhere excluding what it locks (granted, it locks an entire region here, BUT given there's 2 rods its not excluding anything which isnt hinted ded
But it has sand I hate sanddddddddddddddd

I just realized I'm gonna be content great
this seed sounds like some proper shenanigans is what it sounds like
oh wait, yeah that was for us
how bad are BK chests in the respective dungeons? p4ntzThink
no I mean the vanilla ones
just curious cus MMR plays rando on race settings with Small keysy and BK vanilla
could swap the rupee and BK chest there to elim that
Snowpeak is not bad, ToT is a bit of a treck midway up?
anyhoo: gl w the seed tippiTap
imma fix more of my FO4 settlements
hope ur well! i just got off work and im waiting for my chicken to marinate phanto274Smile phanto274Smile
we only got up to 69 today, its been a shockingly cold day today
sorry I’ve been lurkin lol I love the music in her room
imagine Malo Mart as the Hyrule Field theme
are you saying thats a bad thing
my wife on the other hand...
might as well be 100% in Fire Emblem
back from picking up my car
I take it BK in own dungeon?
After you turn to wolf, you are supposed to use L to straighten the camera
Soooo I might be coming back to pape (fr this time) lol
I'll have to see what i'm able to do after my shoulder surgery tho
my any% pb is actual trash tho
it's like a 1:51:12 on the old pre-seed dupe route
LJA to chest in the Beside Castle Town zone
There is a bomb boost at Great Bridge of Hylia, but you have to specifically learn it
Didn't know Alfredo sauce had lactose
You barely move the crosshairs down, but you target on the far wall. You can LJA some of the other chests as well
Yeah I learned the worst way ever
interesting thing from last nights seed. was hinted dominion rod not required but the spheres got it for the sword
Required or not is only used on the really bad checks. If it is not specified, then it is not specified.
I got a hint for zora armor, was nice to know I could skip lake alcove chest
so if I’m right all your stuff is just in random chests?
so like its impossible for zora armor to be in lake bed temple for example
last night I was in snowpeak, I found wood shield in a chest and the very next chest had hylian shield lol
Such odd placement for that axl lolz
well snowpeak was barren, I was just looking for small keys
last night I for the life of me could not remember where this next spinner check was
only dungeon I can route is goron KEKW
Kinda just wing it half the time
i forgot how to get the other chest close by
It is better to void a bunch intentionally since the peahats are fast when the room first loads
You can LJA from the corner next to the chest here
if a viewer redeems a seed in the stream, and no viewer is around to view it, does it still seed?
CitS should leave your SPR ooccoo alone btw
something I didnt think about until know, do we have to find all 3 BK in goron?
Still start with 2. All 3 does is make it more likely you have to full clear
just cast your line up there Kappa
its a bug to report KEKW
bruh... gamecube draw distance is ass
more like fog effect is funky
yeah, the end of a cliff
like - it actually takes skill to do that
anyhoo on my way to insanity w the fallout 4 settlement system rn
you know - its great when bethesdumb always creates a buggy mess to be fixed by the community
for explanation: FO4 has a settlement system w provisioner traderoutes between them
aaaand sometimes (more like often) you get phantom supply routes
because its great when you re-assign a settler but it doesnt reassign properly
and the ONLY universally doable fix is to have an extra settlement
and then do some funky double menu bullshit to send settlers around, create supply lines and immediately assign the settler in question to something else
do you have any snowpeak hints?
which once you have a phantom supply route is a 50/50 of you gettin the right one moved KEKW
Link needs a white canee LUL
quick someone play song of storms
have you played this game before?
honestly given you dont see the path
Link has a purple shirt phanto274Pog
if so, you'd have to time rang over the waddle platforms no?
gonna do AP wish me luck
Uh oh... what did I miss?
The one that had nothing beyond this point sign
It was in a different seed when mentioned something good
Idk if signs are really helpful seeing as some are misleading and some convoluted
You suspected double dipping for city
did all my checks, all I found was koover letter, stepswrd N, BambooSwrd N, GigFldr1, red boomerang, and oaks parcel
I havent touched it in over a week and this is all I got
I can at least go back to lilycover and catch 2 of my legends. Ive had old sea map and aurora ticket since early on
Ive yet to have a seed I could do that on
For people that never played pokemon. We have Lusamine and Cyrus... one is a 27 year old that kinda hates their life, the other is a 40 year old parent whose children ran away with their life's work. Anyone care to guess who is who? Cheer100
To be fair, Cyrus does have that 40 year old jaw line KEKW
Only hearing the I can base off of that
Most likely the requirement would involve lantern checks?
That happened a lot during my normal playthroughs
Supposed to hit daibaba but then would just shake a bit and I'd get the bomb...
Oh the mention of ranch makes me want wings...
Maybe behind the like like look alike
Gotta see what you got lolz
Forever waiting on Anni to run Zelda rando
She has tons of time to do it while i work from 8am-4pm, Js
and i have the TPR site up
perfect timing! Thats when I work from home and have no one to watch LUL
Well Axl... I'll practice rando lolz
Don't be nervous! You'll do great
Wasn't gorge barren? Or was that last seed...
thanks for showing me that sign
Any tips when I do try? I'm only use to vanilla areas
you said yours is in emotracker now, right?
Yeah I have no idea how to do glitches so...
the master sword now gives 2 new checks but that is only in 1.2
the new kakariko malo mart checks too?
yes, it shows in the spoiler log now
red potion and wood shield was added
I dont think it is yet, but it is planned. That why Isaac excluded it. Rip off the bandaid now before it gives too many extra spherre zero checks
yeah, to keep settings easy to remember
buying bombs to sell bombs to buy bombs is like paying taxes with money that was already taxed LU
Anni, when you play this good luck finding this grotto KEKW
I never knew about either of the grottos xD
I'm still trying to learn LJA... suck at it
the first grotto I found casually was sacred grounds. Its pretty obvious cause you go into sense for the poe and the digging zone is right there
Definitely practicing before streaming...I dont wanna look stupid evo17Wut
I just jump in head first
Komari stayed at an air bnb and logged into twitch from the TV, forgot to log out so had to log out from all devices LUL
if he isnt home he could save money but turning off the electrical and water until he gets back Kappa
He can save money by switching to geico
how old is TP rando cause i see youtube vods from 2022
I thought you were going to sleep LMAO
I see a comment saying depending on your settings you may need MS to enter ToT. You know what thats about?
i saw him in the mm server a couple days ago asking about some stuff and i was like "oh no"
my only experience with linkus was watching a vod on youtube. He was doing TP comentary I think it was a new route or something
Better than having an unhinged community that goes after people that don't agree with the big creator
the vod was about breaking TP HD
ive heard of people not liking him, but from when i watched him he seemed ok
he also only did no resets
all it takes to get good is to go insane a little
soon perhaps with tp hd on switch felihePausers
that could happen if they port it to switch KEKW
There's no way the ending blow is faster than slashing it
as long as they keep releasing N64 roms we will never get OoT and MM remakes
we already have oot and mm remakes
We don't NEED oot and mm remakes
oots is good and mms is bad
And it was disgustingly fucking broken
By that thought...ALBW shouldn't have gotten a remake
As long as they fix hinox warp
i never noticed the la remake being broken casually
Oh good I haven't missed stallord
Yeah Feli, the hinox warp was actually found by a casual reddit user lmao
They posted this clip on reddit and the speedrun discord went nuts
Where they got grabbed and took damage on the same frame by the hinox in Eagle Tower
And got thrown into the instrument room LMAO
surely not allowed in glitchless though right
It's a 33% chance of getting the correct throw
The bomb is out of bounds :) :) :) :) :) :)
At least you never had to learn D7 hinox warp
Double frame perfect with NO visual cue cause link is FLASHING
i feel like something like that should be considered a glitch
Nah we didn't consider the angle skewing and bomb boost in d4 a glitch
It's an abuse of mechanics at best
We had a 1700 message convo about d4 bomb jump lol
you should see glitchless lullaby skip in mm phantom
It was a bunch of people whining that if it was banned, they'd leave lmfao
LAS has some whiny ass people
Take it from me, I've modded the community since 2019
d4 bomb jump is literally only used in glitchless LUL
Every other category does bomb floating
AD Restricted, with it's 2 runners
Bomb floating is banned cause you can't walk on dungeon walls
I haven't looked at that discord in like 2 years
With D2 having a 33% chance to give you the correct throw to instrument room
Then double frame perfect no visual cue hinox warp in D7
I don't like adding a category that bans literally 1 trick
and now that category is super dead and no one runs it
The amount of abuse I got as a mod in the LAS community was wild lmao
Did I ever tell you about that Phantom?
The abuse started when some dingus submitted a run that was faster time than me, but he had really shitty audio that was hyper delayed, and he was playing some dog ass music in the background that covered the game audio
And he and his 6 friends came into the discord and started mega pinging me telling me that I declined it because it was a faster run than mine
I was like buddy, I don't give a fuck about my time
Your game audio was literal shit
And our rules stated the audio had to be clear
He's just incredibly shitty and toxic
Looks like he didn't have it blue
Stallord boss theme is like Molgera in WW for me
I don't watch WW speedruns :)
There will be no F's in chat
I will not pour one out for Makar
Harbored one of the WORST dungeons in the game
I think you need 2 logically
I got the wings anyway lolz
Where the hell do you live when wings are 40$??
Delivery fee + wings and tip
Okay bww and wingstop make sense
But no go on dominos and... finness?.. the system
Dominos wings are so unsatisfying unfortunately
I don't like their pizza much... and the sauce sometimes disappointing
Pizza hut pasta use to be amazing
It's really too bad that pizza hut quality has plummeted to below ground level
i used to like pizza hut SadgeBusiness
Feli walked in at a weird time
They somehow made their pizza dryer than the sahara
Their pizza was so greasy and soft with crunch
So like... does anyone know what stallord is? Stalfos are dead soldiers...so wtf is stallord
I wanna punch you so bad lolz
It's just described as an ancient beast...but man
You're not staying in my room for GDQ
its so silly how little damage things in tp do
Gonna need a lot of tp after GDQ
not gonna lie, the new shadow gameplay looks lit AF
Shadow Generations so far seems like "Yeah, this is the game we should've made back in 2005, but we were too busy catering to the stupidest kids on the planet"
You should be able to smash that
Impressions on it seems more promising than Superstars and Frontiers which were more uncertain
Knuckles who are you expecting to save you
i tab back in its fucking charmy
he talks more than a 4 year old on a road trip
I unironically like this game ngl
“death to all who pose me” shadow would hate gmod
I know but the audio cut out at the perfect time
I unironically love this game though
I love how campy this game is
me getting true ending has made me hate that level
30 min hero mission be like
I love how much shadow flip flops
I love this game so much
it’s bad and camp but I love it
I’m assuming you know you can turn off the yappers
"The BLACK creatures" game grumps joke
charmy just turns me off instead
I actually arrived last shadow playthrough on this stage lolz
It's like TP and Kakariko all over again
Idk what you mean...'06 trumps this one
I love how when you help eggman here you still fight him anyway
Like a slap to the face... oh nvm I see why
Why even have that as an option Eggman xD
That was funny given how small it was
You have to use the C stick, Phantom OpieOP
I think this game was charmy’s last appearance?
No I just didn’t think that would happen
I’ve never seen a level clear like that
Im glad Pocky can us since Sunday she didnt have free time
did you see what isaac said in racetime?
in the warm I did today I was hinted ook was small key so could skip that
weird hearing an older version of this song after listening to the ff14 version of the song today
see you on the other side good luck
imma guess BKeysy and lots of memery or BK in own dungeon tippiTap
all of us just have to be ye olde hush no thoughts of where
and obv. no cross strim info give as it goes
know what I hear? all yall quick feet peeps => wanna meme in the toilet paper rando
Wtf does that even mean jon?
gl to everyone involved in the race
@AnniLyn2 the reason I put "Toilet Paper rando" is cus "Twiglight Princess rando"
silly dumb word exchange on the first letters
I know about it... just didn't piece together fast enough
who else would make such a useful pape maptracker then?
monkaW why the crib on the ground
I knew you'd find that first!
Wait I thought it was bomb only xD
monkaSTEER territory, this is going too quick for my head KEKW
Pog free twitch turbo for a week
i sigh up and then hit don't renew KEKW
even tho my paypal have no money anyway
Phan ruined his dinner time evo17Wut
but the dodongo was dreaming of becoming the ne king dodongo
eating so many rocks that he could block some cavern off so gorons dont get the rocks they WANT to eat
Gotta grow a bunch... eating rocks help you grow big and strong
HOW did the shield not burn KEKW
this Twilight princess wood is weird maaan
clearly that was for demonstration purposes KEKW
Never knew that how was there
Master sword and big keys maybe?
Oh that's...I forgot about the light version
of course it was THAT chest
wow it’s been so long since I playing this game
I actually own GC, Wii, and Wii U lmao
oh yeah isn’t the hd version faster now?
glitchless might be a case made?
cus in glitchless you dont need as many light bugs
furthest I got with learning GC tbh was sword and shield
yeah I did it once and dropped the game after that lmao
yea so raw Any% for both (GC, then HD) => 2:48 v 2:56 rn
good old… what’s his name again? Jeremy?
glitchless same order => 5:25 to 4:59
I knew it was something like that
yea makes sense for glitchless given the QoL / speedups the HD version brings to the table
HD had cool bonus content with the amiibo tbh
that being said obviously grain of salt since I was lookin at SRC and that doesnt mean ppl havent uploaded for preview or something since the respective last validated times
the wallet is useless but neat
@pkmn03 kinda sad that its locked that way, hate DLC locked by a limited physical thingy
its like handing out keys to hotel rooms except at some point the room is permanently just gone
I’m lucky enough to own it LuvPeekL
yea the content itself I cant say good/bad to
just sad that its locked like that imo
also the fact you can get a 20 heart wolf link in BotW from it is neat
anyhow it does make sense given differences between glitches for the versions that you got different raw Any% routes / times
and given how currently close both seem to be (ik, even 5 minutes could be a huge timesave on speedruns) I honestly would never say never to anything
also the stamps are just useless with miiverse dead
cus who knows what gets found down the road
I mean like - OoT still has those very rare findings
*shrugs* I stay on never say never
also Wii U TAS is. weird
ppl have grinded weirder shit then that I feel like PrideLaugh
also Wii U tas is weird
I mean - low% stare at rupee'n hope you're at the right cycle for gettingmoved exists, no?
it’s difficult to play back on console from what I understand
and what I mean more then a specific glitch like what you're talking about is "who knows if ppl SOME TIME down the road find that one specific repeatable scenario where you can nail specific NPC behavior patterns to roll in your favor
and given how pape64 ACE started PrideLaugh
all I am tryin to say is I would not be surprise if thre'd be no one ever to find anything new
oh yeah isn’t iQue OoT unironically faster now?
we do not talk about ique NODDERS
I thought that was a typo
it has a 50% faster clock speed
like cpu clock speed or ingame clock speed?
also yea no surprise no one has it KEKW
I didnt even know it existed
yeah apparently they’re testing it out in the OoT community
basically games were illegal in China for ages so what they did is they made a new console in partnership with a Chinese company and marketed it as a toy to get around the ban
4k rupees or an angry man
also nice metal dink from the WOODEN shield
sounds like they might have at least go moded snowpeak yea
cus that place is a long haul
goron mines go mode would not have been vastly diff from getting BK given where it was I feel like
on the note of AG, you had BK in the big sandpit room right?
could it have been quicker if you had the health to just sand void respawn over save reset?
oh does sand pit void not respawn at door, but at last ground you were on?
yea its not a big one for sure
I was surprised you didnt do it on no keys yea PrideLaugh
p4ntzThink I thought it never to be that bad of a check KEKW
but I can see what you#re talkin about given that you never need it for Any%
that double swing chest is a HP chest
unless you can dupe HPs somewhere
anyhow: my vanilla brain casual timing for that chest is to swing ball&chain at the 2nd when the first you jump onto swings away
that way you swing both platforms towards each other
granted I also always look at that room from a "defeated ice knight thingy and poe" POV
cus I just dont want to even try with either being able to intercept
unrelated, but something which caught my eye rn given typing and playing a game with mkb: you know what the 3 basic LEDs mean on kb?
I know the middle one is capslock
got the 1st and 3rd going, 3rd normally never is and I am confused KEKW
as in the ones above numpad, basic keyboard
OHH nvm, was it Eldin bridge area?
Kak Underwater needs irons, so not quite
ya didnt have it going Eldin field
but before GM which you did after that whole thing
didnt have it before going stalfos grotto
the big one, not the smalls in stalfos grotto
ball&chain you got from dominion rod in pre ToT
cus single Dom rod -> blizzeta
which also led you to first fishrod, irons
and then at Eldin field you pretty much already just had go mode items to get before dungeon rush
Where did you find aruru memo?
Oh okay...I fell asleep so I miss everything xD
hey - hope the lil nap was good
as for your thought earlier phantom w "too much overworld, not enough dungeons" tippiTap
Missed my medicine though so taking it late
since I obviously couldnt go and say any thoughts to routing during the race
my personal love for that is "dungeon rush -> back to OW" coming from OoT / MM respectively
as in "when I can deal with a dungeon I need, thats the better density purely cus prog over not prog"
which in this seeds instance for me would not have been an issue since I like pickin up my tracks on OW after
like - what I reckon a pure "god route" thought even coulda been is hoping for 2nd clawshot in GM and on finding spinner just rushing that -> Snowpeak
meaning you then dont have the Eldin bridge portal or a good way checkswise back
--> not goin there for a WHILE cus you got closer warpable areas
==> long orphaning of that specific portion
ye, but aurus memo was MIA
like - when you went from GM to Lantern cave, my brain was literally goin in circles "dungeons > OW" PrideLaugh
cus "if memo woulda been Snowpeak => less warps around the map + an AG clear into clearing OW after
ohhh that one, bug check, not even chest
just tryin to take mental notes cus of while I am currently not playing randos too too often, I always enjoy rattlebrainin for "how would I play"
and while I dont have every trick ironed out, puzzlesolving brain and such
like - what I dont know is if you could pull better value out of the first LH checking with chickencannon and such if you only chicken once for the chest platform, then chicken back up and peek the bugs, then warp towards hyrule west end and such
given the 2 bug checks are equal to getting the 2 chicken flight/clawshot chests in that sense
but peeks are info on "if its something, I know I need to come back"
like - CSMC made me do real awkward routing in MMR just for specific chest peeks at times
"but LH clawshot flight checks + inside is more then 3"
like - making LH bridge fit in neat is rough I feel like
ye thats the issue I could see
and the only other way it could dare making sense is from pharon field
which as an opener is also a slow bunch
yea coro -> pharon field -> LH bridge is what I'm thinkin
then you could theoretically route into cannon chicken
problem is you'd have to cross the chu bridge overpass and shit
which arguably is still longer imo then warping hyrule / gorge from pharon field
bomb arrow clawshot chest + grotto you'd have to ride past yea
gonna guess horse is quicker then wolf if its that long a trip?
dismount is free as long as you hold R and target
cus you can just backflip off
if you still have an epona worthy distance yea
cus last I renember you cant dig as epona KEKW
honestly sounds like your discord just crashed
force boot it out of task manager, reload it
takes like 2s over on my end, not instant though
I think I'm gonna sit in a call later and stream Make a Good Mega Man Level 3
lemme peek if there's anything on their status website
does axl have everything for up there?
ohhh yea then no way fighting them makes sense
sounds like "ppl who did / did not go stalfos cave / lava lava lantern cave"
I'd assume some ppl have either not found Ball&chain or clawshots
and some are on their way to ganon
question I feel like is whether its the one from giovani or the one from up there which is MIA then
as much as giovani is relatively free to route in
Rando Randys back at another race
How has the sNeed been treating you so far?
PB and won by 1:10, can't complain for my first full seed in like a month lol
ty ty, Axl was telling me there's a pretty good field today for the TP race
Oh yeah 11 people, always more fun with that amount of people or more
That almost made me jump lmao
You mean you don't like talking in caps?
I like the house on fire
Every one of them is funny
Sick I have over 100k. I can send you a rando seed if I'd like
I'm gonna have to try that while doing drunk vanilla play
I don't use my laptop cause it's shit
Just run into the fire lolz
Little too close for me Link
So... the something good was a heat piece?
Idk if I asked this or just thought about asking...how come you guys never get twilight?
That's true...the zant fights make me want to scream
i had the dumbest idea ever
Feli you never have dumb ideas
i bought a mayflash n64 to switch adapter, and im going to use that + my gc raphnet to finally be able to use a gc controller on n64 nso
yeah the one works but for mm you still cant map c-right and the ess is all messed up
but with this it should be able to map all the c buttons
but idk how ess would be
It's 97 degrees + 80% humidity outside right now
And quite frankly I wanna die
You know there's people out there that say "living in louisiana is great!"
And I think those people are unhinged
Living in Louisiana is great is like saying living in Florida is great
Louisiana has won worst state to live in 2 years in a row now :)
This place is truly a cesspool
I wanna try so hard to witness Louisiana
Cause most the healthcare workers here are fucking ass LMAO
I've lived in Miami Fl for a good of 19-21 years... there's no doubt I can survive lolz
Oh there's no doubt you can survive. I've been here for 35 lol
Louisiana gives you the illusion that it's all about culture, but it's all fake.
Living in what people would call"hood" right next to opa locka and liberty city
Cajun food doesn't excuse the hate crimes
@Iceblue real but i know at least 1 person there who cools Gladge
im jealous of your vision here
The neighborhood I live in, which isn't necessarily bad
But everytime i hear a "pop" I get concerned
Cause there's been a lot of gun crimes in this area lmao
I'm pretty sure my city was in the top 5 US cities for murder rate when I was in high school.
Oh yeah shoot outs are fun...especially when you have school tomorrow and it kept you up
I'm 10 minutes away from New Orleans
Oh yeah, Alexandria is pretty ass too
New Orleans be like "we support pride and lgbtq community!"
Then people proceed to fire guns into crowds during pride
I thought you were holding it lolz
I still remember the one seed you did where both your go mode items were here
Imagine finishing Ganon off with ordon
You could use an arrow to pick the lock
High 2:10...anywhere above or below I'll send 100 bits
You still got top 3... did awesome
Was always wondering where to get the Mirror
Truly, it's snuck up on me
Gonna go check up on Axl...GG again Phan
What were the big time savers in this seed? Were some pretty big items in some out of the way places? Or just so many places to go to start?
It sounds like Axl doesn't know the hint doesn't include dungeons (assuming this dungeon is in the same province)
"Shadow you're so stupid" I would assume so since his friends have to tell him to try going down
thanks, got my first sub 3
phantom are you excited for sonic x shadow generations
I struggled finding master sword, so I went to do lakebed which dropped me in spring so did the DCS checks there and found it
was it in the spring? i dont remember
Make a Good Mega Man Level 3 has a Solitare minigame GOTY
It's shocking how quality the whole package is, some of my favorite games I've played this year are fangames
And the bad levels are at least fun to witness if anything
"Whatever you do, don't try anything funny! Like karate chopping my bald egg head open"
hold on 30 seconds i ll say it again
i like this game but it has its flaws speaking of have you heard of the reloaded mod?
for instance the mod makes it so you only have to kill 42 out of 45 black arms to do the hero mission and 33 out of 35 for dark
it does a bunch of other changes, too. Also I couldnt hear you until now because of ADS, so if you said anything I didnt hear it :(
Shut the fuck up charmy Madge
Sounding like one of the three stooges?
is this that sonic x shadow generations dlc
is there a link for tomorrows event?
go neutral route. work only for yourself
how fckn edgy were they to come up with that
going thru some stuff last night I found an unopened pokken controller
we're a based neutral chad rn
is this really the speedrun level route
When I say I like platformers on the playstation 2 they usually think of jak and daxter but the one I really mean is shadow the hedgehog
I am shadow android *bitch slaps Eggman to death *
guess what im about to do
thanks for all the help with pape related stuff over the past few days man! been insanely helpful
I just got here and my mind was blown instantly. dang rip cheato
No 4, no 5, free Watt, profit
Has that been pushed to emo?
for the randomizer what dose extreme shuffle do
@Axl_SR It cannot be .... yet :p
gl hf on the race phantom
yeah after you get into bathtub you can still go back right?
Oh it's a league race lol
and extreme shuffle will just randomize literally everything?
I am learning world record ultrakill strat
i dont know what blitz dose
there's specific set of chapters in logic, you only have to go to those chapters to beat the game
Remember when this whole sequence took 3 minutes or so?
Three of four spirits before the one hour mark, geez
BASED rando league based PAPE CHADS. We're gaming.
i wish i knew things about pape
I'm so papepilled right now im on my TTYD(switch) arc,
If you can LZS jump you can dominate the pape
Are you going to be doing a casual run of sonic x shadow generations live on TWITCH
Less than 5k away from 200k channel points
when you reach 200k can u buy me VIP
Phantom would never vip me for free he isn't based enough
You didn't get timed out lol
I got a warning with a Dog
PBounce in Star Haven then, yeah?
based yolo gaming on the chapter 1 scaled boss
I'm going to walk up to ice king and be like "I'm gonna wear you"
"You look like a comfy coat im going to wear you"
You should get that ruins key
Pink Toad Radio Trade has Power Bounce Kappa
This is likely going to PB isnt it
cant really avoid slow fight there with no DDown/PB
simply hit every 25% chance to not heal and PB anyways ez
see just avoid the heals and PB like i said
he didn't actually have it marked lol
that's probably the one he forgot
I just switched to my phone and I opened it to Anni xD
oh true I think I won in my group too then. I’m also 4-0
Can you see where power bounce was?
Power Bounce was in chapter 2 shop you could have simply gone in the pipe to get it Kappa
phanto274Sip that is not a sip xD
I'm not sure if your not is working lolz
Guess he stopped being a jerk after all
he actually just found last key and DNF'd
I check that bush first every time I enter Fields
cus I'm terrified of forgetting it
Pink I originally thought that was a form of OCD til you said why
You can update your PB on LiveSplit now!
If I had to guess, I'd say you are
You should totally just have this be a yt video
Just you talking to everyone and this in the background
Yeah but that's like clicking off as soon as you get to Ganon
You would be on here for hours and drinking water but no bathroom breaks lolz
The TTYD remix is boppin BTW
i started a paper mario randomizer i just got bombette and watt from Rip Cheato
Shut the fuck up Mario Madge
You don't already have everything at the 10-minute mark? Bad seed smh Kappa
Ok I got a 13s time on the level I'm content for now
I think I can get 12:xx on current patch I just need to move perfect but my hands are tired so I'm done for now lol
I have a plate of rice and steak rn and I’m so happy rn
I havnt had red meat all month so this is like extra delectable
yeah, choked WR pace to skill issues but we go again next week
First seed was a PB though so it balances out I guess
I missed it, what did crystal berry yield?
an extremely early Super Blooper you hate to see it
I like when the steaks are made :)
DNF 30 minutes in seems fine
No audio but hope everyone is great. Also enjoying my vacation so far!
they said thank you for the gl stavros!
Sweet Shroom looks pretty sellable to me
what'd you say about me? AuntSusan
well guess in you're situation, it really is all or nothing right now PrideLaugh
oh wow going for the giga risky play lol
Only 25% for LP to sleep
Wait, it is? What's stopping you from Chapter 7?
why are very specific songs randomized?
Oh wow, they deleted the mayor scene entirely just at the loading zone
Yo? 1 BP Def+, let's go

How do you know which one is real they all look the same?!
It's funny, there was a gap in spring where I wasn't getting any spam and now since a month ago, it's flared up again
*sees first message and link* yeah no no idk either must be a gift
Phantom, who did you piss off
i see like 10 bots a day now
ok that was worth the 1000
Sometimes they can be guided to a particular channel by someone instead of just causality
Funny that line when the one who redeemed it runs sonic
Hey so i redeemed a colliseum play. I dk how it all works though. did I miss you doing it?
Singman wondering why you didn't waste 10 minutes fighting super blooper vs him right now
I miss many things. So im sure I read it in the middle of teaching a class and literally smooth brained it
I dk how you do it man. My ADHD could not
Here we go again to reset hell then selttiFlop
in my defense glitchless and casual is the same shit
It logically almost has to be that though, right?
phanto274BLANKIES  Hii Phantom, good luck! phanto274GL
Forgot to mark at Boo shop
this seed after a 1:25 seed feels like punishment for something lol
you overtook him on hallway bowser
it was koopa kid that killed him
how did you win without star beam Kappa
You left 3 at the same time but Paul had already beaten Huff
Then, uh, Jr happened to Paul
he got to jr as you finished puff more or less
He also took more prep time going into 8
OH COME ON, ad right as i redeemed that
oh! it's just not showing up on my end. I see it on the stream though PrideLaugh
oh now I see it! refreshed
Me and raven did some SM64 shit at 3 AM
is setup for this pretty simple?
lol nope, all my stuff is physical
gotcha, well I already do gamecube randos so if I wanted to id prob go go that route
this rando stream doesn't feel right without the toad model
this rando stream doesn't butt butt without the toad model
back in my day, up was down and down was up
This goes so hard feel free to screenshot runera3What
Are you gonna be able to catch the direct live tomorrow?
What's up girl I mean they
I just noticed the smoking blunt pngtuber
Yeah, I should stop at some point
pepperoni, sausage, green and red peppers and onion
Go to a place that makes onions good
Omg I love wind waker! Are you new to the game?
The only "vegetable" that doesn't add substance is lettuce
And it's gonna get a rerelease tomorrow 100% guaranteed
I rather have onions than lettuce
released with a randomizer thank you nintendo!
The day nintendo adds a built in randomizer is the day the world ends
They're going to make the "swiftier sail"
Yeah nintendo with their wind waker randomizer official release
Wait I just realized the wott doesn't have a Goint!
Oh it appears as you speak
I mean I saw it but my mind auto filled it with it already smoking a Goint till I looked closer
the FFR marathon runners liked my TP run yesterday and asked me to pick one of the randos that didn't get accepted to do as a showcase this week
Also yesterday at work, people were shit talking the trapezoid in front of the owner lmao
Splash wasn't subscribed but gave bits before smh
Ah yes I love the sail sound
I don't think that's on mobile so uh... Too bad?
But also it's Splash and Pallos would want me to
this magic armor has no drip
I think purple is automatically drip
Does the miiverse bottle do anything in this
I think people should "Yeah!" if they get that bottle
It does make it look like PhG made it happen
I called FF not a "real" dungeon for rando because it only has 4 checks and people got mad LUL
yeah, the same people called the graveyard in TMC not a dungeon, so I just made the comparison for rando because graveyard technically has 5 item checks
like if either game had more large scale dungeons, FF or graveyard probably wouldn't count as dungeons in race settings
people keep saying how much they want entrance rando in pape
icebound said there are 1002 loading zones
entrance rando for OoTxMM can take people weeks when playing it as a full time job
same with ALTTP crosskeys, there are way fewer entrances than you'd think
omg, isaac posted a tp "race hints #1" video, and he starts by saying "this will be part of a series of short videos" at which point I paused and saw 2:44:13 as the length
@Phantom5800 top 10 epic fails in gaming
I personally played the ps2 version
spent like 2 hours on that one hero level where you have to kill all the artificial chaos
How is everyone doing I hope fantastic cuz you all deserve it
Just thought Id remind you that this is your last chance to add Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku to your nintendo direct bingo card for tomorrow. This one is a free prediction as preorders just went up this week so its guaranteed to be there. Cheer100
need to go the post office to pick up your next tub of rogue energy hydration
If everything goes to plan I will be dropping a sub next month
its our first 95 degree day and i want to damn near die lmao
yesterday I was walking my dog and sure it was hot but we had a strong breeze blowing. One of the perks on having the ocean on the east and west side.
wrangling kids in this heat is no joke tho
the girls full blown fought today lmao
nah normally they just talk shit to each other but there was fists and feet thrown
This is my first time seeing a speed run on this game
You were going for hero at the start?
nice actual US road signage textures
Shadow I am the perfect being I just can't aim besides that I am perfect
real life 25 mile per hour sign
oh it's for this chaos control thing
I bought persona 3 today, it dropped to 40... 70 was way too much for a remake
i guess just the base game
you can buy the pass but it not out yet
even worst you HAVE to buy the season pass that come with shit idc about just to play the dlc
Glyphic Canyon might be the most iconic level from this game do you think? either this place or the carnival one where Shadow says "Where's that DAMN fourth chaos emerald"
that weapon all i see is billy hatcher
Where's that DAMN fourth chaos emerald?
what if shadow said frick when you quit the game
okay so P3 DLC drops in September
@therealmaddness2000 Me petting my phantom mod status when I finally get it.
Do you want advice on that?
Well I think you are doing really good 👍👍
Do you want advice on that? It's a simple solution
Face right away from the rings when you start charging
The rings are to your left, face right, start charging, then turn left midcharge
Rip ads but not going anywhere cuz you are very cool
(You can turn while charging a spindash)
Anyway ads so I can't answer if you had a question
Yep, you gotta cancel to go far enough
There's a specific place to cancel in Westopolis right before a set of rings
Westopolis takes a long time to get a hang of, it's super tricky to enemy route
There's a lot of possible enemy routes for Westopolis
You might want to position a bit further to the right to have more time to jump
Are you aware of the SX mod?
It's a mod that doesn't change much, but makes the timer better for full game runs and a few other minor changes. Basically still vanilla, BUT most runners of the game use it these days because it's essentially become the emulator version
We don't have a full leaderboard yet for it but the plan is emulator runs will be allowed with the mod. Which would help if you wanted to make save states and such
bizhawk is such a bad example case there
But yeah, since SX, the community has brought down the Neutral Glitchless time by like 50 seconds
But it's not on the SRC board
I gotta head out. I hope I haven't been too backseaty or anything
If you ever have any questions, feel free to ask in the discord, everyone is super nice there
honestly fair - its definitely the worst of them in terms of how much resources it hogs though
yeaaa for GBA stuff you'd rather mGBA directly there if possible
how the fuck is bizhawk strugglin on your system
like - WHY is it strugglebussin - for ref, I am on a Ryzen 7 3700x, 16gigs of ram, gtx 1660 super
we're talking 5 years of use or 5 years since release? KEKW
and release about same range I reckon as use would be
so we should be WELL within the "why is this strugglin" territory
well - again, bizhawk is super stupid in terms of how much resources it likes to take up
hence why people were so fond about PJ way back when
but for reference: I had biz behaving on an AMD A8 6600k or whatever I had like YEARS ago
and with that we're talkin like "unknown no one even knos this chip exists" on respectively superbly shite board
and it was paired with a GT610
and worked without framedrops for normal stuff
so REALLY what I hear is more "it might be a case of biz doesnt like intel systems
yea I know what you mean, its more the type of framedrop where it just has a hiccup in the process
or like, if I were to apply MMR actorizer, "you look in a certain direction the game dips in frames cus lots is going on, you turn around its fine"
RA and PJ BOTH are better optimized torwards running
technically RA can use luas, just its sadly way more hidden then biz has it
its been a big why for me when it comes to anything AP related, since biz at this point to me feels like that old brother who everyone knows and relies on despite the fact its younger siblings exist
purely bc the older brother's been known for so long
AP I saw just 3 days ago that at least 1 APworld has RA listed
think it was tooie which I looked at
tooie does not use a patchfile yea
tooie is a lua hack idk about the other one
BUT I was lookin at ladx (so gimme a sec9
yea LADX lists RA as an option
it has either RA or biz
so Imma guess it has just an overall lua style hook
tooie does have it own client
like - in all honesty I would not be surprised, if other bizhawk lua hooks technically work with RA then
just that no one has put in the time to document it
cus for biz you see cases of OoT which lists bz 2.3x or higher v LADX listing 2.9x
and I personally just have been using biz for everything AP cus I had set it up once and didnt want to mess with setting all sorts of other things up
i haven't been on the MW for like 2 weeks KEKWait
input drops I dont know if you get any single emu which cant do that given input lag exists for all of them to an extent
like - none of them have 0 input lag if that makes sense
but I at times think I have an input dropped but dunno if its input lag or dropped input due to that PrideLaugh
thats what I'm tryin to say
as for mGBA: it does have scripting support by looks, just dont know which types of scripts it listens to? need to dig a bit
the lua scripts for practice I assume are related to certain scenarios playing out in that way for practice?
ye then I can see why you mentioned mGBA not workin for ya though
cus it does have lua access in principle
but by looks limited to network related
(aka you could try that for gba stuff over biz if its AP related)
I was just surprised when you said "it doesnt support lua" cus I had seen that and was like "huh"
like - I cant blame anyone for choosing the route they do - just is sucky that most things then route back to biz over anything else given biz has been known for LONG WHILES to be a bit of a cpu hoarder
and I think I heard more "bad" on that front on intel over amd cus of intels precision boost for 2 cores over all core "boosts"
meaning if the PID of biz hooks itself stupid or gets thrown about between cores -> hiccups
as much as it looks like those prices for around now are back to "understandable" - its still a LOT to invest cus CPU always goes with MoBo on intels side, and with AMD while you get a bit more socket support, if you switch you still have that combo MINIMUM
then possibly RAM as well as like the 3 key components if you were to think minimum
and thats already easily close to 4digit prices if you want something decent and possibly non-ASUS
(for me also non-MSI but thats personal wish)
like - right now I'd shy away from ASUS bc of their weird customer support during RMA being where it right now is at, give it a year sorta thing to see if they truly make good on where they screwed people over in RMAs
4Kids vas are so hit or miss in this game
ASUS started claiming "oh yea hear me out thats not the damaged bit" and then tries to upcharge you (including shipping) for scratches in cases of say their ROG ally (its now been brought up by GN with lots of loud, so who knows where its headed from here)
I know a lot of it is due to direction and not talent probably but still
but like - at the moment I would still shy away purely bc of not wishing that extra spice of shite w RMA on someone
“this shall be the last t- grab on to-“
(also yes, obviously grain of salt cus it was brought up on yt tech fronts, but like... the channels in question where I heard bad to me so far havent shown signs of being not honest in what they've shown
I know I am wall of text rambling overall, which during a strim as a whole already is hard to keep up with
not to mention focus on the run
don't worry Jonxhas, it's definitely appreciated that you want to talk PrideUwu
and also, THOSE RINGS ARE THICCCC
this legit does look like a fun run
100% take it over focusing on which mons I need to catch again for the AP I am in rn cus I am that far in BK (and so are most others) that I resorted to breeding pokemon for checks 🤣
3D Sonic games are no joke when it comes to runs
like - based on the specs you mentioned earlier phantom, I would honestly give a 85% that 🐬 works just fine
out here trying to find a bike whats up
i was cleaning out my room yesterday and i found my copy of this game KEKW
i've had it since i was a kid randomly cuz a school friend hated it and didn't want it
sorry i had something caught in my throat there i dk what happened
feels funny that this is one of the few sonic games i've ever played
here for a good time not a long time haha
damn, where is the position on the damn fourth level rail?
this game has a randomizer!? HUH
the question is really what game DOESENT have a randomizer KEKW
I just find it funny that THIS sonic game has one KEKW
you DONT like SA2B rando with chao garden? KEKW
where EVERY SINGLE STAT UP can turn into a check? KEKW
ive play the DK64 one which i like but man going from pape rando to that was a HUGE jump KEKW
mostly was meming cus I know someone who when they enter SA2B they enter that KEKW
and the first couple hours its just them flushing their seed out of chao garden cus its so silly easy
the levels in SA2B are in the same order
your emblems turn into locks for unlocking certain things
pair that with the per character upgrades
like - if I understood the person I know of right, some emblems unlock the level they originate from kinda like episodic unlocks in SMS
Stupid mario party...making me miss things
like - if its done like say how SM64 (not the best example) does it: options for shuffling moves, every star / box 1Up becomes a check, cap unlocks are shuffled about
granted, SM64 it doesnt matter too too much given you can skip most cap related things
could be interesting if one likes that
but if you dont have checks to it, logic side is rough then
funny note on that side: SA2B has traps for all sorts of things tippiGiggle
I thought that progressed further cus I misheard KEKW
why do you skip this games TRULY amazing story? :)
whats the most common ending for a speedrun? im guessing nuetral?
charmy bee my fav partner :)
imagine a leaderboard having every ending based on route taken documented KEKW
that would be HELL AND A HALF
eggman is cooked in this game omg KEKW
oh boy we love RNG in speedruns KEKW
is rigby streaming? I knowlike his card died or something
Are my messages showing up now?
I rebooted my phone and that ended up working
Couldn’t send messages  even on my own chat
revisiting alpha sapphire the the 360 movement is so nice! I know X/Y didnt have that when walking
you should run the "un-dub" patch
oh wait thatts for sonic heroes, nevermind
do they have jpn disk only?
last night I was messing around with pokemon box, did you know it can emulate ruby and sapphire? Letting you play it without gameboy player
can also confirm itll emulate it from everdrive too
Thought it would be a cool way to play emerald rando as a one off but its only R/S
there has gotta be a way to unlock it. Id only be interest in it as a concept to play GBA games on wii that way.
I still can’t believe they went with calling the aliens that 💀
i did go on romhacking tho to removes the restrictions. Like noramally you cant use pokemon box with fire red until you do the sevii island side quest for example.
also guy that made the mod had a video explaining how he did it so that was a fun watch
I did, I jumped around the first half and it was all stuff I knew. Its very base line stuff like how to climb vines
i did think that some topics he spent too much time on but maybe thats just me
It reminds me of sonic adventure 1 glitches
No that would make sense... count it out
We have a nice squished octorok hanging out in the background...looking as beautiful as usual
No free time save for you then monadoGun
using chaos control like that with how fast the PS5 can load maps sega could do some cool stuff with that... then again this is sega, not insomniac
Will you play other mario games aside from pape?
That sounds like a missed opportunity tbh
would you consider running rayman origins/legends?
I loved origins enough to get all of the time trial achievments
then id have to install steam and I def dont wanna do that
Well if it isn't the Hog with the gun
I'm still confused on the impact to greater Sonic lore Charmy brings to the table. Are all bees that big? That's terrifying
wtf, gen 3 remakes hand you exp share before you leave petalburg woods
You shouldn't talk to shadow like that Phan
I feel like to truly be the ultimate lifeform you have to be a little modest about it
When have you ever seen someone superior to us...be modest genuinely?
Can we have that part of the soundboard?
Getting in touch with friend to do the Gor Ebizo yell
thanks for confirming that 2 and a half years later twitch. "You can now use Phantom5800 emotes in other channels."
I'm late but I'm prepared to be sucked in
You need to add violent wind for it to sound right
Won't work on the edge instead of the middle?
Oh okay...but not too far as well
"Shadow! Those are my captors! They're on our side!
black out? guess Shadow was party rockin
I'm gonna head to bed...you can do it Phan! Night guys evo17Hiyo
this game is just too good to be boring
I think the angle is in between the dots on the ground?
LOL this ace trainer gives you a float stone, then you reload the room and he is replaced with a hiker and says how he put on a bunch of weight LUL
also why does it give float stone before the first gym?
make sure you open it at least once first
oh so what's all the stuff on classic mode?
storage is one of them, what else?
If only that tornado could actually suck things in
I can't really think of anything else SD has to offer that HD can't do lol
oh soup glitch is still pretty good in this game
sounds like a battle network corner
it'd be nice if classic mode had soft reset
I had mentioned it to soup but I guess we don't get it
Soooooo I didn't realize that i accidentally set dungeon mode to standard
I thought i had it on race mode KEKW
oh yeah there's also savescumming ultra strong in this game
also hi I was in the raid
So I made a new seed and changed it, and it was really good :)
yeah but with storage I really don't know how strong it is
i still get confused between silcoon and cascoon
Alright it's mad late for me, good luck o7
a top secret disk is a game leak
oh I see, superswim there, get storage on that chest, then superswim from there?
I’m curious if there’s anyone who actually likes charmy
oh yeah item sliding + storage gives you lots and lots of options everywhere
having the 2 most broken glitches in the rando both at the same time?
Charmy can be pretty fun in the comics
when I was testing, I found that the number one awful dungeon was earth temple. I don't know how much storage helps it
but all of the dungeons are really fast except ET
I’ve thought about reading some of the comics but don’t know where to start
@Ghirahim_XC Archie or IDW? Because those are completely different continuities
IDW is also canon to the mainline series
item sliding significantly sped up wind temple from my testing
I never really thought about which one
it's because of literally the last two rooms lol
item sliding you skip the whole thing instantly
Yeah, you can start by reading the first few issues and there are specials that provide context to stuff that happens later in the comics
IDW issue #1 takes place after the end of Sonic Forces
I found my pokeball for playing lets go LUL
its awful tho, you click the stick for A press, button on top for B, and shake for options. And its really freakin small
Probably, project 06 fixes a lot of the technical stuff, but I've hardly played it
btw star beam was pushed, I over had to edit my override so it would show for me
im always hesitant to update in fear itll mess with my over rides
did you get your controller sorted out?
in 12 hours we will know everything from the direct phanto274D
who redeemed that file name Kappa
well, since you found watt those are tech sphere 1 *pushes up anime glasses*
she has to physically be there
imagine hitting that tree again and it gives another power plus LUL
well its not like you have to fight general guy
that music there is so fitting
that sound effect kills me every time
my grandpa’s deck has no pathetic cards Kaiba. but it does contain; Neo Space Connector
do you still have the link for this seed?
man this is going to be an easy seed
I want Adam to do it when he gets back from vacation KEKW
its nice to see one every now and then
what time is the rigby race?
oh right, TP race is tomorrow too
yeah, it would have to be a sub 2 race for you
i wish pape had more chekcs we could peak
what happened? this seed was so good!!
you can break it up for star pieces
tfw Sushi wont even squirt on your face
first time I tried it I did it without understanding how it works... and I never got it again
how many channel points do I have to spend for you to time out Captain?
and my hammer will be ready for a 1 sec time out Kappa
IM SORRY THAT I DONT LIKE CHARMY!!
Levias, pay attention to the badge BP costs
simply do lava piranha skip obviously
I have never done that clip with Laki
but i still go for it every time i don't have Parakarry
I cant imagine it cus it's literally never happened to me
That 2nd race yesterday was nuts. I still can't believe you pulled that one off
he got in his own head a bit too much at the end
its ok BT. i got you on the two
I can confirm, Mr. Yuji Naka is not alright.
1 scale love to see it
Wait, aren't these the same chapters as last night too
Nice Spike Shi.... GOOD LORD THAT D DOWN JUMP
id really like to see Ko... oh
i dont think i've ever seen last stand above 3 BP that's fucking wild
you haven't seen a 10 bp last stand before reaper
iamgine getting caught by the GUN soldier during the voice clip so you hear, "Mr Yuji Naka Freeze!!"
Look if you combine the streams today it's 6 hours
I woulda done seeds back to back but I was hungry
Did race type settings with storage and it felt really damn good
Got the slowest dungeon trio tho but 2:25 is good for how poorly I executed with that
good luck, im gonna get some rest
we don't miss those blocks around here
jk i miss that block constantly
hey, thanks for the sweets. here, take this. its healthy.
could she be past star stone stairs?
Phantom I hate to say it but I don' think this is gonna be PB
thanks fam. I know she can’t be in Merlar’s sanctuary cuz yeah
It's the last pure hero stage
more hype for prime 4 even tho i haven't touch my switch for like 2 years
New Mario and Luigi looks amazing visually
You know what level I hate?
think i am the most hype for the dragon quest 3 remake
and they all for ps5 also
that direct was pretty good today!
I've been playing this game on RA recently.
Maybe knuckles should have killed one more thing. XD
Is there any reason for knuckles to be there during this run?
Cause if he does give you trouble you could probably quickly press down on the d pad to switch to get rid of him.
That's why I was asking if he's needed for this speedrun.
On on hand, the run went poorly, on the other hand, the game over yeah sound effect is an absolute great choice.
Gotta head out now! Good luck!
Good ass direct we had today
paperLurk gl and good funs w the run(s) PrideLove
yo! I can finish my seed
just need to catch regis and im done
I was sent heat badge and magma metal so I can reach the sealed chamber
oh fuck! I need to find wailord and rrelicanth!! I forgot about that part LUL
sealed chamber will give me their dex locattions tho
I hope you either have someone able to wondertrade in the multi or saw them at least so you can dex search for'em KEKW
you talk to sealed chamber and it gives y ou the locations
@Axl_SR sounds not too bad except for when its after E4 rly
well if its after E4 ill just do the box legends
or ticket legends if possible yea
my goal is 8 legends, I already did mew, lugia, ho-oh, deoxys, and latias
i would say the most disappointing reveal was mario party uses joy cons
mario party speedrun discord is very mixed actually
not quite disagree on the "just do DLC" but also nintendo + dlc has not been a big running thing
looks like the cowboy world is in the new mario party that cool my fav world from 2
was their first game with DLC fire emblem awakening?
guess I am thinkin not in the sense of small dlc's but "big" dlcs if that makes sense
like - sure, there were dlc, but most of them were very small things, and less often the breath of the wild dlc size or up
zelda warriors DLC on wiiU was a wild ride
it was also confusing as fuck to figure out how what which why
I guess in my head xenoblade as much as it is exclusive to nintendo *shrugs*
I mean the xenoblade 2 DLC that got a stand alone physical release
the fact that we also got perfect dark and zero mission and I didnt even bat an eye shows that it isnt for me
so... outside of that marPar stuff you were talkin about, whats the games they talked abou?
a NEW Mario&Luigi or more remakes?
I am mildly surprised cus of TTYD being the more pape oriented rpg spice they have
I wonder who is making M&L
and wasnt Mario&Luigi Alphadream and they kinda... arent anymore?
yea so there's where my surprise factor sits rly
them pickin up Mario&Luigi after what they sadly pushed it through with paper jam after dream team was interesting
just cus of what the sticker splash stuff enforced onto things
imagine the wow factor if we never knew about prime 4
I think by this point prime 4 was too hot in the oven not to mention
oh, I havent even been on twitter lol
honestly moreso fingers crossed given I have heard how KH3 went early in and played it after (mostly a fine game, just was waaay too expecation filled before release cus ppl knew about it for what, over 10+ years that it would happen)
how long was prime 4 awaited?
so it has a similar wave of expectations to possibly fight against
lol just saw the clip of maximillian losing his shit over marvel vs capcom 2 LUL
echoes of wisdom is what you're talkin about with "new zelda" ?
just saw the wee bit they showed - it rly looks like "Oh hey GMod but Zelda but TotK in 2D but we lego our stuff now"
it kinda looks like the LTTP / ALBW overworld but not quite the same yea
so know we know what grezzo is working on
the Links awakening engine by looks, more leaning into the dungeon builder aspect of it yea
I dunno - it doesnt rly look like anything past "look we gave you clippy from microsoft"
aka a named assistant which can copy and paste things
bets it will have some dark world shenanigans
as for the hype -sounds lots fueled by "we finally have 'The Legend of Link' memery"
cus you know - most if not every zelda havin to do with Zelda in some way the main character is link, so now we can reverse the meme I guess
so does mean its apart of "the fallen hero timeline" Kappa
Hey dude i love this game
lots of people dont cuz the controls
you know what stinks to me personally (heavy tinfoil hat stutpid bogus thought)
if u ask me its a skill issue for them cuz this games a hidden gem
that new zelda in correlation with the recent GMod "oh we cant have any mod content which remotely looks like nintendo" from earlier this year
oh yea that direct was sum
saw like 2 games worth hyping over lol
the mario and luigi brothership and metroid 4 look good
they really tried to make the mvc games look hype when we have fightcade lol
i do like the hitbox training menu tho
oh the race is about to start
apparently the silver voice actor had a unreleased silver game on his resume but since 06 failed it wasnt made
my mother fell and hurt herself in the driveway today, so not streaming in case she needs anything
i wonder if sega will give us anything good cuz i would kill for a new sonic riders
yeah, she's up and walking around now. Doing much better.
i mean we got monkey ball back finally
they could bring back that sega chicken game with the eggs
that rock was a spring lol
i always liked how shadow slides when he runs as apposed to sonic
lmao wood sword is in links house
right ordon sword is in rusls house
Oh man knuckles really got a show lol wonder what ken penders thinks
I forgot continuing the run means we have to listen to charmy phanto274Smile
why did this soundrack remind me of the pepsi man theme lol
i think the rings just make u go fast when u hold for the run
heavy dog gonna need more fire power lol
how many endings are u doing
wish i was going phanto274Cry  those are so cool!
Ill trade for a fishy magnet or keychain LUL
i had all 5 year old boys in my group today and man i am TIRED
well at least with that in your hands DK oldies cant destory it KEKW
you gonna run pape rando on that?
making a mario party 4 mini game tier llist lol
well he can just use chaos spears so doesnt need a gun
you letting rigby gen this one, I want blue key seed
Mr. who is a tornado, got it
fitting roll by the redeem KEKW
Has Sonic team ever made a 3D Sonic game that wasn't jank af?
What'd you think of the new Zelda game?
dont you mean new link game
cus we play as Zelda this time tippiGiggle
15* no? when was link between worlds?
they just re used assets and put a new skin for this game lol
cus you can technically do the dungeons in any order if you wanted to
just that the order still does make sense
Did i arrive at the end?
I'm down with that. 3m for an hour off is a common practice of mine during startup and breaks
biz is a fiddly piece of somethin
everytime I boot it up I have to config > video > display method > OpenGL > Hard Reset
I haven't played pape since 1972. My chances are about 1 in 10
@Axl_SR tippiThink didnt have that issue before
I didnt have that problem until I updated it which was required due to AP
@Axl_SR for you its not saving that one like ever is the issue?
I see Rigby has gentlemens'd to shadow the hedgehog
The real test of rando knowledge
@Axl_SR hang on am curious now
I just know bizhawk is ass and month AP is the only time ill ever use it
Don't mean to scare you but I put on my paper mario shirt. I can't lose now
phanto274GL to the both of you
Be afraid if Feeling Fine shows u[
Then I counter you by naming my file phantom
will be surprise if ch5 wasn't req
The PB seed was Watt start w/ no 4 and no 5, could happen
Watt at least is required to beat 4
69 420 13 7 - best numbers and the 13 darknesses and 7 lights needed to get the X Blade
For some reason I immediately read "the peanut butter seed..."
you don't even need her KEKW
Boots and Sushie, maybe we need to do winding path or Rip the long way or something
clearly, we need to win the game phanto274Smile
SLOW THE HELL DOWN, We're still in Prologue
Pity PareRaces has been out of commission for a while, this'd have been so fun to call
Somewhat doubt you'd have Sushie if Odd Key is available but who knows
So nothing in lower sewers? Huh
Reserving judgment but first thought was that I fully expect it to be broken as a speedgame
ill rent it through gamefly probably
gamefly is ok but it takes forever for them to ship games
its kinda strange they are just dropping a new zelda game tbh lmao
like 3 months before they announce it
I just had a spoop experience while havin a snacc - bit into a piece of moldy bread (just goin moldy, barely had a visible spot on it) - glad my nose caught it
they probably arent sure if it will do well
oh is that new Zelda game dropping so soon?
didnt look at the release date, only at the bits of the trailer which were ingame footage
did the mario and luigi game has a release date btw lol
Screw that, WE"RE FINALLY GETTING METROID PRIME 4
prime 4 does seem cool, but i need to play 2 and 3 still so lol
prime 1 remake was cool though
is it bad dragon quest 3 remake was my most hype game from it
i kinda thought they would do the other 2 games too tbh
maybe they holding onto the other 2 for another trilogy game before they drop 4
idk if i want to play with tank controls
@Feli_Heli i think they showed an ad for all 3 of the edrik trilogy by 2025
but i want to play that too
@Feli_Heli RIP my reading skills my b
gtg but gl with the rest of the seed
heyo, im bakc. I finished my seed by waking the Regis. Also I got fly which took me mossdeep so I didnt need the team bases. As for you I sent you spin white, hub batch, fast guage*, and Cyber ACDC Pass.
the first 3 are nice to have tho
TPR was very close, 1st 2:10:34, 2nd 2:14:58, and 3rd 2:15:35
we LOVE when in a Blitz Rowf 3-chapter completion has go-mode item(s)
@Axl_SR that sounds soo good compared to my last emerald experience PrideLaugh
tldr, 12 seed multi where I had a WWR, Emerald, OoTR and KH2 in, WWR with shuffled salvage chart rewards - didnt start with fly cus I thought "surely" -> free fly locale was evergrande, my fly was behind some random salvage check , my ability to do magma/Aqua purely was required for the sake of me getting a tringle piece for WWR and (meaning both hideouts required) 1 sword for WWR behind me beating both to get to the submarine area KEKW
like - I am tempted to roll a seed for myself if I find a OoTR pack for poptracker purely cus I want to condense AP related trackers in one spot which got like all the randos I feel like I can comfortably deal with
just so I can see how fucked the logic can get KEKW
@Jonxhas yeah it went by so fast, wailord and relicanth was on route 103 and lilycove surfing
the last seed (mentioned a bit of the chain of events) of Emerald had full everything turned on - I was like 320 caught data deep w no ditto KEKW
and if I were to have had the need to go for regis, my only outs woulda been catching me a "correct" wailord for breeding or finding the purple blob
cus I at some point started breeding for checks, but given emerald with dex shuffle does not seem to account for breeding / evolving in logic, only proper caught... tippiGiggle
tryin to piece together which routes would be ded for peeking encounters would have been HEEEEELL
which makes me recall that I need to see if there's a new pack version for APMerald so that a) trick house may be on it, and b) I may get the chance to map encounters to routes
cus being able to do that would be gooolden
is it my imagination or has PBounce been conspicuously absent the last few races?
wind waker HD rando speedruns are INSANE in 2024
and then the video is you licking a lollipop
oh is this start with random item sliding item?
for ch8 he was using mega jump
I didn't know that was a thing until someone told me
storage and item sliding worlds are beginning to collide
it's interesting how HD runners have to learn storage and SD runners have to learn item sliding
and some people have to learn both...
yeah I am working on learning SD tricks right now
Mega jump made ch 8 not ass tho
2nd of the 16 coin checks
I had 3 keys on my first visit to ruins
Who are you and why are you on my twitch?
So I had kooper almost immediately
I figured out how to get my fight stick to work with plus r so Ima start grinding that
I almost beat ruins on my first visit
I considered shiver shop but seeing how good mega jump was, I figured it was fine
Yeah, I stopped after 10th cheato
if i don't win in mario kart next month it's bc i was too busy trying to blue myself
don't you need to be in front of the chest
if you hold a direction it'll move
so you can use the note to time it
I took the longest nap frfr
It's been good so far! Been mainly doing S6 tourney seeds too to warm up with it
Today I had a seed where bait bag was in FF which led to hammer so I had to double dip LUL
Shadow the Hedgehog now running on chinese drivers
doing AP I noticed something with emo tracker and was wonder if you had any idea to fix it
Oh wait I didn't see this, what does this mod do
the abandoned ship, due to it being low on the map, it doesnt show all the checks unless you pin it. would making 2 squares be a good solution?
is there a way to add a scroll wheel?
Wash down those nuggets with a refreshing bottle of rogue energy hydration 0 calorie hydration in multiple tasty flavors
the other option is to have a very vertical trac ker so they always show
another option to to just move the square to like the north east sea corrner
it did during AP for some reason
i think what ill do is shift a little to the left and then have another next to it. Seperating them by dive location giving 6 vs 8
i forgot to check today KEKW
fly took me to mossdeep, skipping team bases so I just went to wake and catch the regis for goal
i still need glove upgrade and boss keys
I gave you the very useful cyberr ACDC Kappa
you know that emerald map with all the hidden items listed? I just went thru it and its only missing 1 hidden item
its on route 113, the dirt mound to the left of the 3 trainers
so i wanna try doing hidden items soon
so if you turn on everything emerald has 1338 checks, if you remove dex and trainers its 504
item is 160 hidden is 107, berriees is 88, gifts including trick house and gym leaders is 71, key items is 17, then of course you have badges, hms, ect.
berries dont feel that bad to me
Hearing Charmy's voice makes me angry idk why
See you later Phan...I gotta do something
Yo Phantom, gl on the runs!
Had no idea this game's speedrun was so short
"you miss 100% of the shots you don't take" -Wayne Gretzky
@Amishman19 you also hit all shots you dont take
@555forfaiz "you also hit all shots you dont take" -555forfaiz
sorry for late response; got a phone call- the seed sucked but not because of the new changes, because of my own incompitencew
Hai. Not staying awake, too high and depressed, but, I rolled over and woke long enough to think of you, and I just really wanted to check in. That's the whole, unabridged story. So, hai. It's lovely to see you, as always. I hope that you're getting by well enough. - Love, Viki <3
so tonight ill go over the tracker and make sure it has all the hidden items. I do know I have to add the ones in artisan cave.
im just too tired to play games lol
why does the level clear music go that hard
idr much of it, i’ll have to give it a listen
i was just thinking this character is adorable lmfao
wait is this not just getting to the end of the level or what
ohhh, i thought it was neutral endings for all missions
this game looks like it’d be fun for races tbh
i haven’t played sa2 but it did look fun
this is one of the few sonic games i’ve played lol
i never grew up on these games
only this, unleashed, and 2 but everyone’s played 2
idk if i still have my copy of unleashed tbh, i’d have to look
i played on wii at the time
i know there’s some differences between them
yeah something like that, it’s like ps2/wii and ps3/360 are the different versions
the contrast between doom and charmy is too good
the double peace sign from tails goes hard
Okay, I never played this game and after looking up the synopsis I'm confused the run stops at eggman and not the Doom
My dad was talking to my brother about that one Zelda rando he watched you do
you have to get like ten different endings before you can fight doom
oh man that's why there's so many categories then
Mashing X on rails is fun tbf
i definitely would prefer final bowser 20 minutes in tbh, pretty lit
there we go, all tracker updates done
i love that he just dies in like 5 different endings lmfao
is that the only thing it adds?
is expert unlocked from the beginning?
at least its A rank and not S rank Kappa
So I tried Netulla, I don’t know how to even eat it, it’s so sugary, way too rich tasting and gooey. The first two ingredients are sugar, and palm oil. I tried to put it on toast like the label says, big nope. I don’t know who would “start off their day”with it, or why it has such a cult following. I only bought the jar because everyone raves about it. Cheer100
There aren’t too many songs I considered great in this game
I havent been on twitter, hiding from boruto manga spoilers
So how long do we have to wait for rando on iQue NiceSoftlock
can you bring me to gdq? I’ll be your equipment b****
in ttyd I got to chapterr 4 and havent turned my switch back on since LUL
plus now I have perrsona 3 im not touching ttyd anytime soon
hows the controller from twitter feel?
I can't do it after having minimal
It just shortens it too much
I forget how long the seeds used to take, feels like PTSD I've blacked it out lol
what if rowf had all 4 fortress ekys LUL
then it would be a keysy seed kappa
And then you can't get into 1 cause you can't afford it lol
how you going to 1 with 15 coins?
by saying pretty please let me pass
oh no, dont bring kent up in suggestions LUL
SadgeBusiness only if the rando was open source you could just remove him
is this a 60 star piece seed?
but you need to show off how busted danger is
just use it on final LUL
parakarry looking strawberry cheesecake flavored this run
phantom skips the honey pot because even though it's hydration it contains sugar
bottom decking prism on snakeman phanto274Shrug
Where is ch0msky strim we need to nerd out over metroid prime 4
phantom are u a metroid primer
3 prisms and thinking about resetting
are you a metroid primer in this chatroom? give us sylux subs
if they dont release prime 2 and 3, prime 4 is gonna need an opening cutscene recap LUL
@Axl_SR you don't remember samus vomiting blue goo in prime 3?
he stole a metroid, thats it
did you laki clip the bridge?
tomorrow you should show that off even tho youll logically have kooper LUL
mario party speedrun discord made a jamboree channel cause generral was too active KEKW
from Nintendo's french site google translated...

game saved, ill give it chance time Kappa
what matters is I can ruin lives in Rainbow Castle
Superstars was primed for DLC and they just didn't
okay, it says the same thing on the english site too
I can confidently state that Rainbow Castle's gonna be even MORE toxic with items
I might still have a clip of me swapping places with someone who was right in front of the star
whomever chooses what the best of Mario Party is has prove to be untrustworthy
maybe if mario party sold like mario kart they would do that LUL
2 has like, 3 "decent" maps
it would be cool if they sold it to us as DLC AND included it in the new game
I say "decent" cuz FUCK Space Land
I dont know good maps, I only play MP4 Kappa
Woods is still somehow better than most of the maps from 1 & 2 they brought over
yeah, after the relay ill prob be done with it
also a LOT of 4's mini games are mashing
im mixed on 8, goomba is race to the end, shy guy is to the front of the train... it lacks depth for me
tbf, a good amount of 8 mini games could been made into regular control schemes
my group insisted on only playing the DK / classic map
the DK board is good tho
my fav was 2 and 7
2 recycles too much from 1 for my taste
I used to REALLY like 2
i had 2 and 3 as a kid for awhile that got 1 at some point
I remember having 1 and 3, but I don't remember if we owned 2
I recall renting it when it first released
I remember it being a party
so my friend asked me for some games recommendation today from ancient times he was calling me old KEKW
we did 50 turns cuz we were young, foolish and had infinitely more time on our hands
ok i am not that old
Thats one of the toughest games of all times
Recommend Animaniacs SNES and Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose
@buff00n you see i never played those
I rented them as they released on N64. The first one I was in 4th grade. Then in the gamecube era I had a friend that got every game he asked for lol
Hit your friend with yo noid
both were Konami games, long before Konami became the hive of scum and villainy we loathe today
Meant to ask Phantom. New zelda game. Thoughts? You stoked to play legend of link or what?
I'm gonna name Zelda "Link" when prompted for a name
haha i was not excited when i saw link fire off the last ditch arrow
@buff00n *inster buzz lightyears all on the shelf gif*
I just did a randomizer is this your first ?
Theyve never done it before do you have tips?
Can't read it on my phones small screen let me zoon in
yes, they have spend 1,059 hours, 42 minutes and 56 seconds on this single seed!!
I'm on like 8 I think
Do you often use the spoiller log? Or never
1059 hours on a single seed sounds like a no logic TP seed with lots of rupee sliding
ive done 254 and do care to do anymore LUL
Are you also a fan of TTYD of just 64?
That mushroom is kinda a stone
Its almost midnight and def still over 90 degrees here. I hope youve all managed to beat the heat
ttyd was my favorite the first time I played it... then I replayed it KEKW
Almost midnight too... was told it was hot earlier
I didnt even notice the plushy family growth on the drawer in the back
Okay I need to get rid of this constantly popping up so I'm just gonna put share
6 hours? That's longer than the show was even on HEYO
any% for world 4 is 2 and a half hour for world record
Just get the white yoshi and your good
hit the tree again, get another
digimon racing is 8 mins there you go Kappa
Phan how do I make the sub anniversary thing stop popping up?
I tried because I keep ignoring it but whenever I come to a stream it pops up
Yo digimon survive doesn't have a run free world record  POGGIES
Yeah there was that huuuuuuge controversy with survive right?
survive wouldve beeena great fit for Vita
Nah I was just making stuff up idk anything about that game
is there even a dub for it
The fact that Raphael's species has toes is so cursed
I thought you guys were discussing the show..
and am i too lazy to read unless it for trails
Man this lava section is BRIGHT
Luna you sound like the bot lolz
Wait do they have arms? I feel like I'm misremembering now
Says the weirdest things that nobody can understand
Raphael should not have toes tho
I know what you mean but..now I can't stop imagining actual birds with human toes xD
turbo is just speed up not a big deal since you can skip attack animations and all cutscenes
I slammed my arm into something and got a bruise all over my arm
just cant run fast on map
I'm p fair, so I bruise easily
I'm what people call a clumsy bitch
That's kinda what my grandma calls me...sorta
So I have a larger hitbox
Because I kinda wanna know how tall lolz
By any chance do you underestimate objects above you?
Because that'd be the worst part...fucking waking up like where did this come from??
What up! Paper mario on a wednesday, ooooh!
You're streaming tomorrow? On a Thursday?
damn that cutscene is skipped Sadge
idk the last time i gave him cake
no… got killed with rng like 4 turns
Paper mario doesn't start SIMPing until TTYD. He's a based chad in the original

dont forget to mark star beam LUL
dropping early GGs as I go to bed
well if you DNF everyone will still say GGs
yeah i am going to Bedge too phanto274GG
Aw man, I thought you'd be streaming E.T. for the Atari
Aw man, I butt you'd be buttming E.T. for the Atari
I will be working soon so I'll be getting ready to shower in a bit
I like how they say "YEAH!!!"
Yeah I should've said "no sword at start"
Bless your soul, I barely heard it but I thought you were stretching
I wanna strangle my coworker for making more chickens for me to harvest tonight
book said we only need 93 to last us until close, this was around 4
I gotta remove the meat and bones from the bird, and discard the remains
we use the meat for other products
so we don't waste entire birds
this mf'er made 54 chickens over, plus it's Friday so we are NOT selling most of these damn things
We had 4 ovens full, and most of the stuff in the case wasn't moving and this dude decided to prep 3 more ovens to "help" me
it's gonna take a LOT of my night
add on top that we've been harvesting too many chickens this entire week
I'm definitely going to Portillo's after this
around the time you went live and sent the @everyone I got a few notifications with that so my phone got blown up with the XI sfx for 4 or 5 bumps
break's over, I'm back to it
nomming on the mr beast box from zaxbys emerldNom
Yo Lurking destiny 2 with friends
chicken tenders, fries, cheese curdles, toast, a drink, and his feastables chocolate
ive always wanted to try the chocolate anyways
also i cant play the ap until tomorrow forgot about this today lol
thought of some silly emerrald settings
progression is only on trainers, so you can skip everything else
well, no grottos, no flight by fowl, and no hype cave anymore
i see you labled the memo
So I take it Poes are not shuffled
you do need ruppees. Spring Rush Time Kappa
no faron woods and no grotto, whats left for lantern LUL
I had to think hard about ZD, been a minute since ive done that check
if you have the rods the fish should just be on the land there
Haven't said that in a long while lolz
It's small but...mines, snowpeak, and city?
Was gonna say we believe in you but the keese said no
Anni, sent you a request on discord
I can def say Im glad im not playing this
This happened last time no? Convoluted signs?
And you spent that money lock?
the very reason I didnt enter
I knew no grottos would be a bad idea
Would a joke help you cheer up a tiny bit?
A guy throws a stick of butter and says butterfly
Phan needs a beer after the shit that was pulled
I'm so excited for Metroid Prime 4 after this week. There's like a 90% chance it's going on switch 2, but that's fine by me
I cant be excited with it so far away, glad we werre able to see it tho
@CaptainMD13 could also be dual platform
Will be dropping back to T1 for next month but will keep supporting as I can phanto274Smile
ill be excited when its 3 months off
Also, there is a nasty thunderstorm coming through my are. Also catJAM
did teir 2 get a price increase too?
Actually I like a good storm every once in a while
I think that goes into effect in July
We need it, we're on the back of that big Heat Dome
I was doing some weird Pape settings, may send you a modified version of them at some point
funnily that means it'll go back to being cheaper in canada (pre-tax)
Price increases are for US and I believe Australia and New Zealand
If I understand, Canada and UK at least had price increases a while ago
the tweet says "Starting July 11, we're updating sub and gift prices on web in over 30 countries, including Canada, Europe, New Zealand, and the US."
but yeah it's already $8 in canada
Oh, we pape-ing over here too? peepoArrive
What kind of settings are you doing today?
I ran, uh, Star Beam hunt with open Chapter 8 YEP
the original tweet said canada but they deleted it and removed canada in the new tweet
gooder luck on the pape i hope :)
Tbf the Metroid Prime 2 rando weekly usually only has like 3 or 4 peeps in it, and they are on SG regularly
Was TP rough? I joined during the transition to Pape
Today, I am convinced that people who leak video game announcements for attention are the dumbest people on the planet
You can turn off streamer mode if you want to see names
oooh never seen a pm rando before, looks like I joined at a good time!
i cant believe i actually caught the beginning of a rando
it has that uncanny vibe like I’ve heard it before, but probably not lol
well I own a Wii U, so there is half the battle won lol
I have played that game but didn't finish it
I don't play on switch enough
I was just going to ask if it had logic around glitches/ sequence breaks lol
Not sure I was able to follow the star way / star beam requirements, lol
I never found Kooper on my Star Beam hunt seed YEP
I assume we're rolling boss rush for BC?
Haven't tried super recently but it should
Is Prologue open or closed? Either way you should be able to get there now
I'm kinda satisfied with that, I'm already sick of fishing LMAOOO
I might do racing IL tho
Yeah I hope one day we find some glitch or something to lower the run
even if it is like a handful of rng manips or something
I considered using FeelingFine briefly today but it was too expensive
I ended up using Happy Heart though KEKW
I turn my controller 90 degrees when I mash lol
Wow something that isn't elden ring
I'll gamble if you want to be responsible for paying out
Lot of points on the believers, don't let us down :)
I got the big stacks but rarely gamble (usually bc I run and pay out when we do gambas)
yeah that was me, sorry I’m a noob LUL
I legitimately looked for paper Mario streams, and yours was the first one I saw that looked interesting
good timing I guess lol. I would have probably enjoyed tp as well
I don’t have a lot of time to watch streams but I’m home alone today since my wife’s out of town
I don’t have a lot of time to stream but I’m home alone today since my wife’s out of town YEP
Yeah lol just worked out that way
I am asking you to assist me with making some Phan-Bucks
yes take your time, no rush, the timer isn’t there
I normally do 0 but did 80K today
whomever wins, it's a pay OUT
I’m new so I need to start building my wealth
@MrPiffers add to the pot, that's how
I put all mine in @buff00n
This is the biggest GAMBA I've seen here
Because 2 mods dropped 100K on each side YEP
Nothing like a stomachache after getting home weee
Yes I went to Spencer's and bought only Sonic chopsticks
There WERE some cool Terrifier shirts
I had a moment there where I thought sonic drive in had some kind of Asian special for half a sec
for a second, I thought you were talking about the restaurant, not the hedgehog
well I’m glad I’m not alone LUL
I usually go for the Tesla coils and lava lamps
Going into Spencer's and noticing the mugs and chopsticks
Just to recap, goal is 3 Star Spirits, 30 Power Stars, and Star Beam, correct?
And how many total Power Stars?
Yeah so almost guaranteed a full seed clear, good to know
Whoever decided to give autistic people money....shouldn't have
you just triggered my google home with okay blooper lmao
FYE has a whole Miku section with cool stuff
I'm not like a DIEHARD Miku fan, but I fw it
never really got into the miku fandom, I’m kind of suprised at myself honestly
Oh, I have two Miku plushies
I finally have a keychain of a favorite character of mine
So when I saw him, I had to nab em
I also love anything Fuecoco related
I have a 3D Perler bead figure of a Minecraft bee
I have this legendarily awful Celestia from MLP figure
Her coat is white, but this figure is pink
Forget why it was like that
I finally went to Buc-ees back in January
I think I have that Snorlax plushie in the background
praise be all mighty buc, beaver of life, bringer of nugs
At least a smaller version of it
Does it have beads that help it stand up?
So maybe it just looks similar
Not like there's a shortage of Snorlax plushies
I mean, you've already been there anyway
How many stars are you collecting
Kinda weird how it took so long
I ran a seed with the opposite, open chapter 8
a lot of good stuff in here it seems
Ill look at the changelog if thats available
How many powerstars are you going for
Actually, now that I think of it, open ch8 probably makes vanilla ch8 a LOT more appealing
I might actually try that combo at some point...
Why did the koopa bros put that up there
hmmm I’m starting to question my gamba choices
@MrPiffers 90% of gambler quit before they win big money
@MrPiffers If this is your first stream, you'll also be back above what you started by the end of the run anyway
Laki also lets you beat 6
And 1 and even 4 if you cheat hard enough
so I got the 2DS back from nintendo and guess what?
apparently they dont have any so have to get one second hand
wow, that’s awful. I’ve had similar luck with them on repairs
...did it have one when you sent it in?
Bombette could also be in 5
should I grab blue moon, or sparkling water… decisions decisions
Only good song in this game
I think my wife ate my orange
I have lemons but that might be weird
blue moon is still really good despite the lack of orange. it was a good choice
it’s good stuff. I don’t drink much, but it seemed like a good vibe tonight
Can I go fuck myself for July?
do you do like a new game every month or something?
Allegedly the new Mario and Luigi has ILCA as devs
Can confirm I have the same issue, emo layouts kinda suck
does anyone know what studio is doing brothership?
I still don't get why ILCA and not intsys
Didn't they also do XD and colo or am I thinking of shit wrong?
oh so Ilca is the studio? never heard of it
In my defense the logos are kinda similar
There's also no way to rearrange things or remove the section that normally has the map
Oh, wait, no you can remove the map, it's just annoying to find
The "disable map" button just replaces it with black
Do you have it on map mode?
I remember my copy of the game would crash randomly in this area for some reason
It also doesn't seem to want to go beyond 2 columns, making it wider only changes the map size
It sucks and what makes it worse is that you can't even scroll
But I'm also just messing around in windowed mode
Partially because I have limited screen space when I stream
On mine, there's a scrollbar only when the window is narrow enough to put the map on top
I will laugh so hard if bombette is there
You have it to specific spirits apparently
Those weren't the ones you had
I might have mis-seen which those were
And the other 14 Power Stars?
Questioning good or bad so far?
After the kiss blubba gave you... he just wanted more xD
For some reason I keep hearing rip cheeto
Did you have Dojo/Radio on this seed too?
Dojo could be important if you haven't touched it yet
Did not know his name was rip cheato....
I never really played much of the first paper mario
I kinda just played for a while and then stopped
Yeah he was pink last time I think...or yellow
Figured that bowser fight was too easy
Your collecting quarters and playing as wario-
He does look like Wario a little
Beating 1 lets you into 8 at least
I wanna give names to all the recolored partners
I think Icebound said this is out of logic
Yeah I wasn't sure if it would block it or not but guess not
IIRC what Icebound said was all requirements for the Star Beam check + the Star Beam item are logically required for Jr onward
What Icebound said earlier was "mandatory ch8 battles expect all of "open star way" and "get star beam item"."
Bowser captured princess bleach no way-
So I think that actually means the star beam check since it wasn't behind the item logically in my seed
So yeah, this is out of logic but technically doable
Trying to figure what zouttputt is....
It's my name for recolored watt @annilyn2
For someone who thought it was gonna be 4 hours...nice time
Yeah, the only things that physically stop you from going to Bowser are Jump and Star Beam
IDK if you can Parakarry actually
But either way you need to be able to get up ledges
This game has some of the best credit scenes
Wish I was here during that poll xD
Ended up just being a 3-specific-spirit seed with extra steps
Wow that middle cloud is creepy xD
Yeah, Peach's Castle was in logic for me as soon as I could jump
You were coming in from right to left
Now figure it out again kazamsCatglubhappy
And I assume getting to bathtub is trivial from here?
Curious what jumpless vanilla ch8 would look like, and if there's already logic for that or not
As in how far you could get
Woops KEKW no streamer mode made me think you're offline
The Parakarry thing might be tight enough that it would be considered a trick
Probably tighter than the Boo's Mansion one even
it wasn't a 4 hour seed, huh
Settings were not what Phantom thought but we take the points and run
oh wait I need to do something b4 you end
Lmk if you want to see a demo of what emo looks like for me
i should be able to clear my ap either tonight or tomorrow
yeah sorry about that forgot it was the weekend destiny 2 with friends
i do have key sanity on so i do have to find my keys before i am in go mode
oh shit i am the only 1 that need to finish the ap
i was checking to see if i had last med just in case
feel like it been like 3 months
Welcome to the Mount Rugged Boots Emporium
...>Welcome to the Mount Rugged Literally Everything Emporium
Testing to see if I'm banned for letting phantom down
In my race with nsigman first set of rowf shop had both boots. It was Incredible
At least this can't be 7 scaled
If we were go mode out of TBC, then it would be an easy jet
I don't know if I'm in the position to always think like that but yesterday when I did open ch8 I definitely was
Because I needed to beat Jr. to locate my go mode item
So the early gameplan was to play the game normally until I could figure out how to beat Jr, which ended up being around level 4
Final was at level 6 for that seed too
I ran progressive and ended up beating a total of 2 chapters
But also fought every encounter I happened to run into in the early game because I needed XP
Enjoy your content. I get to watch more on YouTube, gotta drop the sub though.
1 BP P Up D Down though is nice
Why is it not sending the alert through hahs
And this chat is what we call, Improvising
The thought crossed my mind a couple times tonight too
no elden ring dlc my dude
thought u would be playing thousand year of backtracking
Wow, I switched to mobile cause a storm was amping up, and not 5 minutes after shutting my computer off, the power kicked.
Was that Thunder I heard or a motorcycle?
And that was unavoidable too cause CP had a fortress oey
And Mailbag was behind Key 4
if u had me here at start would have been sub 1:30
And by that I mean, just beat Jr
What kind of settings we cooking for seed 2?
poor mario he only just got on to credits then died
the more u impact the seed the more u will impact the seed
How crazy are the settings? Give us the rundown
no run    only walk    u might get hurt runnning
So effectively the only new ch8-related settings that matter is that you need Power Stars and Star Beam
Full rando surely nothing can go wrong :)
Yeah, I'm trying to do some experiments with open ch8 to see what might work, because I do think that has potential
do a no logic and see how far u get
awww thats what makes zelda ones fun
I quite enjoyed my open ch8 w/ boss rush and shuffled Star Beam but feel it could use tweaking
I started one with open ch8 but vanilla, didn't enjoy it that much and wasn't able to finish
But I think the problem was just that I opened EVERYTHING from the start, closed world with open vanilla ch8 will be my next experiment
Off the top of your head, do you recall how much the old shortened ch8 required? I haven't really played with non-boss rush very much
Okay, that's kinda what I thought but wasn't sure
Vanilla requires (w/o glitches at least) all partners except WeLoveGoombario and Watt and 5 keys which I think is interesting enough if there's only effectively 1 required dungeon
Yeah it did seem to be a pretty slow place to get checks unfortunately so you might not want to go there much until you could clear it
But it would require more items to beat as opposed to open boss rush ch8, which is just searching for the singular Star Beam (also potentially interesting but very weird)
I think I'll do a couple more seeds but then probably redeem 2 similar seeds with open ch8, one with boss rush and (if you'll allow) one with vanilla ch8
Cool, yeah I think open ch8 adds a lot more justification for vanilla but I can definitely still see why you'd normally ban it
And yeah, as for a full hammerless seed, assuming 7 Star Spirits, there are several glitches that would be required for it to be possible
Early Red Station, Raph skip, Ultra Hammer Skip, Flarakarry, and Kooper Puzzle Skip
I think the rest of the game could be theoretically glitchless
I don't think that's entirely true either
Last I checked, Bombette Puzzle Skip wasn't in rando, and there are some Stone Blocks in the Ruins and elsewhere I don't think you can get past
So several checks that do hard-require hammer even with glitches
Would probably still take some plando shenanigans though
Which might be possible in the AP build now that I think of it
Glitch logic isn't a thing but I think plando ignores logic
though yes, glitch logic is a rare sight given how deep one has to dive for that
ahhh didnt hear that my bad 😅 was in big lurk brain
I'm a little curious how many AP games have glitch logic in their base randos
Pokemon Red/Blue have like 2 glitch logic options and the option for each is whether to put it in logic or patch it out entirely
like - the big "yikes" w glitch logic for a solo rando let alone multiworld is how deep knowledge has to be
I know KH2 Rando has specifically CoR skip logic optionality
but not like throne room skip as a different example, since I mean - you dont really have MUCH going on in that game from a raw room traversal shenanigans perspective
I guess? you could say Hollow Knight has glitch logic capabilities
Yeah HK does have optional logic skips
Not all of which are glitches but Pape's aren't either
"where to draw that line" at the point of shade skip fireball skipping up platforms for silly bogus
or doing abyss shriek pogos for height w wings for similar reasons
like - I think the closest one could get to glitch logic being "fully written out" would be like... very old randos?
though then more then likely not available in a granular fashion so that you can disable more disgusting glitch quirks if you dont feel like doing very nuance specific shenanigans
like - I guess good thing that you have had quake / mega quake w peril strats?
out of all the things i heard why did i hear "i should be squirting"
like was toned OUT until i heard that
first you buy all these things, then you let them fall through your hands KEKW
excuse me, its not gambling, its rando 🙃
I mean, do we want to do a GAMBA ?
"chapter complete before next partner" sounds like one which COULD now function?
or like "whats the next dungeon gonna be" given you got dungeon ER on
the bot actually got a sentence out without hiccups
Gear would be more interesting with either Super Boots/Hammer
in MMR, someone I know when they did gambas for giggles did "which transform first" type stuff
Did you only semi-recently get the Odd Key? I could do a pred for if Rip has anything
so this seed is a regigigas?
but where's the other regis then
Can I get this in detail?
So Iceblue attempted to drown Parakarry
Probably the single biggest partner you could've found there
Those are cheap, free money in fact
Well if you need to sell them back, you'll make a profit YEP
Yo another good partner? The seed's opening up now!
Chapter 5 more like partner o'clock
yo someone shoved laki into a volcano
I don't think walking back was faster than HS lol
Random question: do you think you could have the automatic point redemption things also automatically mark themselves as complete? I saw there were 50 "queued" but most of them are Shadow from days ago
can never go down too early ;)
For now though, I can mark those Shadows and VIPs as complete, I assume if the auto didn't work they'd have been handled
One of them was auto tho, assumed both were
It's fine, you need to come back for Cake and half a dozen other things
Wild that regular boots Power Bounce is still better than Ultra Hammer
So 4 chapters left and 3 require a boots upgrade
Nothing interesting in the shop, nothing at all
Everytime I hear someone do a check in this game, I expect Brian to start talking, lol
A greeting I haven't used in years
Haven't said broham or broski since middle school
Inb4 boots in some random panel
Bow played a good game of hide and seek
Did you get all the panels and the Star in 4 yet?
Rough panel to have skipped, I guess
You can beat Ruins once you have boots
Random thing, I wonder, does beating Palace early delete ch7 Jr?
Still can't win without Boots though YEP
That is the cutest bee I've seen
What kind of sorcery was that with the gate??
I understood what you showed us yesterday trying not to jump but...that one made no sense
I mean, you'll be missing Boots stuff in either dungeon you could visit
Wait, this is just Super Boots (+ Power Stars) go mode, isn't it?
First 31 and now 10? Damn...prime helpful af
doing good, just got home from work glad i made it in time for the stream!! Hope you're having a good day
i'd buy the hell out of it
Well you gotta spend money to make money
What are we going back to 3 for?
Boots could be deep in Palace
It's the only chapter you can clear without them atm
I noticed there's howling right? Reminds me of zelda wolves
Super Boots on Rowf 5? Would be disgusting
I love the awkward pause anytime an enemy heals
I wonder if anyone's looked at the decomp to see why that happens
intentional. Let the feeling of dread sink into the player
"all that work you just did? I undid it KEKW"
Time for a chapter rush (but still looking for stars)
at least its not the last one that you missed a bunch, that would be the worst
Hey axl...how was the poke insanity?
you mean you're not adopting it?
ran progression ONLY on trainers. when I hit champion there werre only 22 trainers left including steven out of 484. Took 8 and half hours lol
It's unclear what items like Power Stars actually are in the Mario universe and whether they're actually alive (let alone sentient) or not
naturally I used the pop tracker for the trainers lol
Yeah watching you go through trainers was like evo17MindBlown
Nobody normally has the patience lolz
Sushie's not TOO out of place
remember when we had to watch the star stone cutscene, oof
pape.... pape...... pape..... there is paper mario......
All the letters here, which ones will result in stars?
had to just fill in the value
or maybe was a later boss, post Watt originally
Yeah probably the most checks here and you have to come here anyway
also I ran intoa bug today
Battling trainers it kept giving the same TM over and over. I was still getting the correct items but for a single trainer it was giving me 2 checks and it kept duplicating the same one over and over. At the end of it I had 7 reflect TMs.
route 114? east of meteor falls
I still don't get how you forgot you had revives man
That's always right there in our head when it comes to poke
off topic had a question that made me laugh, "Anyone got advice for making bizhawk not run like garbage?" KEKW
Aww you made tubba cry :(
nope, but its only been 90 minutes
Works well for me but apparently not for everyone phanto274Shrug
Did you race today? how was the seed?
I get errors everytime I open bizhawk I hate using it
I may just switch thee mgba for GBA AP stuff if I can figure it out
Has pretty good developer and TASing tools
It makes you do this again, huh
to be fair... that is a hard puzzle
Nothing but a letter to Koover YEP
Reminds me of something I wanna do
Ultra Boots do block like, 2? checks
my seed was sphere 16 but 8 of those sphere were single events like wake kyorge
Is it broken with these settings for some reason?
is it because Bombette wasn’t spawned in the room?
We've been gatekept by a radio
Is it possible you skipped the Bombette check? Does that matter?
I just got Adge did Koot not have it?
OOOOOOOH!!! THAT BOT TOLD YOU!!! KEKW
My memory was also vague but was correct
Kooper will be beating up the old coot later
So many fetch quests the back half of the seed
I'm sure the spoiler log would be something to behold
did you make any extra power stars?
As you can see, this seed is not dead.
And with that, I gtg to bed but gl with ch8
catch you later, im gonna get some sleep too
Thanks for saving us. Here's a letter.
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
live someone’s dream, even if it’s not yours
so whats changed this time phanto274Eyeroll
ill come back once they establish something, not a fan of different settings every week
i was looking for poes I didnt see it lol
you could start at 6 and tick down when you find them
And I got a mf award
well you could mess around on this one LUL
Oh no, I got another one
go warm up on bo and goats
And I can always pop by to grab food
is this trick for rando too?
i worked at burger king for 1 day and then quit lol
shoutouts to hardees for being the only place open at 3am
my previous job I only worked for 9 months, that was weird cause the one before that was for over a decade.
and first one was 6 years lol
Is it weird to be a lil sad about leaving?
last one was easy to leave, the schedule made streaming very hard
poeple shiny hunt pokemon witht eh gen 4 pokewalker!?
but isnt it optimal to do it at the beginning?
its gonna have sword      bow and  hookclaw
i am so bad at remembering FF > GB
@joshyy_xv no comparison TW clears TotK
thats a location for that, isnt it
i mean am I wrong? KEKW
how could one reasonably compare 2 fundamentally different core gamedesign decisions rly
I had to scroll up to see the thing you answered to axl PrideLaugh
like - open world RPG v Action RPG = 2 different design mentalities even depending on how you wanna look at things
@Jonxhas cause open world games arent fun, simple as that
@Axl_SR i agree i love this game and wish they released something new similar to it
@Axl_SR RARELY they can be to me - but a mostly sandbox approach needs waaay too much to feel unique and interesting imo
only exception is link between worlds
like - if I want anything crafting related truthfully, I go minecraft for that
i liked the mechanics in totk, like the abilities but i miss the linearity
the core gameplay loop utilizing it (to me) isnt
the fuse is stupid but the rest were cool
Such an odd color on link
id rather find a non hinted sword honestly
I say about 80% chance it's MS
You have the boomerang right? Grab the chicken
Well go get it first xD
without a bomb rock its locked at the eldin spring
kak only has 1 chicken, and its locked behind a boulder
To re-install windows do you need a second PC?
Bro was a tad slow in that run
I was sidetracked with discord, didnt realized Anni was here so... "ayo Anni! fifiBongo "
My existence is unnecessary in your eyes Axl xD
Now time to find the other lolz
I try to be a good student, want to learn tpr :3
my mother took my dog thru the drive thru at zaxby's and she was barking at the mr beast sign swaying in the wind phanto274Ohoho axlsrPat
That sounds adorable and hilarious lolz
I wanted to ask, are there any seed where you must beat twilight palace ? I never had to go there so far
I play blossom and drehen settings so far
Another trick to learn great NOTED
I started watching it yes, very helpful
This backflip from epona, I never understood how to do it xà
I didnt know about that for the longest time, then I did a google search. It wouldve been easieer if I just asked here... or just watched the input display LUL
zsr tutorials help also a lot but yeah, googling about such stuff is not always easy Coldge
is the tease in komari's discord what's next to come?
I thought that was July's game LMAO
has Spike been doing any more TP?
in PMR someone asked "where can i get the correct rom?" KEKW
what is clawshot is on graveyard Kappa
I hear the freaking small rupee amount noise and think someone messaged me lolz
You have that notification sound too??
my notification is a PET email lol
Twilight Princess, where Zelda tries to pull a Link but fails
Can't wait for Echoes of Wisdom to see how a Zelda really fights as the Hero
boss keys have no time to waste today
Are you actually gonna play the new zelda game when it comes out?
Im not excited about the direction its going in but I will play it. I jsut never cared enough about zelda to play at launch anymore.
like I got skyward sword at release for the gold wiimote, but didnt actually play it until year 1 of wiiU where there was nothing else to play lol
I thought the controls were fine but hated alot of the design
dowsing was awful, fighting the sealed one 4 times was dumb, wished fai would just let me play thee game, ect.
like who the hell thought I was a fun idea to look for keys in a DESERT
It seems whenever we play zelda in zelda games...they suck
cadence of hyrule, but thats not by nintendo
That's because Link is Courage which usually means blindly charging with a million tools in works for him
We don't speak of that game though
spirit tracks is a stretch... you draw a line and zelda follows. Thats not playing as zelda in my eyes
Zelda isn't and shouldn't fight like a Link
Her choice of weapons if having to fight like a Link is quite limited to usually bows and rapiers
But that's like saying that uh...one kirby game
The paint one...forgot the name hold on
But Echoes of Wisdom would at least do something for future Zelda in Smash
if you pull out the boomerang link will drop the bomb, I find that easier
Similarly Peach and Daisy will get something new for Smash as well thanks to Wonder and the new Peach game
you say that but the original cast very much has the same moveset for 20 years
Smash is about due for a reboot anyways
and I wont hold my breath
You guys make me wanna play melee now lolz
That better not be the something good xD
There's no way they'll have everyone from Ultimate return for the next one
One thing you can do is tap the bomb button, enter first person and aim, then tap the boomerang button
You sure it's not just hitting the ground by accident?

np, time to go google futa
I am too tired to look after copypastas
I know it says futa but I keep seeing fupa
we were just doing a bingo
i asked them very very nicely to stream yesterday and they did it
No, it is just based on position
Arie, did you write that pasta?
Can't be the MS...I thought it was in snowpeak
ngl, I actually dunno what futa is and I'm scared
if you google it you'll find out!
can't wait to chill this week
i also did ch6 card lzs on stream
"fuck me" well, there is a tentacle boss right there ohheyi30Hehe
I have a terrible brain PrideLaugh
good my msg  is ignored :P
i can't wait to lose runs to this guy some day
glad to know spin inputs also suck ass in this game
some things never change in 3d zelda YEPSPIN
With Zora armor on... somehow you died in the form of drowning
@Phantom5800 So good yet so niche ... it deserves much more than it's gonna get.
My setup is too involved and probably not even the best. I need to revisit
how old is the oil in AG?
That's why we exclude Bulblin Camp lol
I had to think long and hard about GD, thanks for spelling that one out
sword and boss key for go mode nice
when fishing there are any cardinal directions faster than others?
the redeems load so slow on my browser
I actually didnt see that LUL
learned th e other day you can break that with B&C
after watching Isaac's vod that doesnt look very hard
so we looking at a 2:40 pace?
That's why I don't skip it. Can just immediately lose
thinking about adding trainers to the next AP so I have more stuff to do. That also has me considering if I want to add them to emo tracker too
I think I have it in my video
Oh wait the horse section... yeah maybe 2:40
Not a zelda game if you don't miss the first arrow
Are you gonna do another after this one?
37/38 depending on link movements against you?
Did you like...get a sign that it was barren or something?
Idk 5 mins vs 30 lolz
It only saves 2ish since you are meant to skip bo and goats
oh nice! I learned how to add another map tab for emerald
I would only consider it in a 1v1
You did have a different seed where you skipped it and lantern was there
So I know I've asked you guys for tips regarding the tpr as a first timer... any tips for the shortcuts you guys use normally?
Like the time I asked about lja
I have a video going over a bunch of tips for new players
I was just about to do that... had to discord first lolz
Wouldn't that depend...where? The underwater hint
can you exclude Blizetta do you dont do it?
But still they're like throwing items so far
so for emo tracker, if I want to add checks to another tab, does that go into the locations json or do I make another locations json?
Wouldn't be surprised if MS was inside
It's actually good... got use to it lolz
Hey @axl_sr ... when next poke seed?
Wait but you gotta go to AG...?
Looks like it's worth it xD
Only one way to find out
well lakebed isnt required so not zora
Is that rock dungeon part of eldin?
on top of each other? yeah??
I told you... it's all being handed on a silver platter
Got better eyesight with that than I do lolz
this seed gonna be sub hour wtf
If you got the rod... maybe cat?
slowily making progress but enjoying myself
I got trainer sanity added to the settings
I dropped the extra tab and just gonna have it to the main map. Im gonna group trainers together. I found this on agatha and imagine this wwwill work in emrald too [ "clear_as_group": false, ]
thanks for pointing me in the right direction with thiis. Been enjoying it as I go
I tried tunic rando last night for the first time
especially when you have the base already there
We just saved the monkeys. We just saved the mooonkeys. We just saved the monkeys. To fight a giant plant!
Diababa said "nah this one is stale"
Probably looking at ook go side to side
True... so the fuck with you xD
Is the spinner check there part of eldin?
Thank you I give you a follow phantom
okay cool on the right track, I got the 4 trainers on route 102. 4 down... 480 more to go KEKW
Sadge had another busy day of destiny 2
do I want to account for logic or just get it on there tho?
i should have time to finish the ap soon
Did you find out if Ordon cat was dead?
It likes you when you are holding the fishing rod
I forget my path hints after I write them down lol
But I might have. I like crossing off areas
As long as you are still making progress though there is nothing to feel bad about
Desert of Showing off the moves
That was pretty smooth off lighting
You may have generated on the dev branch instead of my fork
It is a little different in rando I think because of fast iron boots
The poes are always cursing you out lolz
Did you know after team magma on mt chimney there are more trainers that show up there?
No wonder there's so many o.o
I was also playing TP, no rando tho
that's how they get ya lol
Yo i see someone like destiny 2
@blacktiger51 I may or may not play that game way too much lol
@AwwwShucksGaming same i have like 6k hours YEP
Stallord doesn't like it when you shit talk him xD
@blacktiger51 I also have a few thousand lol I'd have to add up my time on Xbox and PC since I swapped to steam from Xbox a few years back
@blacktiger51 I very much only enjoy the PvE side lol but I'm an triumph whore so I do PvP when it's related to a seal or a seasonal challenge lol
Did you already check cave by any chance?
okay why did you have to roll blind in my skull woods boss room Madge
@blacktiger51 have you run Salvation's Edge yet?
@AwwwShucksGaming yeah i have 10 clears
damn, I gotta add route 107 now fifiMadge
@blacktiger51 very nice, I've got 10 or 11 as well. Did you run contest mode?
@AwwwShucksGaming we went in beat 1st encounter then my friends quit said too hard
Just hakuna matata and find bugs that way
@blacktiger51 similarly lost 2 players at 2nd encounter, but got some replacement buddies and ended up getting to 4th but our brains were too fried lol
@Phantom5800 you ever do other Zelda randos?
ugh help didn't collect and i am finding they items still looking for my keys
Very cool, I've only ever done OoT rando, so I was wondering if you knew how the run lengths compared lol
yeaaa no logic is a different breed lol
Oh gotcha, that makes it faster for sure
I'm gonna be honest... your fishing makes me angry... sorry
I just pull as soon as I see movement and it usually works
The colors are actually a lie
are you able to memorize the path for the reekfish so you don't have to get it? or is it 100% required? only played this one once so idk
So the fishing... it doesn't need to go so far down... just a good tug and reflex pull
Cool boss (pun intended) but annoying dungeon
Yo I also claw shot through the floor in my house
oh no no one collected they items AAAA
How is the Dark Skyward Sword Run going?
Dee I just realized what you said... such an insult evo17Wut
ugh need a ice palace key
game knows you don't like it so it gives it to you lol
I wonder if I could make the hint in SPR hard-prioritize hinting the BK when it is in one of the crappy checks it hints right now
It prefers to, but it is not guaranteed
nope, or atleast not to me, its my thrid fav zelda game
The 3 hinted ones are the lobby, chapel, and 2nd floor NE
No judge on your opinion dee... just not good in my eyes lolz
If guys like being little spoon sometimes...I wonder how they cuddle lolz
I anticipate I will be playing nothing in the practice room
How do I not know that
Watch him be there the four days I'm working
play battle network in the practice room KEKW
I'm gonna be in and out of the event- I randomly have to go to work the middle of the week but then I'll be back for a couple days
Planning to call out of work a day or two to get more time there
I can't over the holiday but
I probably can over the weekend
i was just about to ask if you had the log still for ap then remember i can just hint for my key KEKW
I'll get in huge trouble if I call out fourth of july
Max was thinking about it, idk if he decided
One day JCog and I will get to hang out
Ya everyone was fuckin there AGDQ
I can't believe it moved to PA right after I moved out of PA
Did it not go well there?
Dude my dad's house in PA had mice and I really really really hate them
Oh hell yeah, I love that guy
I do not know that person
I'm excited to make some new friends tbh
Last time I didn't really like do anything super outside my comfort zone
yeah sometimes things just don't connect haha
Midna needs to spend some more time in the gym
Honestly the boss rush in this game is so good
but ganon is a huge monster
Uuhh... don't think it was your fault but the AG play
ok actually fuck link to the past just open a key door by mistake
so idk if i even want to beat it
Yeah but some of those tugs look as if they just swim by it
If I see it swim towards it...I normally just pull when it moves
Oh yeah that'd be so much better
or at least put the fish on the ground there
ugh the other keys are ass to get
Oh god then 6 or 7 here evo17Flip
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
really the destiny 2 meme KEKW
you can name the next one tiger
makes it harder to consider eldin field
how was the race? I came back to discord and saw 400 messages. a TL;DR would be nice LUL
but thats just one seed, you cant guage it from just one
Sorry I'm try to push up the flashy emote
I think it was city that kind of screwed you over with the BK
When do you leave for GDQ?
Are you gonna roll AP for the rest of us?
That'd be a new record for sure
i dont even know why we stopped using BK
I dont even know why we stopped doing BK
what do other zelda randos do?
oh since you are playing on wii, could you do auto tracking?
I might need to start learning some BK skips in Wind Waker guwuNoted
That hi agitha was the most "I hate you but i gotta be positive" ever heard
Already got memo...unless you guys mean the sketch
I always forget about memo also
I guess since you don't really use it
Did you ever check out poe souls? Curious to what it says
It's intentionally unhinted since you only need 5
The wolf thing can't be used to end the fight, and it can softlock so I would recommend saving
Link looks good with white hair
Barren Category hint can only be a starting hint in this distribution
You can jump and grab onto the side of the red platform, then climb up
A little more right I think
Then you can jump attack with sword
The hints aren't that smart yet, so that could have been it
when are the randos gonna be for real?
Yeah the stuff you learn for rando lol
casual or as the cool kids call it “solo racing”
FYI the ToT sign should hint about which bug gives the BK if things are working correctly
Ooccoo might greet you when you enter, idk
Did you check the FT sign? It might hint about clawshots being OW or dungeon
Actually it will since ToT is barren
It is 3 unless it was a really freak seed with items all over the place
Since we were unable to generate a Barren Owl Statues hint, there should be something behind at least one of them
The basic bow hint is a fallback
I found out recently if you do R+Y to transform while on the water floor with IB on, you should warp to the top
Can't be barren anymore since you found lantern
omg the buttons in the top right being different colors is throwing me off so hard lol
Did you know that Sketch was dead?
Oh okay. Those are just always the worst last loc
Did you do Faron Woods mist?
That should also be guaranteed to have something
Oh yeah we should start with that
Purple mist is just the 3 and the 2 in the cave
Previously we had the 2 LLC lantern checks to make gaming that a little more difficult
Love the fact that I keep hearing drugs and when you explained it...I spaced out lolz
Our dog does something like that sometimes
Normally she'd take her face and open the door more but lately she would just stand there and wait for it to be opened more
I knew it'd have arbiter lolz
No that one was specifically required
The text was blue and it said (required)
I might change the fallback hint (or get rid of it)
The alternative is you read the sign and only have 3 hints and have to know why
I could just make it a Sometimes hint tbh. That is probably smarter
You can't make that? The lock on was there
Hope you do not mind dear sir but I'm just gonna have this play in background again... but sleepy
Only 3 paths total including the ItemToItemPath hint, so only 2 to bosses
Yeah right now that is always a starting hint
Make sure you do not press A
If you look at the target as a circle, you want to cut it down the middle
They can both be part of the same chain if they are talking about different checks
Need to time if it is faster to do the 2nd half forward for Ooccoo
All you do is void, then line up the right edge of the screen with the right edge of the chandelier
Then use L to lock the camera angle
Right edge of the platform sticking out a little
I mean the part of the chandelier that sticks out right
Just touches the light part of the chandelier
If you hit that fence part, that is too much
See how the light part juts out
More than the railing on top
It is off screen right now. I would say you are too far left
You do a single B jump to the forward left
You transform once you get close to the pillar, but you hold L the whole time until you turn to human
Once you turn to human, you release L and hold up and mash A
Unfortunately it seems to be the most likely barren dungeon
Not even blocked by lantern with small keysy
Oh yeah just the first chest
Don't forget Spinner can break the spikes
Woke up before stallord again? Cool
I think you have it actually
Yeah it can be useful big keys
Decided to storm... no mcdonalds :/
That is the greatest way to describe the spinner here xD
It's because the first one was logically required
Bomb bag was hinted in Faron Field I think
Woah link actually went in this time
how are you enjoying these settings?
yeah i also just had a terrible time with the seed settings here
yeeeep, my seed was all OW or city, which idk which is worse\
but my req were GM, TOT, and City
well, id offer mine, but it has Gm (albiet barren)
if you dont mind city and TOT
barren TOT would be so fast and easy, boss rush
but yeah i did throw my seed into the channel if you wanna give it a shot, but im not a fan of these settigns and probably wont be running another one lmao
see, i will never hate GM, like we only need to find 1 of 3,and there are worse dungeons to backltrack through
What I am seeing is that people don't like open dungeons that much
Settings where you can see how fast you can clear HC lolz
i dont hate open dungeons, i prefer them, but i think i just had a bad seed bcuz im just not used to routing, its certainly smth i would need to have more attempts at, but im kinda burn tout from racing tbh
snowpeak is a banger duneon tho
Open lakebed would be even worse than CitS regarding IB
Hear me out, start with IB
for legal reasons that is a joke
I personally really like dipping CitS early, but I think I am the only one lol
It is super quick to enter
i just think becaus ei doint really know my checks in city good enough, its just a pain fior me to go looking through checks
my last 3-4 seeds have ben city wiothout ib
lmao i mean if it works it works
You barely use IB in CitS though
If you do fan skip, it is basically just miniboss and boss
East wing doesn't logically need IB for anything other than Aeralfos and the check after I think
getting into the room takes more effort then the miniboss itself lol
yeah i wish i coulda seen your race yesterday, but you didn't stream it lol
yeah i didn't join the race, but i had everyones races up on multistream watching what everyone was doing lol
then you gotta s&q tho to get out right?
Sharp Horse grass, thats a name
anyways im off to bed, gn, and glhf
I wonder how it would be if we started with all of the BK hints
I think the big problem is people do not want to dip dungeons they cannot full clear
I do feel like something could be done to help with scenarios where BKs are in dungeons though
Those are the ones that are the roughest
I mean BKs for dungeons with BKsanity
Right, just something good (which might be a big key)
The thing to avoid is having people enter LBT only to find out the key is in GM I think
Now imagine if Wolf Link was just any other type of doggo like a Husky
What if you start with WotH hints for all possible dungeons
Right we have not tried straight up telling people "go to these dungeons" lol
I feel like I need a bigger hammer lol
I looked like you broke the sword xD
Everyday is Friday if you make it one
oh! you meant the OP AF to phantom, WHOOPS
fuck dude, I really need to play this game again
I keep telling myself that and haven't gotten to it
ask and ye shall see the light
from all LoZ games I've played, still one of my top 3
YOU CAN HOLD THE FUCKING KITTIES
Same...I think because like... mm and tp are tired
LIKE WHAT OTHER GAME CAN YOU DO THAT AND CARRY THEM AROUND?
Rain looked it up...a pasta or chicken salad... with pickles
You got... one boss so far so...kind of good?
How do you like this rando?
Seems like a pretty comfy time either way
About what percentage is spent wolf vs Link in a typical seed?
Is wolf link faster to get around with?
So maybe the other way around
my friends LOVES asking me to raid close to midnight
oh i am not doing it fuck that
It would be fun to randomize what kind of dog Link turns into
Gonna watch stallord then head to actual bed instead of naps
Watching you fight stallord is funny
As I said Husky Link would be funny as hell given they're vocal drama queens
my 1 friend get home around 9pm pst and that midnight for me  and that a little late for me
Actually singing the song of his people
don't wanna do something that take 2 hours rn KEKW
Chihuahua Link would just be bloody murder Link
link just gets bitch slapped I love that scene
That would have worked with an A press
This game doesn't use the analog on the shoulders, does it?
Okay... see you at race Phan! Night everyone
evo17Hiyo GL and phanto274GG when it arrives
OK but if you used a digital button you wouldn't lose anything right
So you need to use a GC controller to play this rando?
I never liked how long the throw was on the GC triggers, hurts my hands
I only played through vanilla a couple years ago using the HD version, wish that one had a rando
SSHD is practically the same game as SS so if you're playing on an emulator I don't see much difference
Whereas WWHD seemed to make bigger upgrades compared to SSHD
I beat SS back in the day on emulator in HD and it already looked great then
I never minded the motion controls, only the swimming gave me a little trouble
Still, I'll give them credit for trying and mostly succeeding at doing something different
SS has maybe the best Zelda soundtrack as well
There's always that one item you gotta find near the end of a seed
So how many of the Zelda randos you tried?
so was running max settings to see if I needed to adjust anything and there is quite a bit. in 6 hours I did 676 checks out of 952. So ive got 276 left lol
LTTP is the only rando I've played a decent amount, what did you think?
Yeah it can be challenging at times
Just turn on boss rando, then Trinexx can be anywhere! :)
I do like the sheer variety of options in ALTTPR if you look at some of the alternative versions
Does this rando have any entrance shuffle yet?
I would treat those two as the same thing just as a game design consideration
Would probably need to put them in their own twilight entrance pool
how many seeds have you done today?
After this seed are you doing luigi's mansion 2 Kappa
what do you think of the LM2 remake
o/ raiding from a TP any% tournament restream
Your camera just decided to defocus
"some seeds just suck" yeah that's rando LUL
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Twitch didnt put first at the topleft
slowly taking powerr from the mods
Wait Axl what happened? What did you do?
Gonna catch up in a bit...brb
lmao at that map you posted
so I finished my emerald seed doing EVERYTHING except for trick house. Made a list of changes I needed and that is all finished now
if i can make it to another gdq, ima need your signature on my wii sandyxCool
i only get like 2 maybe 3 weeks per year off tho lol
this is how i turn my white wii into a black wii lol
i hate how the power light shines through the plastic tho
also every wii ive seen has the top cover broken off lol
shit ig I need an interrupt with those
i was thinking i was in pope stream for a min
I took this last one from math directly so
why is this a hype train emote
speaking of train I’m riding an overnight train tomorrow from VA to FL
Also ayyyy gl fam hello all
wait FL to VA I’m dumb
my issues with excluding bugs is II dont know bug checks, I just know checks KEKW
bet that really bugs you @axl_sr
peaked at the map without bugs, I really dont like that
like if im gonna go somewhere I want it to be worth my time
not gonna lie, I have 4 other racer streams open but only paying attention to yours LMAO
so if I want checks in a different tab on emotracker does that go in the locations json too?
sorry in advance but imma be like 5-6 seconds behind i think
was thinking it would be easier for sea currents cause the 3 routes have around 24 trainers
okay, this looks easier than I thought it would be
I dont know anything about lua, I dont even know how to open it lol
in the grotto...looked like a box next to the chest
weird...i'm gonna go back to my phone lolz
Cute with no armor but annoying
is it possible to get a hint like "morpheel is on the path fyrus"?
omg your A is red and your B is green... this is so cursed
now that i've seen the random button colors i just can't stop looking
did you find anything while in there?
uhhh 6 words max, what's blossom
"race with signs that have hints"
do you know if anything is in GM?
I want a device that can play PS4 and switch GimmeDat
I think that's the pc Axl
when you say french vanilla, does that mean right place wrong check?
do you know the strat where you hit the switch and ge tthe underwater chest before the door closes?
what is the dungeon before Hyrule castle?
ball and chain is so funny
are you supposed to revisit this in vanilla to get that
arie, you should see it in 100% KEKW
damn, what a crazy metaphor for corporate greed
truly ahead of its time, twilight princess was
but phantom, what if the 100 rupees possesses him again D:
i see what you mean about linear tho
"oh no i need the bow to go further"
does like, the three other available checks
Defeated dia and then hyrule castle?
I'm not alone hating the boomerang here
Link turns 270 rather than a simple 90...
Not yet or just at all?
Was there ever a hint for the bombs that you may have missed or forgot?
I just realized... counting yesterday. This was your 4th GM in a row
Why do I get a sudden deja vu
Still ended up 2nd so all good
No... green and dark red seems off
GGs on your 2:05, did you PB again
its wild how some checks can just evade you
did you get sword from snowpeak or find another one?
how we feelin about the changes
oh no, they doing extra checks looking for bombs
As a ootr player myself, I have this bad habit on tpr to look for bomb at any cost BLUBBERS
grottos r cool i'm glad they're seemingly staying
bombs and ball are gutted weithout grottos
grottos are not that bad when you play it, agree
oh zekann got 2 bomb bags
and boomerang is nice for other out-of-logic plays and general movement in certain places anyways
wtf what rando do u play
i mainly come from skyward sword and its fairly similar in terms of what you need
KG sky character and KV rock bomb heart piece
S7 is a little more open in terms of overworld
but you need bomb bag to get second bomb bag
they have most combat caves and i think a few extra trade quests
but they did remove ankle and great fairies, interestingly
yea cuz they finally can disable checks manually instead of in groups
yeah lol it only got developed like roughly a month ago
WW Rando is on WiiU now
lol I have a clip of your WW rando
^ both SS and WW got HD randos this month
Cemu- I mean legally distinct WiiU :)
Oh dang, also did you guys have some internet trouble yesterday?
Cox has been fucking garbage throughout my entire subathon
It was dead all day long yesterday
not yesterday but the day before I had serious OBS issues. It disconnected like 4 times. Need to remember to locally record mario party LUL
They won't put fiber lines here
what did the sign on agitha's house say she had, if u checked
IF IT'S NEWLY DEVELOPED WHY ARE THEY USING OLD NETWORKING LINES KEKW
"dom rod" is that what we're calling it these days?
do you know what the difference between "not required" and "bad" is in the rando's eyes
Oh good news Phantom! I've almost reached YouTube Partner! oranWiggle
do you choose the hat & tunic colors, or is it random?
I gotta get this year otherwise they're reverting back to the old requirements, which is cringe
cuz I hate the random combinations
or like things that only lock junk? that makes sense tbh
well actually idk rupees say not required
This game feels super linear so I'm surprised a rando is possible
@orangeisborange any game can be made more open with enough patches
not rlly but you got one that said ashei's sketch (bad)
and usually i get bads on bugs
whereas i get not required for bombs, bows and... weirdly, rupees? idk why they show a message at all, honestly
but like i had one yesterday that said "Wrestling With Bo is an orange rupee (not required)"
Bad means the check is not useful. Not required means not required (but it could be something like a sword)
yea maybe rupees are considered logical since rupee farming is so bad in this game
is there health logic in this game
you got orange rupee and piece of heart with both having not required
oh you know that makes sense
ok bad is for things that are completely and inarguably useless
It just either says required or "not required", so if it is not required then it is "not required". We are talking about the check and not the item
no right i just didn't understand why rupees and hearts were "not required" and not "bad" but i get it now
Right, that means trading Ashei's Sketch leads to something bad
ctmc is gonna be so sick when that happens if the devs plan to
I closed last night then had to be at work 10am
I bloody well deserve a nap
the main thing i want tho is the portal to the mirror being pre-activated so u dont need ag for pot
feels so weird having it be like completely unused even tho ppl dont really like it
unused in a racing setting at least
wait so where was rod in that equation
LOL?? i forgot u could break those with ball i cant lie
do you have any idea why that works
ok, was my thought too so probs
I’m assuming you don’t have bombs?
in vanilla do you have bombs in this boss fight
Ah I should've said what I was thinking lolz
how many small keys can u skip if u have boomerang
cuz like technically u dont actually need any for diababa
oh getting the monkey was for that chest. ok
i was wondering why u did that because i was thinking that would lock u into doing ook but if u dont need small keys that badly i guess it doesnt matter LOL
let's hope central north is also trash nindyStare
THIS IS SO FAST WITH BOMB ARROWS??? LOL????
I actually got to see that this time
what’s your favorite dungeon in this game?
so i did hit enter early thanks keyboard
true but i think it's funny
just trying to learn all the abbreviations so i know what ppl are talking about LOL
i do the same & i am reeeally struggling
skyward sword is so easy to do that for
but tp hints are so much more complex
and region abbreviations overlap a lot more so im gonna have to be smart
see, i did that yesterday and had to double check my hint LOL
so i changed it to kgy and kgr for now
tadpoli grotto pisses me off lowkey
clearly we should go back to forest temple for central north!
liberally? the woke left is infiltrating twilight princess NotLikeThis
let me guess she had pronouns too
is desert technically part of the lanayru province?
in the game i come from the entirety of lanayru is a desert ......
ya lol nayru is pretty massive
dude its been so long i would have no idea
srry shouldve asked are u ok with "dude" as a general term? i have a bad habit of using that word by default but i suppose it can have a gender-specific background so many as well make sure
yea it is to me too generally but may as well be safe
i was born west coast but i moved when i was 9 to texas ...
still fairly neutral here i just dont hear the world much in general
my car ac is kinda slow to cool so it's um. pretty bad right now
yea i can't imagine having no home ac in this heat
i still haven't gotten an ag or lbt seed
Like in sand in vanilla you walk like a slowpoke
this does look really annoying lol
First (? Mf is on bison milk) try
Unless taka added in the fast iron code
They did add a fuck ton of things though
Yeah taka usually keeps his own builds to himself somehow lol
Probably same as my practice rom then, very hidden
I have one that has equip swap trainers
And it's not in the main branch :)
Now to find which mf I need to suck to get emu in aaagatHmm
Well either that or run tphd but boko push looks painful
Otherwise it's a chill enough run
Nsq is weird because it got popular at some point where any% was practically dead
ok but that something good could be a sword
is there some really bad check this way or something like whats the hint for
Fight the boss that dislikes you for some reason
ok yea i just didnt see any paths other than the line straight to stallord
just me not being observant enough i suppose
what do the ooccoos actually do for you again
its been too long since i've played this game in vanilla
i assume that's useful to grab if u cant full clear a dungeon then that's super cool
these placements are so bad omfg
dude i was doing a seed the other day and i forgot argarok was only possible with ordon or above until i was about 7 cycles in
7 cycles of the second phase specifically
its only 3 with ordon sword right?
i must have misremembered then yikes
Well... you did say it's been long since you vanilla
ya but i've been playing rando recently bc i wanna play in season 1
and i've literally had city every single seed i have played
Hmm... maybe never just crossed your mind
none of my 6 have had lbt or grounds and only one had mines
Same dungeons all the time is one of the reasons I like 3 dungeons over 4
I mean, there are way more serious problems, but that is one of them
3 is so much better than 4 imo
for like every zelda rando i've played
Yeah go-mode with 2 left a lot of the time. No thanks
oh yea do u do backwards city because i saw it in isaac's video and i'm wondering how much of a timesave it is
Backwards city is only faster if you know the first chest is dead
I do it every time though since it is WAY easier
first chest as in the first one on west side?
yea i should probably learn it
So you know it is not chapel or 2F northeast also
Or it would have hinted that
lobby chandelier chest is so annoying
just thinking about dinner tomorrow y'feel
LMAO ball and chain at the beginning of this fight is hilarious
This one was still pretty neat
Hope you and everyone else going have fun evo17Banzai
You streaming tomorrow or is this last stream before leaving?
The banani heads into bed... night evo17Hiyo
you ready for bed bugs, rats, and glass doors at agdq?
hopefully you can go though, so we can build a house for 2 billion children with galvanized steel beams
i'm just gonna work the corner till i can afford AGDQ
I sent the bed bugs tweet to upper management
pittsburgh isn't too bad for me
but i'm not flying there lol
well maybe now it wont be with the bed bug situation YEP
they'd probably just find a new hotel in pittsburgh tbh
Both are mostsanity, glitch logic, open ch8, first is boss rush, second is vanilla ch8
its nice I actually have early game context now LUL
do you know the bottle glitch for walking on water?
but you can get an early heart piece LUL
but to be fair, giving up a fiary for a piece of heart hardly feels worth it
im not surprised, its the one I want too
how many ocarina warps are there?
this the routing that convient that its slower to use them more?
Hey Phantom, thanks a lot for saying hi to me at gdq. Hope you had a fun trip. gothic125Bink
It was awesome! Flight home was so long but made it back eventually
Yeah I had 1 layover on Montréal, then that flight was 5 hours to BC.
I caught the first hour and a half of TP, it was really good.
I have vods to catch up on
I enjoyed hear spike talk aobut it
finding that bombable wall took way longer than id like to admit
there was a bombable wall in a dungeon I couldnt find. I finally found it peaking at the map tracker
fortress of winds, the room had 2 chests inside. Im sure you know the one
Have you played the minish cap rando? Seems cool
its the room that has vanilla mole mitts
I need to actually beat the game first haha. I tried it once as a kid but I haven't picked it up in years.
Im in that boat right now in the middle of vanilla lol
I just have a hard time getting into 2d zelda. I like all the ones I've played but i just would rather play 3d
whats the butterfly? I see mole mitts is labled "mole mitts and butterfly"
been enjoying AP a little more since I swapped to mGBA
I can point you in the direction if you want it
youre in the AP discord right? Its the bottom pin in the emerald channel
out of all the runs ive seen you do in the moment I sturggled to get the book to fall LUL
didnt remember I needed the clone for it
one of your randos I was watching gave me a valuable hint. You can go down the well in hyrule town
Used that for water in a bottle to put out a fire place
"where can I get water? Right, I can go down the well" LUL
now that I have a blutooth dongle for my gamecube id love it if nintendo hmade an official blutooth gamecube controller
I wish nintendo would sell gamecube controllers again Sadge
Id be fine if its just the smash ones again
I do still have one sealed I havent opened tho
I got a brand new smash4 one from fb marketplace for like 30 dollars, the guy had no idea what he had. He bought it and didn't get the wii u adapter and just never used it
I did see for a 100 bucks you can swap out the ports for blutooth ones which is cool
yeah, it was never popular. It even released after the DS was already out
when you go in the head how do you know which pillar to attack?
phantom you missed the container now you might die
so I couldve done that and skipped buying the boomerang?
so if you get the magic boomerang do you get anything for buying the other one?
i thought you were going for it then saw you didnt have a bottle LUL
have fun making saves, gonna take a nap. Plus im on this dungeon and dont want too much given away
Does this run have eco-friendly wood vaneer
That'll save you in a fight I promise
Caught the GDQ zelda speedrun vidoc. Looked great
That is always a solid thing to have going after a big event like that.
Yo i come back to  a pape rando
What the hell is that following you
The partner is the true king
Why would you want to pay Kent?
You're actually wild for streaming the day after getting back lmao
My social battery is negative right now
But what if Chucky needs to do his laundry?
Store the cake and the what in the sheep?
Shit pichu is here i gotta go
Oh you're not going anywhere buddy
Btw nice comms to you both
i still need to watch the tp run haven't had time
HOLD up you in go mode? HUH
So with star beam being shuffled, do you still even need to clear chapter bosses?
Wait why did only that Koopa survive that?
Why am I getting children's boxing gloves ads
It's a lil popup ad underneath the stream
I do not have a child that needs to throw hands
I could find a child that wants to fight eventually
just a bunch of cheating as usual fodmonRIP
you've been gone for 1000 years
The ads just encouraging me to plan ahead
and now you're running in the sewer with a shit colored cloud
I wish I could live in a cold area
Heat is infinitely worse for me
Cold just means you can get cozier
Also fall/winter has the best holidays
4th of July only applies to one country
Pools are a pro of summer
Also more excuses for ice cream
Ice cream is an always treat
But it tastes even better in the heat
The sun just really doesn't like me
I get sunburned so fast if I don't dunk myself in sunscreen
And the sun gives me headaches
kanapeWave Best of luck on the randomizer
"I have never seen you around here before" literally just saw you five seconds ago
These branches act like those spinning gates at like amusement parks
Like the ones you push your body against to move
W E I G H T
Mario's ass must be so sore
It's either sore or he has the ass of gods
To be fair, he probably has the ass of gods anyways
hai hai phantom glgl with rando blobComfy
With all the shit he groundpounds
These doors look like chocolate bars
Do Boos even need to sleep
Unless Boos are a separate species
Cuz regular ghosts are in Luigi's Mansion
Like, can Boos be made naturally
i finally got a crt for free so i can play n64 games without input lag lmao
i wanted one for n64 animal crossing, because its impossible to catch fish with any sort of input delay lmfao
my everdrive isnt cool enough for animal crossing to work on it lmfao, it needs the clock things
do ace in oot to reprogram the game into animal crossing
time for me to check twitter
wait fuck you dont have adam for tts...
I have new shit me and math created but I can't use it here Sadge
im pretty sure the ique version of animal crossing is the only animal crossing game released in china besides new horizons lol

lol fifi has a coggers now fifiCoggers
He smokes too tough he dont need a beam weedMario
oh i thought you were done
I have missed the legendary cap
Did you hammer the crying yoshi? :( wow
That yobbi in particular deserved it
Wooah I didn't know you could first strike those
M4 was in peril and gameover'd to a bullet bill at KBF. The last save was right before retrigger prolouge phanto274Smile
I just woke up from like a 3 and a half hour nap lol
Omg I woke up from 2 in total
oh phantom, while at GDQ did you see the deku shield they gave away?
Did you get to play with the beatstar upgrade? The spinny one
Lai and I cleaned out the candy machine crane
We won like 40 pieces of candy
When i went to GDQ in 2020 they had F-Zero AX. That shit was so cool!!
Axl you should go to AGDQ
the AGDQ hotel was so far out of the way
sooo far away tho, Ive never left my timezone
were you able to finish all your TMC saves?
Wonder if they killed the few glitches lol
as if the speedrun wasnt dead enough already
Phan would you be able to send some of your old TP seeds? I'm having trouble understanding how to set it up properly
You're a goober too Feli...don't forget lolz
are TP seeds geenerated differently between playing on hardware and emu?
you cant even use the rel load method on console anymore sadly
it just gives you a green screen lmfao
yeah ive never done the rel loader way
Omg Axl that was probably the most stressful day o.o
the only benefit is that its faster to put on a sd card but lol
its actually more steps to do rel so lol
because you need to put it onto the memory card too
I do have a SD2SP2, but for rando I use a SD reader in the front
why did you have to beat ch5?
did you have exp not doing bosses?
i already redeem it and get hit with a Adge KEKW
Guess I missed my seed yesterday, will be watching the VOD for that when I have time
How did that seed go/how did you feel about that settings combo?
technically we were a few feet away several times i think
yeah, i was often hanging around with other zelda peoples
(I did pre-play both of those, will definitely watch later)
i actually was a little curious how easy the run for this is to pick up, and how the community is
i don't stream atm, so thats unlikely lol, on the chat bit
every GDQ i keep saying i wanna actually learn a run since its been years and this was one i was thinking of since i love the game
also despite a lot of my friends being 3D zelda runners, i like 2D games more usually
It's going ran some errands today
for submissions i'm limited to emu since i lack a capture card
ye, i actually was peeking at the SRC page rn lol
i have pizza on the way
omg as i was typing that i got a pizza Adge KEKW
i had some stuffed crust pizza hut pizza
@Feli_Heli that funny i had a Adge for pizza hut KEKW
Wait I just noticed that emote has a lil dingaling in it LUL
I'm getting a pep from a mom and pop shop close by
i'm modding chat in said marathon (read: asking chat absurd questions)
well when i modded for FF i asked chat what the bubbles in norfair taste like
oh neat, thats a decent amount of "i've decided walls aren't real" glitches. that ups my interest a bit
would you do a berry hunt if it was everr added to emerald?
you're in the right place then
as it is now it only gens around 22, not even close to all of them
24 if you do all of battle frontier LUL
Did you see that multiversus was so bad it made corporate riot shelf their plat fighter
Tell Riot to look at Rivals, or something
Bot can't use my emote ICANT runera3Swag
I misheard Phantom, I thought meant they were gonna destroy Limited Run Games
The gang pulling up to destroy LRG COCODRILO GATO GORILA LEON OSO OVEJA PERRO Pollo
My bank account can't handle that
If you mute the stream it can never say E
that a whole ass gaming pc
put on a hat and cast.. hat
no one cared who he was until put on the magic hat
Also while scrolling through the 7TV emotes I immediately noticed that the sprites on this Link emote are ripped from a Rivals of Aether mod > LinkSpining
You should rip meen sprites and put him on 7tv
@RavenFP I mean I can rip the dance
walking the pupper, right as I made it back to the front door I heard the ice cream truck LUL
feel bad for tingle, he always wanted to be reincarnated as a fairy, but hes always just gets reincarnated as tingle
does rando let you play as tingle?
can he at least follow you around?
you know playing as tingle is most likely possible if the devs want to do it
yep, got all my ww cheese, i just need to do ganons tower then im done lmao
yeah i played through goose game first, then collected the rest of my cheese as i went through goose game too fast lmao
looks like the old alttp layer glitch
ive never played minish cap, so i wouldn't be able to refute you if it was
hey, ya said no spam bots. never said anything about alchaholics~
if your liver divorces you who gets the kidneys?
the best game of all time
Not a cdi game but same developers as the Mario and Zelda ones
It's like a very early first person dungeon crawler about books and it has cdi type cutscenes
We get to enter gyorg socpensShy
yeah i like halls good mints
idk what either of those are
its always nice to see a technical play like this.
does he help you find articals and websites?
the story of high rule? is snoop dog involved? btw /s
vaati may have dark magic... but so does link it seems.
is ocarina a vegetable? wait i think im thinking of okra... or is it opera?
how do they do the kin stone heart piece in 100%
wait i mean the figurine one
And that was with like 3 minutes on the peahat and other rust shit
@RavenFP new trails game is good
so if that ties... coin flip?
is the ique like an actual n64 inside a controller, or is it like and emu thing

til bombs burn webs in this game
that almost sounds like a rando change
still so much to do monadoHands
It's just that I'm playing on tactician mode so like
I'm trying to decide if I feel like it's worth it to do the rest of the sidequests or if I just go end the game LUL
cuz I'd kinda rather play something else
I forget who it was but somebody said I should stream myself playing SMRPG for the first time
and that's kinda what I been thinking of doing
the only modern game i’ve played that made me want to do sidequests was nier
I'm gonna make dinner but I will be lurking acapriLurk
I'm honestly peanut butter and jelly on how you guys can make randos look so easy
I just complained to Axl about having trouble
Peanut butter and jelly? Like you know
It's because of the jelly part lolz figured adding peanut butter would be funny
XD that is a thing I shall do at some point
It would kinda be the same since I play tp a lot and you played pm a lot
I forgot a room in shy guys toybox which had my pulse stone and ruins had my only hammer :( for 3 and a half hours
For some reason I just never went right at pink station
Always wondered if going all the way around was faster than the fyers flight
You usually run on the other side. Trying the other?
You can use bomb arrows on the miniboss if you save your bombs
Been lurking, but remembered that I am out of food so about to go to the store
Don't worry, I am not buying real food lol
Literally had taco bell for lunch lol
The rest of this is logically behind Rang, but it could still be a sword I guess
stream was good, LM bad, but HKRR badtz first run completed
it actually has a slight difficulty increase and badtz moves faster
and cutscenes are removed at the end of a couple levels
i mean you just skip them anyways
but yeah its slightly faster on average
that deku here like 'FEED ME SEYMOUR"
i had to redo the train and didnt have special for red alert so those stages took much longer than normal for me
but with that time loss still a 45:12, so if i just dont die and make sure i have special on all bosses it should be as fast as if not faster than my reg any% pb
anyways i'm gonna run to wendy's and cry about that it isnt culvers phanto274Lurk
i had it 3 days that week
and i wouldve had it more if we hadnt gone out to eat
I stand on the corner of the grass and aim all the way up
Then move left and right only
was converting the metroid fusion tracker to an emerald berry tracker LUL
dont know if ill actually get to do anything with it but it sounded like a fun idea
possessed Zelda can sit on my face anyday 😳
because you're a god at this game now
Ganondorf, this is why you're terrible in smash
I never went got the liqueur
waddup! just was watching latest PM video and decided to see if I can catch a stream
i showed off my egg and crashed on gim cuz i forgor
yeah to back that up, i have to show off my deku mask to some random npc OMEGALUL
honestly, i got no idea that minish cap had glitches so this will be an educational stream for me
yo phantom, there was a report in PMR #trackers so I took a peak. Crystal King fight is missing "access_rules": ["palace_key"],
oh so I just need to grab the update from emo then? got it
like, to be honest, i wouldn'pass it by any game developer to make their game glitch free but then again, i dont watch too much Any% runs
damn no love for 8 huh
got to have tie breakers for those speedrunners KEKW
it's a good thing the minish elder showed us that secret doorway
without him, we would be soft locked
where's that one picture of morph kicking in the krusty krab
I almost wrote a whole word!
i'm still trying to wrap my head around the guard pass-by. Is the respawn point the closest "transition wall"?
oh boy. i got get a TAS run on my To Watch list to see how wacky RNG manipulation goes
"Holes are very important" - Phantom
where'd you get your ad widget from? I want one that's not just captured from the twitch dashboard lol
so you going to die somewhere and glitch with the fairy i asuume?
you still need to make sure you are out of bounds so you "land" at the right area, right?
Finally watched the VOD and yeah, you played a lot differently than I did lol
If you played in logic like I did, Super Boots was supposed to be go mode
having this 50 minutes in seems brutal
won't it be easier to do it on the bottom right bridge or d oy ou need to do it on the left?
You can do it! Be believe!
on the bright side, at least it's not a skip for let's say a 3 hour run
tell that to my head Madge
vertigo sucks, 0/10, do not recommend
i did early laki lzs yesterday to test something im selling and got it first try on my at home set up, it’s still the easiest trick in the game Kappa
yeah I didn’t know those huge tvs had less lag until aspen told me
like less lag than normal for a crt
only semi washed at pape confirmed
...what's the Q part of BBQ?
here I thought you were going to throw a sub cookout
has your next game for the month been revealed yet or did i miss it
so that means more shadow surely Kappa
oh that would be dank to see
is it a race or just a solo run?
gotta run to take kids to gym; glhf
How much does New route save?
OK not that much on the big side of things
i'm here to kill runs 👀
minish cap feels so cozy to watch phanto274BLANKIES
you can do some silly things with it in mm
I was never good at this dungeon
i hated this boss when i played casually lol
Vaati gets all the bombs sent to him
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
First of all, how dare you
Phantom, during mario party relay they had to copy a pog bowser LUL
Doing pretty good, been busy so i've missed streams phanto274Cry  but happy to make it today!!
Love how the chat on stream doesn't show the BWOWSER
And it doesn't break the chat like some do
how long was the last redeem?
wasnt the last redeem seed thing the emerald one?
oh i missed that one anyways
love btw how you aerolfos skipped for spike as the setup + time pressure combo was what it was during that tippiTap catsittingverycomfortablecute
somehow managed to click into that specific portion of that part of the GDQ and loved it to bits
tracking said my japanese copy of emerald would be here today but guess itll be tomorrow
Was worried I'd miss the start
you cant plan for stuff like that
as much as it was most likely a vetted seed to some extent
then again who knows, maybe the seed was vettet towards also giving tp tricks their spot to shine
FYI glitch logic for the seeds I sent excludes Clippy and NPC clips, if that influences how you play at all
congrats on getting TPR in, honestly I was surprised they took it due to it just being on the big stage.
For reference, Super Boots was logical go mode the last seed but you were slowed down bc you got it early with Ruins Clippy
was handled suuper cozy like - plus encouraging to see for ppl lookin at tp rando to see ppl happy to show and teach tippiTap
just gotta always keep in mind worst case seed gen with those hence why vetting seeds for showcases is just "will happen" imo
like - MMR as an example, god routes on seeds can be 1h40s to 1h50s in high skill ceilings for standard likes
but shit tiers can be 3hrs even cus goose chases
so to an extend, vetting just is normal imo with any rando for presenting so its not the biggest goose chase drag tippiTap
I finally got strength in AP so my seed is wide open now
I love that mario just can't do shit
make a prediction boots or hammer first
who needs boots when you can fly in style
can you get hammer first anyway
they dont have it, it doesnt count
i hope they are locked behind letters
I just put half my net worth into that prediction KEKW
And it didn't even make a dent KEKW
Let me know when you think you're stuck
Okay yeah you're on the right track
It is in fact in standard logic (but won't be once the rando gets updated)
Browsers gonna have boots and hammer
Killed it at GDQ btw. Came in clutch at TP
Don't worry, this check isn't important
Feel free to try but I'm letting you know you don't have to
Remember... rubbing your face against the wall to go fast only works in battle network KEKW
Is the RNG preset on the fight? Or can he do something else?
There is something you're missing in Star Haven but it's not the shop
Also congratulations to team Boots for winning the rigged prediction
Chapter 8 is already open :)
how many key items are needed for ch 8
Also as I was playing this seed, I realized ch8 doesn't require as many partners as I thought
Thought it required 6 but I think it only requires 4 if keys aren't vanilla
Will I get shiny rayquaza before this stream ends
love how you can buy coins from the shop
Why didnt you get that earlier
this is a setting I didn't know existed.
I mentioned being in Minneapolis for GDQ and apparently my grandmother thought I was talking about the RNC? fun conversation
Was watching without sound for a while. So open chapter 8, closed prologue and 7?
when random teleport every 5min or so
Imagine me, a rando player, knowing how to do ch8 glitches Clueless
WAIT the yoshis are random items now?
There are some ch8 tricks, including one to skip Bow, but none are enabled
a weed in the hand is worth two in the bush
Don't hide your weed in a bush Jr.  Rookie mistake
this somehow feels a wee bit plando'd with some of these occurences p4ntzThink
well - the feeling still is there PrideLaugh
he looks like xilebo with those p4ntz 🤣
I think I might have gotten a little of that the one time I tried playing on Wiichuk
I realized that 1 key by itself doesn't do much
Axl help with rando and told me we were almost at go mode... happy but also sad that I had to go
leaving goombario to dry out in the desert GoombarioLookingOutHisJailCell
were watt she my favorite partner in this game
You have to abandon my sweet baby boy in the desert?
The other day I was watching a seed where you used Gommbario for a clip in the volcano? Is that the only partner able to do that glitch? Or maybe I'm crazy
"Lyk dis if u cri everytim"
It was one of the hell seeds so I don't think you had super boots
Thanks, sometimes watching on YouTube makes having questions annoying
What do you think Chet Rippo's parents were like?
you ever just buy a coin for more than 1 coin?
Wild that most of the partners you have/have seen are the non-required ones
Which means you have yo go back for Goombario
Wow bots having a rant lol
is your bot chatting with us Kappa
you beaten zero bosses so far
Me too, that's why it's not in logic :)
i am currently playing dream team again
i was gonna be at an overnight camp this week but the location fucked us over so the camp was cancelled
so i was gonna play a 3ds game during downtime
but now i got a free week
i got a burning file for colo speedrunning soon *tm*
no i played fire red myself :)
i wanted to play that game anyway and use a dif team
so i sweeped the e4 with like wigglytuff and dodrio
oh yeah i saw joey also made gdq pax
he has a lot of items for chapter 7
You need a couple other things
And don't strictly need to beat chapters
Can you clear ch8 with just 4 keys?
Okay, show me the ways of cheating in ch8
In that case, do you even need any partners?
Question 2: Did you notice the gorilla?
Yeah if you skip the door like that (which is also easy), I had no clue
That's easy and I guess skips all partners and 1 key
I can tell you where some stuff was that doesn't matter now
5th key was in ch8 dark room
Had no idea it would be that simple to skip the biggest chunk of 8, that makes vanilla a bit less interesting in this context
Hmm that could be something eventually
And yeah, that door is a little weird
Yeah, probably the last vanilla ch8 seed I roll for a while, but I may roll some more Star Beam hunt seeds
I agree that the Star Beam hunt is more interesting
In theory, vanilla ch8 is sort of like 1 specific spirit no LCL
Was lurking during the other one, but i have been here
Early star pieces are always good.
I also would like to chill out
I laid down for a nap and now im back
Last I remember you got ruins key from boo shop
how does it lock star beam behind 7 chapters but not vanilla?
just find random cake in a bush, send it to prince mush
mario, can you go find my calculator? i really need it. *looks at his shelf*
its all good. i answer to both... but it was weird
naw i believe in you bud. just gotta go faster gdqSpin
if only you had a potato to fry in that frying pan
what is your least favorite music in this game?
man i struggle doing this area normally... here you are doing it backwards
I'm back. Did we save Goombario yet?
Star, stone, and bean are my top three genders
But I'm here for free BibleThump
YouTube pays me to be here
@bsmith906 oh, so youtubexon must be a friend from work
If I get a job by then, I'll be sure to throw you some cheddar
Yeah, I can't do AGDQ because it's in Philadelphia in the winter and I'm not trying to freeze to death in my van
been playing TTYD while lurking, I've got "Spin Envy"
@buff00n That condition is terminal you will die in 2 weeks
the lima bean is hidden well it seems
when are you planning on the sticker set
Thanks for letting me know, anni was asking
man bbq sounds good right now...
Holy shit I love the name BBQ
i was gonna say im sure its either in a vod or a video somewhere, promo timeeee
that 4th ruins key got me kinda excited tbh
watch bean be on shiver mountain
so she only drops the 5 items after snowmen are done?
i could never figure out how to get her to do that...
it was the switch in toybox
well now nothing matters and that was blessedly quick
or just be in go mode 4Head
surely one of the fights wont be 4 dudes
ominous music for the victory lol
can't believe the smores ramen was peak
I got my japanese emerald copy and put eveerrything on pokemon box. It translates all the movesets, stats, hold items, and natures. It also tells me friendship levels like excellent or so-so telling me which mons they mained. pretty cool stuff.
well on swiss I do KEKW
Just like how I own the colosseum bonus disc and DEFINITELY paid $300+ dollar for Jirachi
I spent the whole day learning how to do shiny jirachi manipulation
the gen 3 distro roms have that jirachi too, you just need an everdrive and link it with a regular cart
those roms also have all the pokemon box eggs. So I got the surf pichu egg for free. PB expects you to fill it with 1500 mons to get it
Gl, even though you're probably going to be first :P
So when are we getting the seed
I thought about joining, then we got thunder and dog was cowering again
I got gifted?!?! Thanks man! You didn't need to do that
Gotta go do dishes..hope to be back before this starts
so all keys are in own dungeon?
since noon and 6 tied, I said "guess we start at 3" LUL
I will kick you off anyways
eager to see it land on BN3
did you ever finish those notes?
looks like Pocky fixed her controller
you could delay until the song ends
best of luck on the race
Imagine if at GDQ spike had vanilla LUL
when I started the seed with Anni I wasnt sure if shops were on. Entered Sera's shop and saw boomerang LUL
what if Link was BETRAYED by his FRIENDS and TRAPPED as a wolf for half of this game?
anything from rock bomb chest and beyond?
i look away for 2 secs what did i  miss?
its like palace key, nice to see early
I mow my yard with a ball and chain too
so a seed can break a vine....but not a metal ball and chain with spikes...makes sense
so i saw that I could get a 3DS capture installed for $160 on the old 3DS XL I dont have a ton of interest at the moment in streaming DS/3DS but its only gonna get more expensive down the road...
its from an ebay listing, not sure how sketch those are
do you know the enemy can knock you up there?
I got the bot to say Phan?? Axl you sure that wasn't already there?
Can't be real...I dont think I did it lolz
I got the bot to say alot of battle network lingo
Living Up To the Name "Isle of Riches"
that sure saves alot of time
I keep forgetting you can hold it
Right side city is not behind IB
My god that Pikachu is adorable af
Only the miniboss and check behind it
@AnniLyn2 monado has a ton of cute pichu emotes
with all the pichu emotes I was surprised he doesnt run pokemon LUL
have cute emotes i mean haha
phantom i'm never gonna be able to sub for more than 11 months because i want to keep this badge forever
Yeh they are cute af phanto274Mash
no boomerang yet is kinda stinky
can fairy tears speed up argorok?
Will you have to restart the seed we're doing or do I have to make a new one now that you peeked?
Gotta keep note of that area o.o
id be in favor of making a new one, and I pinky swear not to look if we dont finish it or else fifiFade
yeah but there's a big void underneath
can I make a prediction of what I think will happen?
I think memo will be in lakebed
What if one sword was in lakebed evo17Wut
not an option, bad game Boo
I was ready to scream too
does this rando lend itself well for bingo?
That'd be a fun drinking bingo
We do Holiday co-op bingo every winter
to make everything snowy and santa, etc.
its not a phantom stream until we shit on bizhawk KEKW
the very reason i switched to mgba
I remember it freezing up on me in PMR races and wondering when the last time I saved was lol
Moving on vines on ceilings is the most random mechanic in this game
I log into bsky and first thing I see is "Pikmin could be an amazing roguelite" lol
i actually did a full game run today in mm lmfao
It started off good but then boom...erang
You have the iron boots now so maybe by eldin the memo?
what the trick with wolf there?
i forgot what time the race started... sad
would you feel different if you do lake hylia early?
oof thats bad rng for boomer
Since you already did it, if you ever get an Aeralfos hint you know that east wing is not dead
get everything in the game and be sword away from go mode... gets wooden sword
That set a bunch in motion huh?
I missed all of desert, howd it go?
Friday Wierd Al is dropping a new single to mark 10 years since his last album
Got just about every single item on that wheel
Or maybe you do have them all
that look you gave the game KEKW
Since you asked earlier, if we make a path hint toward the item then it is logically required
"I don't know how to do it" *proceeds to do it anyways* GIGACHAD
the handle on the lantern is an ordon goat with its horns wrapping around
random question for the group, any of y'all eaten at Nandos Peri Peri chicken?
i hear that nandos is good but ive personally never tried it
I'm applying for a job there, and was curious
I’ve heard it’s good, but don’t know how the Canada version compares since US fast food and chains are usually better
I've never had it, and I'm on the opposite side of the country of any nandos right now..
I have Zaxby's in my rotation
honestly... i don't think any of the chicken fast food places are good
people rave about raising canes and i think it's very mid
food service food honestly doesn't have the budget to be good anymore, my bar right now is "not dogshit"
@Serendipity29 but where else can I get my Mr Beast Box KEKW
it's the only fast food thing i really buy aside from like when i travel
not if you use the app!
Mcdonalds has a 5 dollar meal deal right now that's actually kinda worth it
i am addicted to my diet cokes so i rack up enough points to get free mcchicken s every once in a while
mcds is pushing others too so BK, wendys, taco bell and KFC are doing $5 meals but how long can they afford it for?
I need to get better at ordering taco bell
and Sonic is doing a 1.99 meal. makes me wonder whats in that
i just order the sharables 40 nuggets and 2 large fries and after you use 20% off from app ordering cupon its like 12 something
honestly, food service is a bubble that's gonna pop. The costs it takes to realistically run the business do not add up to the price customers are willing to pay
I mean...still gotta check ya know?
Out of pure curiosity at the end...I kinda wanna see know what was in the basement. Buuut this race not run
Well yeah after killing Ganon lolz
omg he missed a chest!! he's throwing!!! *internal spaz*
its fine, you have fairy tears
I still have to learn lja lolz
ive always hated this dungeon. not because of the size but because its a sky temple... im always scared im going to fall so i end up doing it super slow
You mean like fall back to lake hylia?
thats not how you triple item wheel buffer phanto274Rage
Are you guys waving back and forth? Lolz
does blight do more to argorok?
I need a minute to digest that comment
the black hearts threw me off for a second lol
Bot talking about zenoblade is cool
God this fight is so long I alway forget
@str9ngest9r i had the same scare earlier haha
I want to get a setting made for 2/3 health for phase 2
Yeah and that way Ordon sword isn't miserable either
Also much easier to use tears on Stallord
ive seen someone do it dont remember who
listen Zelda, it was necessary to break all those pots to save your life
Link showing off his skills by spinning his sword in hand
Ganon’s death face how everyone racing is feeling
sub 2:45 better than anythign i could ever do
The dorf screams as I’m about to make two eggs
Anni, you still wanna know about basement?
Never sure why Ganon decided to wear a rug as a cape
Pocky found the kaka gorge sword first
@AnniLyn2 city in the sky, the room you logically need it for
Axl I still wanna know basement lolz
Actually no you literally have just about everything. Basement knowledge unneeded
was there anything behind lantern, I know it was 4th floor in lakebed
May I has those seeds? phanto274ColonD
FYI we prioritize hinting a barren dungeon, so if you don't get one then none of the dungeons are barren
Pocky doesnt have any fused marked so i think forest is their first dungeon finished?
Maybe just a bomb bag or something
Oh yeah if the bug led to bomb bag then it would also be good and prevent barren
arent you glad you found bow at the lake so you didnt have to do ice block puzzle KEKW
Peaches did the skippable ice block
I HATE that puzzle...the last one always gets me
Didn’t require Bow because Toybox wasn’t required Kappa
I think I won my first race off of a sword there lol (before hints)
I kind of wanna...know if you can grab onto argorok like normal...
And then use a bomb arrow on him point blank
i glad I didnt play this
But do you know what DDR is
Dry Dry Ruins checks out to me
Imagine if this was a qualifier
Amish, when you picking up TPR?
pretty sure that’s how ddr is used colloquially too Kappa
Amish we can practice together! phanto274ColonD
I don’t mind watching but haven’t played enough Zelda to want to do a rando
I might start doing some more key time rando for Pokémon but we’ll see. did enjoy the sub AP world
I’m gonna do Crystal next month I think
I always call ooccoo "Oh cocoa"
I’ll keep that mind for first time doing it
I’ll love that for my old muscle memory lol
i just cheat with clawshot anything
Gotta be an all rounder to make it to the top
Can I have seed link so I can try in a couple of days?
Epileptics have a horrible memory Phan...I dont even remember where Axl told me where the other clawshot in the seed I made...and that was yesterday
Yeah I really like those ones
It's always deceiving when you get thrown bunch of items
The first seed I made by myself...that's what happened. I got thrown a bunch of items and didn't have a sword what felt like forever...finally found but only up to ordon sword
This one's a run not race so leggo phanto274Mash phanto274BLANKIES
I have that cradle fall through the ground 50% of the time I throw it
It like hits the ledge and then falls through
The ones they put up in completed seeds...have you ever played the most recent ones?
You got lakebed and city again?
Round 2 boogaloo incoming.  Last seed redux
I was gonna ask was it good xD
Never mix sweet and salty in one lolz
you were brave for trying that
I hope it was a single and not like a 2 pack or something
Hey it was that thing I asked about before
I started going to SG early because I thought "I'm going to have to double dip anyway"
Double dipping is bad in TP and irl
It's tempting to wait for a domrod
Okay...asking your preference on which dungeon is better
I couldn't tell you either lol
Im not entering the pape tourney but i am curious about how many have entered
I entered but have nothing going on this weekend for once so time doesn’t matter
I’m assuming if they get a certain amount they won’t be able to finish it all at once but phanto274Shrug
I feel your pain for 9AM, I did my mario party relay at 9AM and that was 5 hours long
1 hour 40 minutes less to a sord
I usually have dog wakes me up at 7:30 mountain time on weekends so what else am I gonna do
Master sword is 20x the value of a wooden sword
like if noon and 6 tied why not propose starting at 3
Yeah I’m gonna mention that in the channel too. maybe start a bit later than that
I get up at 7 usually lately...can't fall back to sleep til 10/11
You can do a timed bomb throw
You know he wasn't gonna throw that pot high enough
try throwing your sword next time
throw my 5 buck sword at it sure
I was going to say something, and then I remembered Link does throw his sword in the new games
ItemToItemPath is guaranteed (unless you had a really weird seed)
1 ItemToItemPath, 2 Path to boss
yeah BotW timeline swords have durability so throw one is useful when the sword is about to break
"yeah peachy come do a quick race with us!"
i finally got memo after completley clearing the overworld
all i needed left to do was fight dumb fuck mcgee argorock with ordon sword, go get ms in desert, fight morpheel, THEN do ganon? fuck that
would've taken me a whole other hour
yeah nah i just had bad pathing ig, nothing new for me
dcs was uhhh lantern check in gorge?
there is when you're out of checks
thats what it was, after forest temple and water temple, i was just running overworld bcuz i had litterally no toehr checks
no more weekday seeds y'all are killing me
paper amrio still feels shorter to me
i had a very rough start let me just say
oh you do the weird dot method
i was SO MAD when i went into lake hylia
gods im never aknowledging a check that says "skippable" ever again i was SO MAD
i really need to include lake hylia in my first routing
the race started and I was like "oh no Phantom. Pocky is doing vanilla!" phanto274D
You get a heart! You get a heart! And YOU get a heart!
like i saw fw and ff was barren, so i did zora and then just got a kerfuffled
nah man when i saw the prologue wasn't autoskipping i was SO CONFUSED
then i realized i didnt run the dang rel loader adn LOST MY MIND
I saw goat guy in front of links house. OH NO
but obviously, what is 5 minutes in regards to racing against y'all
five minutes isnt gonna be what kills me in a race
so i wasn't gonna make y'all restart
barely any time at all, jsut went back to menu, deleted save, ran rel loader
was like 5 minutes at that point
like i said, small times like that isn't what kills my run
but also im never joining a last minute seed ever again thx
ninja was harrasing me to join bcuz we were in a discord call
Do you have to stream it to race?
I didnt even see the ping for the race
You do for the tournament though
manh your layout is so clean im jealous
*studies intently even tho im not going to try and emulate it*
i just feel like mine is very crowded i can only fit tracker and the game and timer lmao
the oldest clip I have of Phantom is ironically my favorite
Komari: hey try this lotto code LUL
Did you ever do that check in EF?
my layout is cute and asthetic, but it is very difficult to have any kind if compolicated stuff on screen
like you got timers, chat, last subs and cheer, ad starting (i need that, that i would like to figure out), a whole section of tracker, and cams
adn the game taking up the best portion of your screen
To the iron boots!! Wherever they are lolz
Ouro convinced me to move splits/tracker to the left and gamefeed center focus cause twitch chat is always on the right
me during the race on the weekend getting bnc in stalfos grotto
it was my rambo moment tbh
What if the rest of the items are in hylia lantern cave
It had all bomb bags and lantern all behind B&C in stalfos grotto
So you had to come from Lanayru Field
that was the seed from the weekend yeah it was
its very gross and i had to do it today, was not a fan
i game overd in this grotto
"just have Phantom generate all the seeds so they're all sub 1:40s"
i go into bombskit with full health and just get tanke because i can never rememebr exactly where the chests are
was surprised you didnt use it for rock bomb chest
anyways i need to go to bed it is very past my bedtime
wolf link has strong paws to catch himself there
I'm sorry but I can't be Jesus christ
My ass hurts after this seed (real)
how much time do you spend on titles?
"The Return of [title already used]"
I voted for Clawshot get amazing positions for them
when was your last sub 830?
Maybe the last seed be... started off so well
so we found the loose sword
Not until the very last check
watch city of the sky have logical next sword again
Unless you can do rang + bombs
Can you take off boots and then use the sword to get in there
There might be a really specific setup with rang targetting
play on wii and use the magnet thing without iron boots
Try the bomb rang a little furtger
No it'd hit the other ones
the last seed called you, says I’m back to haunt you
anyone want a japanese Pichu with surf?
I have spent hours on this room and still don't think I have it fully figured out
It's a good example of how CitS gives back what you put into it
What if we put all of the items in the worst room in the game
the last seed called, it wants its gimmick back
we should give you the role "city in the sky enjoyer" KEKW
wait can we just ask for items
okay psychic, call out the next item
whats the worst boss in 3d zelda history and why is it argorok
have you done casual non-rando argorok recently?
its infinitely faster with strats tho
one thing to note about pokemon box, I have to use a modded version to import japanese mons. It doesnt work with vanilla.
KICK THE SHIT OUT OF THAT STUPID DRAGON
you go left 2 and lower when the fire hits the hover thingy before you i think
i think thats third cycle strat
So why was the last seed bad did game just spite you specifically
this seed got a sword 20 mins in
do you have the foler with GBi settings? when I setup my GBi I only had the 3 versions to run it. normal, high fidelity, and speedrun
It's near the right edge of the pillar with a single target
Idk how it works, but that is the setup lol
what a loop though from GM to CitS to LBT and back to GM
Yeah I usually don't do it when testing by myself
Going to grind it out before the tourney though
Since you have to do it every seed
Oh sure. On these settings or different?
That works. Just send me all of the details like a week before and I'll take care of it.
and they were amusing Clawshots indeed
type of jerk chicken? the one that says fuck a lot
hey no profanity in the chat please now can i have mod
thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day and bye YouTube
i want glundo as a thin lil line
nah I can't. fiancee still awake
I usually wait til she sleeps
It's time to play Wheel of SpeedRuns! phanto274GL
wheres tp rando on the wheel
I typed up a sick ass route
wheel of morality turn turn turn. show us the rando we should learn
i haven't seen dog island  or mario 3d world 243 star
I don't think I've ever seen dog island
Oh no wait. I forgot Charmy existed
Are the gunshots in the OG game?
Fucking wild. I thought it was a super edgy fan addition
So the wheel chose the shittiest one to start
Almost in time for his chronicles too
Also SHUT THE FUCK UP CHARMY
thank god I returned right as charmy shut up
gonna be start an emerald hack soon. All it does is buff treecko to match up better with the other starters. Like evolving it get dragon typing.
its an early look at what emerald legacy wiill be
yellow and crystal already hav elegacy hacks
it changes a lot, like in yellow I found the old rod in viridian city, went back to pallet and fished up a poliwag. Even NPC text boxes are accounted for to explain new stuff
the really cool thing about crystal is gyms 5 6 and 7 scale depending on the order you do them in. They put in a lot of work so im excited for emerald
i didn't even know you speedran this game
i've never played this one lol
are there any randos on the wheel?
what if you roll shadow again lol
oh god, you put pm glitchless on here
just do minish cap any% but without glitching
do you still rng manip at the start?
oh hey i know this game
dang, ttyd ACE is outta control
isnt minish cap on switch good too
i think gamecube games work like that too
but we're not afraid of a little corrupted save file, right?
i know you can reset while saving in animal crossing anyway and it will wait until the save is done
Wait what did I miss first??
Aw man...I like poking jokes at tails voice lolz
Had to fix twitch...idk why but it's a bit off
How many bits to those subs?
No but hearing it is like man
phanto274Lurk gl i'm fighting with youtube mp4 downloaders
Can't help when I wanna man...a birthday this Saturday and also next week
oh my god it worked ty so much! it downloaded the video extremely fast too
sub goal to do an mm rando?
Replace tp with mm and you got a deal lolz
always wondered how you had your row of golds on you splits and now ive figured it out
im ready for the hotel mario minigame LUL
oh cool! pretty early in the stream. Hey guys!
i wonder how animal crossing runs on the ique lol
animal crossing on N64 is weird, you dont even have a run button
you can run with z on n64
I told him he didn't have to :|
Anni told me you were 10 gifted away from something
i haven't seen any of them
Now I'm out of uh...fast food requests for a week evo17KO
wait, you're telling me we don't cheat there in glitchless?
when i was a kid i got stuck at this part
and never beat the game until i was an adult lol
i have 2 iq as a kid
I took me forever to find that
tbh that kind of glitch feels like luigi skip to me. so easy to accidentally do that you should just allow it
i couldnt beat this game but i somehow beat mm as a kid lol
this have by far the hardest final boss in a zelda game
was totally normal gameplay there YEP
why would they give you the gust bellows if they didn't want you to do that?
so what's the lore reason for link only being able to grow/shrink at cracked square rocks
Just need a tiny hole and Ezlo
theres one in mm that is super annoying lmao
it sure is convenient that those doors seem to open right when the minecart comes by
well that would be a glitch
I mean...probably got busted open when the train ran into it
currently superbly madge at my controller cus the stick drift on my right stick makes playing pikmin a challenge for no reason
so with other words: glitched played doing glitchless moment
cus thats roughly what my brain makes from that
what is the name of the magic wand item?
When boss keys were in the same room
wiggling the sword is so effective
truly a master of the blade
aaand I realized I kinda foooked myself cus I enabled something, now I am sad
comes with figuring out retroachievements I guess
didn't you give them a blue sword...?
what in the world did they do to it???
cringe by the looks of it
the color CLEARLY is tied to some magic
they just put a green coat of paint on it and called it fixed
clearly what it needed was a RED coat of paint
wait ezlo wasn't always a hat
does that mean i also might not actually be a hat??
damn he just like me when the microwave beeps
One of best zelda games...but which one is more time consuming?
is that what they're calling it these days? "the books?
did I ever tell you a beetle hissed at me once when I picked it up?
that is very not cool @OhHeyItJaye
You sure if wasn't a hissing roach?
it was 4th of July and I picked up those white and black striped ones and it just started hissing at me so I put it down. I went to go pet it and it hissed again so I was like, I'm done PrideLaugh
r***h should be a banned term IMO
but no, it wasn't a roach, it was beetle sized PrideLaugh
Dude there are some large roaches lolz
there are yeah, but I knew it was a beetle due to its shape, wings, and how their legs feels
and they come out in summer here
like beetles, butterflies and moths I love, but other bugs, GO DIE LOL
I have a feeling starry doesn't like insects lolz
oh and praying mantis'. those things are cool
i will never forget one day in one of my college labs there was a spider on the wall and this dude just walked up and fucking punched it
That key location was horrible lolz
I would never punch it, but I do hate spiders LOL
Praying mantis is so cool to watch fight
I don't think I've ever seen them fight ohheyi30Hehe
Omg i was gonna ask if you ever pet a spider
AND TOO MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN COMING IN THE DAMN HOUSE
But they're so hairy and feels funny
i saved a turtle the other day
No no like...a spiders head is bumpy like compared to their body
turtles are very cute though PrideUwu
but it was kinda fast for a turtle ngl
sometimes where i live we have softshell turtles wandering around and those guys are so funny-looking
if y'all have not seen a softshell turtle do yourself a favor and look it up
I'll look it up if you look up a certain bug star lolz
Gotta look up soft shell turtle
I think so? but it's a little more rare here
ok i regret looking up centipede those are scary
I was gonna say house centipede lolz
Softshell turtles look like snakes in a shell...it's neck xD
I'm sorry I couldn't help it
But imagine what a millipede would be like compared to a centipede
ok i have seen a millipede and for whatever reason those are way less scary than centipedes
I didn't think I was playing with millis as a kid...thought it was a rolly polly
Where's the option for the wheel to spin on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet?
DLC is cool when done right
He looks cool, so that's a pass
even Zelda 1 as DLC is insane, so many callbacks
I think it's really stupid that mirror shield is post game
It's about as pointless as the ALTTP Mirror Shield
It's ugly as sin and lags the game
Gotta play a whole ass side game for post game stuff
but some good side game stuff
ah yes, wheel chose Minish Cap first! LETSGO
I remember getting stuck at this stupid dungeon
And my favorite minish cap item
Keep the faith, brother. You got this.
how long was that there lol
it’s okay I was cooking I could see how spammy it was
wait this isn't four sword adventures
can’t wait for Vaati to be an asshole
every minute we get closer to pape
This wheel needs subspace co-op with MVD
we need the world record displayed because this is definitely wr attempts
hey this isnt links awakening glitchless
this game is so incredibly charming
no no, it’s the PAL version Feli
Gotta get the gamba simulation going pepeMeltdown
I come back to Kirby!! phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Mash
I come back from dindin and such and I see two streams speedrunning Kirby 64 PrideLaugh
I never uploaded my 1:15:XX run to SRC. oops 3:
omg this is my favorite level
this music takes me back :')
GL w/ run Phan...gonna head out
those cannons are really accurate, sheesh
i still haven't ever played LAS
if you find a trick good enough to deserve its own category make it but don't make it glitchless KEKW
so they wanted dumb trick that someone spent a lot of time on figuring out to be in so that person didn't feel bad
that's the impression i get basically
the wheel thing is a cool idea
i should expand my speedrun repetoire more, i went to think about submissions for gdqx maybe and it was "oot... tp... botw... oot... tp..."
true but i do also like metroid KEKW
Simply run more games to make the wheel bigger
I'm just saying Mario is Missing any% is under half an hour
Wait i showed up just in time
We lost so many celebrity dogs this year
Kabosu the face of dogecoin and now another internet dog passed away today
Wait, do the dogs have houses? Or are there people on the island?
Does anyone here follow the internet dogs?
THEY HAVE JOBS?!?!  I'm in love
the fact that this is 2.5 hours long is impressive
Belgian Manois, even more upfront guard dog
More than anything else in the world
It's neat that you can choose your dog breed here
never thought there would be such a sad story in a dog game
you mean you're also going to get milk for 5 years
Jesus christ for a cute game about dogs that plotline is BLEAK
D: did i hear that right
I hear they're by the sea shore
I don't think that dog has his veterinary license
I'm a cat owner but I understand all pets
I'm curious on how many dog breeds are in the game and hoo boy
It's interesting if you look up all the breeds and their characteristics IRL
Oh gods Chihuahuas are in this and they're known as the devil's dog with their attitudes
I wanna see the beagles. My puppy's a beagle mix and she's the cutest
She also not a puppy, she's like 7
Do the 9ther dogs make it out alive!??!?!
Just lie to me and tell me they do
do the dog breeds have different stats
I love how goofy these wii era originals are
Of course there's well known stuff like Huskies, Beagles, Shibe, GSDs, Dalmatians, Pomeranian, Akitas, Poodles, Golden Retrievers
A beagle. Just like my sweet Toby. She would be a terrible dog-tor though
Samoyeds aren't here which would have been interesting with their looks being giant fluffy white clouds
Dog landlords are still leeches though
damn wish my landlord would let me pay by exorcising cute spirits
No Alaskan Malamutes here either which are just Huskies but muscle dogs instead of racing dogs
@cdent_ to be fair, have you tried?
Landlords hate them, for this one simple trick!
the fact that there's combat baffles me
PETA would have a field day
I love it either way honestly
I mean certain dog breeds were bred to hunt bears
Yeah, my dog was supposed to be a hunting dog for some piece of shit, but she's too sweet and doesn't chase animals
Oooh duh of course my bad
I should've known the dog would have am axe
Imagine if choosing your breed had an effect on what your character is good at
Just like how certain dog breeds are bred to do IRL
Hear that kids? If you rub ashes in your eyes, you'll see spirits!
I bet he's rolling around in cat shit. That's what my dogs doing when I'm not paying attention
Is there drifting in the movement? It looks like it, but it could just be animation
I thought there was gonna be a burning house or something, so I guess this is better
Why can't the witch-dog just heal our sibling?
Why didn't we start with the all cure flower? I'm starting to think this dog-tor is a grifter
Dog-friendship truly is the most powerful friendship. Climate change GTFO these dogs are cuddlimg
yo is this THEE dog island!? Wowee
I legit wanna try this game now KEKW
i assume the JP version is faster?
Now I'm just imagining humans bald dudes just running around on all fours sniffing
this legit looks well made why have i never heard of it till phantom played it? KEKW
damn i really been missing out 😔
This game also has translation errors
Wait shit do I need an Ubisoft account to play this game? I'm out
figured it was one of those games they made with the motion controls in mind
oh nice they even made the best wwe games  day of reckoning 1 and 2
from wrestling to dog RPG of course KEKW
Dalmatian with firewood, thought they were mascots for firefighters
i see what they did there
Nobody likes fires more than firefighters tho
i thought it was dog-speak for a compass KEKW
Nobody could possibly comprehend how that works
..... is a retirement house real or is this dog dead
oh yeah theres combat in this game KEKW
I'm gonna go find a gang and challenge them to their mini-games to become leader
idk alex sounds kinda based and smart
Wait, is that guy the "Bandit Keith" of Dog Island?
I've never met a Curtis I liked
Curtis is a mean person name
And she never sent a text huh. Kinda rude tbh
Yeah, that's how phobias and trauma works for sure
well at least its realistic i guess KEKW
Jesus are you gonna have to sit and die in a hot car next

Oh so he's tryna sniff that butt
Do you get a dance number?!?!
Is there a natural day and night cycle? What do.they do?
Still no level up on that battery though Kappa
Not filling the hearts is kind of unnecessarily brutal
Feels good going down the snout

it was good! played some dbd with friendos
iiiiis BORIS!! [ gopnik music intensifies ]
lara croft is in the game now lol
but we need a dog character frfr
smells are a state of mind
every game gotta have annoying bat enemies
Or unless you're a Husky, Malamute or Samoyed
If only you were a Husky
They enjoy pulling sleds and racing around everywhere
And causing CHAOS if you don't properly let them run around and get tired
oh i'm not muted anymore lol
why did that turn into the raid message, copycats
that dog has a huge face
you're finding the cure to cancer in this game
that plot explanation keeps me up night ever since you told me about it
for him to... dip his stick into... gotcha
the menu effects remind me so much of old harvest moon games sound effects
if you've ever played a wonderful life
lmaoooo and raven told ME not to be rude
I could of swore i remember a line of big head dogs
that polar bear is heckin cute
thats one hell of a thing to lose saheer
I would've thought dogs would like balloons
I feel like I'm having a stroke watching this LOOOOL
oh so you can just steal his girl
this game is so messed up man wtf grimmp4Cry
why do they all have sunglasses
the world has nothing else to offer a dog who has sniffed 100 things
Fear not the dog who has sniffed 100 things 1 time, rather, the dog who has sniffed 1 thing 100 times.
I was *this* close to making that joke
but I couldn't since I sent the original message
idk, cancer feels like kind of a cop-out
why isn't it an original dog disease smh
I'm not sure if that's better or worse LUL
man yeah at least subaru didn't have to cure cancer
seems like a lot of responsibility for a single marketable toy-like dog and a shadowy mouse thing
this dog is going through it man
does the snake killing you create an alternate timeline where the sky whale destroyed both worlds?
oh no, it’s the :) split
did you save the sibling dog

Yo Raven i beat trails through daybreak already
I haven't beat reverie yet lol
i really enjoyed trails through daybreak cant wait for part 2
LMAO THE BOT IS MONITORED CAUSE I BANNED IT IN MINE INSTEAD OF REMOVING IT
KEKW i am playing zzz as we speak
I tried it and would rather play honkai 3rd so I played honkai instead lol
It's the same mechanics exactly except it's way faster and more expanded upon
Shit dont freeze when I tag

yea i cant play it on my phone
Definitely a way to do it, unconventional but I think it makes things interesting if players can manage the time commitment and fatigue
level 9 take about 1 hour and 30 mins
even faster if you skip story
I'll start a new acc for you somepoint this week
I dont mind playing it I just like honkai better lol
I'm level 32 on the ps5 version
Round 1 finished all within a pretty short span of time
my phone have 2gb of ram and like 4 gb of space free KEKW
Partially because several of the lower seeds DNF'd after their opp finished but keeps bracket progressing timely
So today I found out about japanese Ninja Turtles O V A  that has them henshin transform voltron style and what a trip that was. Also the theme song was sung by the same guy that did HEAD CHA LA. they transform and combine into 1 then fly into outer space to save the whole planet Cheer100
When I'm reporting, I'm waiting until the finish/DNF before I mark it on the bracket so it's convenient for me if every race ends at the same time
wheres féli? i miss her Sadge
The OVA was made just to sell toys lol
What if I was thinking of doing it myself
I saw anime tiddies and was like
Flying to the west coast even for me in the middle is always just cheaper lol
A plane ticket to twitch con for me is like 230
Lookin at EC events it's like 100 more than going west
But Lai is going to be at my house for a month and a half
So I'm not going to TC lol
The east coast sucks my ass
yay I made it to a stream!!
It's cheaper to fly a week earlier to Detroit, than it is to fly to AGDQ the day before
I would be offended if I ever clicked go live
Shit's so expensive to be subbed to 15 people
My active subs are phanto274GL alpharadW
When I learn enough ultrakill to do full act runs I will stream again
I’ve been trying to catch a stream for months LOL but my schedule is wild. but you got me into Paper Mario rando so I wanna support! glhf on your race!
He was paying for unity or something right
I love that for you Elex
Oh so Phantom, I did a deep cleaning on my SNES controller last night. Soaked everything, replaced the dpad rubber, cleaned off the sensors
im only subbed to 3 people, one being you and one of those is 75 months
I think I only actively pay for 2 rn
I just get gifted in the other chats I sit in lol
You get your last 3tank right before draygon in both
Phantoon with no suits, and Ridley with 2 e tanks
how many stickers does that come with?
If someone offered me 1,000$...I'd probably say screw everything
i beat sonic 1 and 2 the first time like 3 months ago
how fertile is your soil today?
my race with amish had 6 be entirely in go-mode
My degenerate mind thought something else and I feel bad now lolz
getting a lot of early syrups
@axl_sr so I'm gonna finish the tp seed before I make another okay? Unless you wanna make it
Mario coating himself in syrup before getting in the whale lmaooo
@elexvtuber he wants the whale to experience joy lolz
@AnniLyn2 sure thats fine, have fun
@axl_sr are you gonna make it or me? I still need that info lolz
know whats crazy? Your total playtime in minutes has almost caught up to how many episodes of one piece there are KEKW
this race is the wano arc
My cat Lou just farted next to me while sleeping...has not moved an inch
He is a lady's man. I call him Mr. Steal Yo Girl as a funny
oh wait, I said minutes... I meant hours
to bad shards are worthless this seed
youll get atk FX but not slow go fifiLeave
well.. unless you wanna get damage dodge
Omg he farted again... someone help me evo17KO
So many partners in quick succession!
Vanilla is so good for banana shakes... but vanilla bean is better
oooh I love a banana shake 😩
I've made that too... not a fan of chocolate so I have it to my STB MIL
that mole will now have a nice scarf to stay warm in the winter…?
might end up missing some of the run. got another storm coming in
the joys of living in florida. storm every evening
please send some storms to Dallas please. the heat is killing me 😭
I miss florida but at the same time... don't
im moving later on this evening back to alabama. florida is just to hot for me
i get like 4 minutes outside before im drinched in sweat. hate it here
Guess you don't come this way very often, huh
One of these things is not like the others
Oh also did you finish doing that 2xko thing
what is 2xko? i heard max dood talking about it
2xko is a dogshit name LOL
Pete wants to run it locally so I wanna play the beta so I can duo with jibca
goombario is a mummy now lol rip
you can have goombario then homeward shroom skipping the fight lol
the stone chomp dealing 7 makes me wince lmaooo
I was gonna say the exp is worth it
Never would've asked for anything else lolz
Well that was riding... spouting ink on everyone lolz
What is wrong with swype lately... *rude
okay but you definitely did not hit that shy guy LOL
This seed has been a pretty good funnel so far
dopes megapaul normally stretch his pape rando? Its wider than Adam's
sushie can swim on lava, sure she can XD
Glad to see Laki is sick of this shit already
yo sushi in the lava? nice cooked fish
@Axl_SR The aspect ratio is only weird on the restream so no
That should be the hardest boss by far until ch8 though
a little water for ya after that lp fight Lol
ugh my dasher stole my order and just marked it as delivered ;_;
I hate when they do that crap @mirby_studios
yeah it's only happened a few times out of the many many times i've ordered
i already reported it as undelivered and got a refund tho lmao
for some reason they put it on the short stone wall on the other side of the sidewalk instead of by my door
they still didn't send a pic so i could refer to that tho so that's on them
so food AND money back? lmao
that happens to me all the time. like literally two days ago. they delivered it to my neighbor’s house and I was like “refunded” lol
i had someone deliver to the housing complex next to mind. like that place is bricks mine is not
so like that was an easy "undelivered" cause you WENT TO THE WRONG PLACE
Rowf just gave you a new pair of Skechers before your trek into the desert
Just got back from a lurk, are you in go mode?
I have trouble blocking that all the time lol
i was told  mobile emulator on pc doesn't work Sadge
i got to say zzz have been the most nice to me starting off
smh my head took one second too long and ruined the palindrome
That match is on the restream rn, looks like it will be a while
Required 6-scaled moles, Laki, and Huff and 7-scaled Koopa Bros for something unknown on Rowf 2
pulll them up on stream and we watch?
lmao i went to do the sponsor but my phone can't run the game
are all current racers playing the same seed you just played?
are they playing the seed you just did?
having to beat anti guy to get open seven would make me cry lol
Looks like PinkReaper beat hallway before DNFing FYI so only a few minutes behind
I think Adam died to Huff at least once
begone with your bot viewers you heathen
wow 2 in ten minutes... thats insane
Yeah this is the last game remaining in r2
Started like 20-30 minutes later plus... this seed...
Amish Levias was the first restreamed race, Daltior Drak was also surprisingly close
And ended up with an upset
probably. adam is a whole boss behind
huff at seven scale would make me sweat
go for the kill... not the boost?
That almost happened if he got the Watt block
is it super jump that lets you jump on an enemy multiple times?
I hope my next run I do tonight has good badges lol
Fernando theoretically favored but DRAK has been playing really well today
good idea i'm gonna go watch that phantom person, if they're streaming
Yeah DRAK was originally in group 5 but has been getting times on par with group 2, that losers match will likely be close
So are you doing your second race today?
Actually looks like Drak just has been playing really well today in particular, only had 1 sub-2 before today but then got a 1:45 and a 1:50 today
What song is this? or where is it from? lol
trying to remember what stage this is
i just played this game again you'd think i'd remember lmao
arcade was colorman. could also be brightman i honestly can't remember lmao
even if brightman's a pain in the ass and i hate him
beat the game with no armors bought (heatarmor's forced on you so you get that one), beat zero with and without source code (just save before getting it, beat him, then reload and get it and beat him and continue from there), buster only all bosses in simulator, and get all chips and PAs. and S rank all navis too
yeah the buster only HAS to be in simulator but you can get the S ranks in the initial fights too
all chips is missable cause you need to get the source code to get Zero's navi chip
so if you beat zero without getting the source code (for that one) that makes those missable
thus what i did and just beat him, get the achievement pop, then actually grab the source code and use that as my proper playthrough lol
We may be slowing down the schedule from the original plan so this may be the last match of the day regardless
I got snacks on the way from DoorDash. let’s see if they get left at my neighbor’s house
just don't do what i did and report it as undelivered if it was delivered and you overlooked it
Group 1 all matching their seeds so far
love a good pair of boots from a tree
Drak came surprisingly close to upsetting Nsingman but not quite
ah yes the turquoise turkey in toy box
oh yay shy guys are bullies
@MarioManTAW Drak put up some very good times today
thanks! I'll see you next round!
Trying to get another PB seed? Kappa
maddy wanted dinner and they just dropped it off at our neighbor's place
at least this dasher LEFT A PHOTO
I love playing a scavenger hunt with my door dasher
should message the dasher and tell them at least they tried
long time viewer, I like your content
how much to require fishing in the rando iceblueSmug
mega bomb wouldve been like 7FP probably
mmmm sushi. I'm already anticipating next year's trip to Sushi Train
oh nice, yeah, that does seem likely
my couch is available if you need it
I thought he moved to the midwest
by like 6 whole minutes peache114Heart peache114Heart
It was a very nice seed
we didn't have city as a req, so it was a very nice sed
and i just had good luck with my pathing, made smarter pathing decisions etc
So which items do you need to beat the game? I've never actually played this one all the way through
interesting. So the items required change every time. That's nice. Different from TPR where you always need the same items
Thanks Elex... just went to make food and clean dishes
Guys...furnados are oddly satisfying to watch
guess it's easier for her to squirt :)
well hey, Bombette can explode really easy too
ey i called it. 7 FP yay
I didn't mean her anger LOL
i mean yea... have you seen the boys?? first episode lady exploded everywhere
Tubba likes to hide his keys underwater
2 plants = 1 plant fight
saw how quick bombette and sushie could explode and squirt and had to leave the area
Where did he come from xD
what was red station access? I missed what you grabbed
okay gotcha. didn’t see what it was.
It sucks I can't play that...I really wanted to see what it was
what happens if Taste T cooks a lime and a coconut?
ah yes. a scarf for the cold winters in the volcano
I gotta clean up some stuff so brb
Jr said how dare you leave our fight. lmao
I mean, Laki does help with volcano too
Wait...woah. I pulled down to exit and saw Evo!
throw his gift back in his face lol
Is that a revive from pokemon? Looks like it
did you check shop in mansion? i cant remember
just in case you lose count
dang 3 in one stream. someone is getting popular
The evo restream I have on keeps swapping to anime shit I dont wanna watch so I gotta keep pulling up sf and tekken tabs LOL
napping again, otherr stream I was lurking in raided you but dont rememberr who it was lol
how long until we can exclude yoshi chief?
Trying lard in rice cooking this time with a bit of vinegar
It's to make the rice cleaner
if I soaked paper mario in water and added grain spawn would he grow mushrooms
had red key the whole time, never marked it on the tracker :)
you're not a true rando player until you forget to mark something and it kills your run
those are the rules i don't make them
Not sure tbh but yeah we might stay on the original schedule like that

feeds being stretched is bothering more than I thought it would
Hey Phan...forgot the race was today haha
I uh... just wanted to know how to use nintendont...
looks about just under a minute time difference
May also be slightly closer than it looks since Adam's stream is delayed about 7s
IDK why but Adam's been using Mega when Power would work, maybe more confident on that action command or something
I never use power shock when mega shock is an option
Adam now 26s ahead on card touch
I'm playing this game rn with a mod i found
It just replaces mario with Toadette
Close but also Rigby burned a lot more resources
I just got my favorite partner
no check is worth it at this point
does adam know this is a race? phanto274Smile
I feel like Rigby knows Bowser AI well enough to not die
got a lightning for getting to peril
the lightning definitely helped not getting a heal proc PrideLaugh
Amish missed something important for a long time and DNF'd
hey, how did the second race go against paul? i missed the last half
^ get a 5 minute head start
im predicting this seed is going to be super jank and youre going to start either bombette
So is this going to be another PB seed? LUL
Did you like the Kirby anime?
@Axl_SR the kirbo anime was soo good
and yes ik its been super child oriented ^^ still tippiTap
Dedede had such a good voice lol
I wanna go for shiny celebi but i dont wanna play through all of crystal so I might look up a speedrun guide
max stompees from the start? easy dubs
hey, you wanna buy this goomba? its cheap.
@Vixey_Lycan keep the lil' bastard, he's worthless
@buff00n oh come on, i’ll cut you a deal. you buy this handsome little guy and ill give you another for free? two goombas for the price of one.
the second one comes with a ponytail
your routing is on point today lol

pink boomy gonna be in ruins??
so the bot got a bluesky acc, aha I see phanto274Notes
okay, then just play better Kappa
Interesting, though I wouldn't say the best, I have experience with BN3 at most
TeamBN has some lua practice files for experimentation, that would be a good place to start.
Wow okay, that's a lot of Star Points lol
just bought super mario rpg on sale, so guess I'm starting my catch up game on the classics finally
I got my copy from gamefly a few months ago
Nice! Which version, Switch or SNES?
I'm too broke for real retro lol
I have the actual card and an SD2SNES
i bought my sd2snes BECAUSE of how bad snes prices are
some of my friends are.... maniacal retro collectors, it's horrible when we go retro shopping. I mostly look for used current gen but those other two... HahaSweat
i got a snes mini. ended hp modding it for all the games. totally worth it
i used to be a collector, then realized that i'm just boarding literal gold mines
and sold most of my rare stuff
sorry. fat fingers on phone keyboard
I'm sure I'm in the same boat at this point
Mario has canonically been shown to have romantic inclinations toward Pauline, Peach, Daisy, and Donkey Kong 64's Nintendo Coin. It is up to you to determine what to do with this knowledge. Cheer100
my brother sold my N64 games once. he got horribly scammed too, I was so pissed
Good thing Daisy's loyal to Luigi
imagine selling 10 n64 games for 100 bucks, then giving half of that to that friend of his who had the glorious idea and then they bought a weird playing card set for magic tricks and YGO boosters from that money
@langepon my friend sold his copy of Partners in Time to GameStop for $7 when I told him I'd give 'im $20
sounds your friend said f your $20
@XKirby2 tbf, we were both broke af high school students, so I understood
I think Melee is over $200
I should sell this copy of Melee, I ain't playing this shit
Can't say how accurate that is, but that's what it's currently selling for
cuz playing Melee without UCF is pain
rip with all the support items
why's Cheeto hawking so many drugs (mushrooms) to you
Most of my games aren't longer complete-in-box, kinda curious how much that lowers some of them
I used to have the boxes, but they got pretty badly damaged for most of my games
That and eventually I couldn't store all the boxes
SMRPG for SNES is around $70 loose
Hey Phan...just checking up on the stickers idea. Any option on how to pay you for them?
only boxes / cases I have atm are DS, GameCube, PS2 and Wii
Yikes man...but I'm pretty sure you still got this in the bag knowing your skills
wow two at one time? thats insane
we know you put your blood sweat and tears into the community, but you don't have to literally do that
did you chop your own basil or something? Mushrooms?
i cut my finger once with a butter knife. step dad mad fun of me for it. boy how in the heck do you cut yourself with a butter knife. skills
I've cut myself with a plastic spoon so
just want to say that was an impressive use of resources. Exactly 1 HP and 0 FP at the end of that fight.
not even a safety save monkaS
aight final battle. KICK HIM IN A DICK
way more intense then it should be
I will say Bowser was being shit though
also holy when did bowser install that double health cheat
at your go mode nsingman was missing diamond stone and 1 tubba key. When you started Tubba heart fight he just used the portrait. And they entered starway when you started final. Youre early game routing was the better of the two.
didnt he know banjo kazooie's a different game entirely KEKW
you were much further than hime
jeez dude that was close fight. g fraking g
to be fair it's a low bar to clear for your next match's bowser to be better
That was and extremely risky and painful fight
we gonna spy on their runs?
wait, is grands going to be today???!!!
It's exhausting but doing the tournament like this is is hypeE
speaking of shadow the hedgehog voice lines i found an old screencap i should share with you
Sucks that it took so long on final bowser
My fiancee's sister was over yesterday, I told her I was in the loser's bracket and she said that makes sense lmao
I think Fernando might be on Youtube? He was in my chat the other day but then I couldn't find his twitch channel so phanto274Shrug
top tierr content... watching someone else LUL
Oh snap, so this is Grand Finals?
man you gotta wait a while then, huh?
hey twitch we need a just waiting category for people waiting between tournament matches :P
I can't find it on youtube either Hmm
Lan art the airport was too good not to share LUL
did you notice the blue screen monitors in there?
Ah so you're in losers now?
Unfort run but good win ig lol
just make up some bullshit excuse like "my cat ate my controller"
Just say you need to get some galvanized steel and some eco-friendly wood veneer
i'm not doing a ten pack
i tried but my phone won't run it lol
but there are plenty of words on stream. i see Paper, Mario, Randomizer, Waiting, For, Losers
oh there go some of those words
@MarioManTAW why would you lower my defense
I wish it showed you after
also I come back and we playing werddssss
this is playing at 1% of the volume on the cyber sleuth title screen
the race room is active 👀
all g I must have been on cd still
we're rapidly getting to the parts i hate
i hope one of the os is fake
there i got one this stage
to be fair cock should count
WHY DO I KEEP USING L?
that L was huuuge bait hooly
so that was a word 🤔
there was a stage in make a good mega man level 3 that had kine as a boss lmao
isn’t kind the thing that used for…. nevermind
MY EYES, WHY YOU DO THIS
if you think it might be, test it tippiTap
oh but goth and cock dont count ey words?
I dunno what the hidden letter is
of course my internet would heck up
o7 to the C which c-aw us not winnin KEKW
there we go. now I'm back PrideLaugh
Of course Goombario has a cocnut
Nothing on Merlow, but AoN is 4 SPs
damn I need to do a rando again at some point
that and I need to do the RA set
I know it's a super easy one
wait, why would we need boo's portrait and the seed here if we're not going to those chapters?
I read the star backwards LOL
Yo Phantom, what is the Deep Sector 4 Remix? It's awesome
Oh, I'll have to check the VOD then, I wasn't paying attention
Who's ready for absolutely nothing (except 1 item) in Chapter 2?
Aww man, my Sunday afternoon was free. If they needed a comm I'd jump on in a heartbeat
I can't do it any differently than you two after the diagram
ASK AND THY SHALL RECEIVE (Nice Bucket)
Shell Shot's bad, Power Shell is great
did you ever play pikmin phantom? ik its somewhat off topic given pape PrideLaugh
tldr: its SUPER rough to get good at pikmin 1
Anyways, back on Kooper. I saw that upload, I know how good Kooper can be
for reference: retroachievements for some GCN games came about
and I now commited my brain to getting them all on the standard sets for pikmin 1 and 2
that being said? rough as shit
the last five cheevis though AAAA
the rest will be easy to get though
I've played Pikmin 3 and 4. 4 is super easy by comparison
all I have to say is gl PrideLaugh
problem is I play with built in handicap too KEKW
cus my right stick got drift
(Also no one but the hero knows how to drive apparently)
oh you're talking to someone who loves Pikmin PrideLaugh
@OhHeyItJaye see - I did get the full set in pikmin2 earlier
so now I kinda am in that spot where I proved to myself that I can convince my shitty ass controller to work with me
so rly, the most annoying one of the last 5 you're talkin about imo is the 1st of those
cus its a literal perfect - the rest has options
warehouse was somewhere in the beginning of the run
Feels like he missed a check maybe
yeah, the first being a perfect score at 279
M Smash is ok, 2 BP, 4 FP
Or doesn't have it marked maybe
my best is like a 211 LOL
218 for me it was, not being familar
I THINK I once had like a 250 on that one though
so I can definitely get there
just having to force the perfect there is not easy
yea nah you're fine jaye KEKW
Eh, there are 5 checks in there
have we had any rough seeds?
I will say I had no idea what to do with high scaled Tubba heart with what I had
but thinking about it later, I should have put more into BP
D Jump in Blue Key area
Or wait, no, 6 scaled. 2 is already 7 scaled
Okay I looked back WH key was Moustafa
I feel pain everytime he resets
Oh yeah, we have to full clear the whole game now looking for that
I also NEVER did Danger Mario in the tourney
checking the tracker will be inevitable
Yeah his tracker is like aaa
That tubba key is in the worst spot
Can still route it in on the way to ruins
Couldn't have played this seed much differently
Interesting megapaul does such a good buzzar skip but doesn't do Kooper puzzle skip
Tell the lovers to hurry up KEKW
Anymore races today after this or nah
Coming in to watch and seeing the "waiting for losers" took me aback for a second. Then I figured it out.
Yeah I don't think they could handle it tbh
i missed it, what did he get?
oh I thought he got something in the palace PrideLaugh
this might actually be a smart play
If he finds Record quick, I can see Rigby pulling through lol
2 chapter tubba keys in tubbas castle
i'm assuming record is palace key
We out here to get Peril
that's a nice play bot, but
there's a certain someone wincing right now cause someone used star storm
Since he knows the scaling of 6 by now, I would have assumed he would go
Though it could only be 6 right? Or my brain is thinking he went to other levels lol
but chapter 7 is so long
So I figure he would be ahead
Just cause 7 is so long
Getting out of Chapter 6 is also faster
Also what's paul's level vs rigby
he's giving rigby the lead by doing this
It' so easy to to get it on Huff though with wind
going for 9 damage on spikes
coulda ran a whole nother seed
he's not buffering, his internet just perished
someone must of turned on his microwave
Not like internet. So far ahead wise
so worried about the 4 cap there
It's annoying it's so much earlier than final
I pray for Rigby, Bowser could be a cluck
Gotta take what we can get
the text is funny to me
night all, have a good one!
Phantom5800 is now live! Streaming Paper Mario: Watching Losers Finals -> Grands match vs the winner | !socials #Ad !ZZZ
Are you ready for our rematch?
I'm about to throw words out that
i love the not shade shady text on screen lmao
Waiting for the losers to finish so winners can play
radish is an S tier catch blue
I think I was specifically engineered for games like this
double teaming 6 letters let's go
I'm pinning that in our dms phantom
Oh yeah gonna try the new table swift made?
I wonder if professional toe licker is a name not taken
Yeah that's mostly why I asked
I'm not falling for that one bitch
rigby said hes going for the reset
i bet that m ain't real
just like an m to be fake
wait that's a wrod I just wanted to glen
we just out here trying to glen honestly
Or take this L, your choice
we dont need to watch that
No way that's a shadow line
my god i wasn't ready for that LUL
Cheer100 Shadow: I'm so sad about the words I could scream kkona: whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,. whyyyyy,,,,,,.
damn d down and last stand
Cheer100 shadow: ok I'm better now
that block phased out of existence on him
If Rigby uses that I’ll eat my hat
Yeah rough start in that regard
Oh this is not what I expected
Hey think it's more fun watch here then in paperrando stream :)
I'm shocked he didn't just go to 5
You have most of 5 to do
Surely Nsingman didn't forget that Odd Key + Bombette is 5, right? monkaS
yup just can’t teleport up and skip the key
Sing is gonna kick himself later for this
Hate to see this be the way it's decided
It's weird cause he was literally in there
Singman doesn't realize he can go to 5 through rip cheato
Man what a way to lose, that’s rough I’ve been there
What a way to lose 15 mins qwq
Yeah the restream chat is discussing the fact he might forget the path exists bc it's technically not vanilla glitchless
IDK I feel like I haven't seen it very much recently...
I feel like I don't have it come up for me in blitz that often, definitely something I don't remember much of
Theoretically yeah but in practice it feels like either Watt or Sushie Boots come first
There's also the fact the wall doesn't have the bomb cue on Rip Cheato side if that matters
Yeah he was there at Cheato
i think he'll circle around to rip again tbh
I would quit once I realize :')
Rigby would have to die without saving or something
risky and get punished for sure
do we know 5 scale yet?
4,5,6,7 scale on required, commentator's curse
is it the totally legit flash cart i have?
needs to make risks and rigby would need to throw
i wonder if vanilla watt would be enough to get singman back in if he checks it
Wait where did key 3 come from?
Had to be in the fortress
Was it behind the toy block in blue?
Yeah it'd be between continuing 7, continuing 5, or winding path for Singman after this
stick drift sucks ass i had to buy a new ps5 controller cuz both my controllers had it Madge
I just threw my Xbox one away
I got drift out of nowhere
what are those joysticks that don't get drift at all?
I got a 8bitdo so I don't have to deal with it
i've only heard it said never read it LUL
my stick drift was so bad i couldn't switch my team on genshin
I will stand by the 8bitdo controllers for the Hall effect
I got the switch version of the controllers
it would be interesting if watt is vanilla
She was on the deep jungle
star stone need to be here
I bet volcano has them all
rip that bad think its gg for singman
Oh that was the key, got it
He ain't going to ch 1
Should go to 7 with what he has
i just got here, who's ahead?
was there anything under the frozen lake?
The timer doesnt continue even if he is ofline, right?
wait! So, it's still running for him? Or will they take out time for the downtime he wasnt playing?
Hard to say, seems like he is now finding things in a more optimal order but was really far behind to begin with
Ch. 5 should be low scaled, no?
seems managable. let's see how they play it out
Last time you got it before I saw it
Surely he's gaming. I bet he finished volcano by now
Rigby probably doesn't know his stream is dead tbh
oh right he’s got the x5 equivalent
I'd hate to play like that
Hopefully his OBS or whatever automatically tries to reconnect, otherwise this will probably be a 1-sided stream
wow i guess ch 1 should be next
oh if it’s Rowf Rigby has it sealed
what if he doesnt check ralph?
could just be top of ch1
Idk if it makes it worse rofl
Funny if it's top of ch 1
I want to see V. Vase be at Ralph to make them back track TriHard
At this point likely 10 mins?
i think it was around 1:07?
Yeah slightly less than 10 min difference as of volcano enter
Yeah Rigby made some misplays but it may not matter
sing jsut needs to leg it to ch 1
Routing makes more sense here if he thinks he wins the fight
i think he got like 3 life shooms?
if it takes too long, Bow should do him fine, no?
Yeah general guy is going to be rough
no bombs in this toy box
I wonder if Koop has the star
Maybe not if he did Fortress before storeroom
It may be slow but his pace is fast at least
bounce is probably not in logic
struggling but he will do it
Wait Jade Raven and Star Stone were literally swapped this seed
jade was in the cyrstal below the frozen palace
Rigby lost time finding both of them
Oh you haven't started yet lolz my fault
give it 10 or more minutes
heh, behind "Had time to equip a badge rather than level BP"
So about 7minutes apart at CK kill, will be rough
1 shroom and low SP is kind of a challenge
I bet even if he dies once or twice, he should be still ahead of time
I didn't see. did he have any gels?
GG to Rigby, good on NSingman making it this close
well, anyways, i wasn't expecting the finals to be today. i will be gone so i'll see you all later! <3
@AnniLyn2 yeah singman threw one at the end
@rvpa could be a melon...looks like a coconut
our level was old enough to drive
won't be here to watch, but glhf
going to shave my head while you race for good luck 💙
just think i've never been not bald when you've won HahaThink
I can't wait for when you're able to sell the sticks.... they look so fucking awesome!
Is it you against rigby or nsingman?
That's good... they were going through hell on that one
I have think there was one?
But the seeds were definitely slower
Racetime times only show the slowest finish/DNF time
Internet is reset and it seems stable
shitty timing but GG on getting through that
Once a day my router takes a shit
From general guy onward I was using mobile hotspot
@Rigby234 same time each day or rando?
You say not many 3x but not many people even have 3x PBs according to racetime
It was earlier than usual today
What kind of internet do you have? Or maybe need a new router?
that sounds like its too big a range to say, if ISP side DHCP for Outwards IP address tippiThink
plus I dunno if thats even done in Canada or not
That said it looks like the only 3xs this tournament were you vs PinkReaper and NSingman also got 3x vs Rigby
This seed was easy 3x if made the right plays
just comes as a thought given its done by ISPs in germany hence the question about whether its always same time of day - and during the day, it rly shouldnt
cus usually if ISPs do that, its scheduled for the nighttime hours
Yeah might be it, since it's normally at 8 or 9 it does that
oh right this is Culex theme
yea usually its either 1am, 2am, somethin like that
odd that its in "regular hours" so to speak if its what I am talkin about
It's gonna be a nice race
gl obv. to both of ya, may rando be rando and funs be had
I want more bacon and eggs rn..
Will you be playing another seed after the race?
I was gonna offer to join coms if no one else joined but I see they have jcog for it
gl Phantom, got plans I have to get ready for soon but will have it on the background phanto274GL
their new crispy chalupas not worthj
Should've went the risky route Phan
I did not find them impressive
U did a lot of badge farming
Have a couple 4lokos and do the race
I always hype it up in my brain then end up regretting
to me they were super dry, and I got the steak ones
I think my partner could one shot bonetail
this is gonna be a fun race lol
if you want an easy race against rigby just distract him with unite
Dude I'm definitely on the verge of passing out haha
I took some eyedrops and napped lol
restream has your streams up now
Cheer45 it's what I had left of my bits
Figured give them rather than have it sit there
wow already calling rigby a loser, didn't expect trashtalking to happen already
Not sure if this is visible but GL Phant
But everything I say is stupid xD
Got it, so make the usual jokes of "Have you checked Lake Hylia for progression?"
Want to see her naked? 🍑💦  onlyfans.com/alisonlilbaby/c17
is that a gold hammer lol
yeah i bot coming in is rough
Definitely was new though... don't think I ever saw OF link
the 1 time i tabbed out today and bot
my internet just shit the bed, all the streams are buffering for me phanto274Smile
its nice for me that your timers are only like half a second off
Went to get some popcorn...added white cheddar and buffalo wild wings seasoning lolz
How's the race going so far?
yeah that power bounce badge is not great 😬
i looked away and missed it
That was lucky you did that
oh it was a fortress key
Hii Phantom phanto274Smile how are you doing?
back! I see we’ve beat Huff.
almost got the all same color
we have 3 american cheeses and a cheddar
all that and no level either
mushrooms growing in your ceiling, sir
its not harrys problem, its the dojos problem now
@SwiftPichu_ what do you think cooked koopa tastes like?
Well at least you don't have audio
You know what I'm eating Mario's ass
Thank you so much for to a eating my ass
This chapter sucks when it's scaled high
I noticed you get relatively angry when it comes to pape
What do you need for go mode? Just watt?
Well so... the anger is usually in ruins
get out of this hell hole

Fuck you ads KEKW in the worst time possible
That was really fucking close lol
Going into JR rigby had a 50 sec lead but you passed him during the jr fight
Your castle saved you so much time
that jr fight won you this match
He was going into castle but your jr and hallway got you a nasty lead back
he was touching ch4 card when u was fighting the boss
Rigby got Watt has you were going to fight lantern
Best of 3 or just the one?
We'll see how much I spend at MoA tomorrow before I gift subs lol
oh we just need 1 more then
hows it feel you dont have to race again LUL

Dude...we app get to play mario kart?!?!
Cheer100 shadow: hey, there, young lady. you know well the ways of the warrior i see

Just have a friendcode in your sub channel

Thanks for the sub jay monadoLove
Imma eat everyone's ass as congrats
No ass eating for me Pichu...I haven't showered today

I pressed a button by accident on discord xD
Okay gtg... phanto274GG Phan and have fun drinking man

Hey! Where's my bike? Has anyone seen where it is?
Sorry I couldn't play today...I hurt my tootsies and been in pain
400k points gone just like that
you could've redeemed 400 random shadow lines
Ran into our stair rail chasing our car
I was at the dentist anyways
can you do that for free
are you cheating the system with free big emotes
According the computer history museum they have a "retro gaming" exhibit with a playstation 2 and final fantasy 10 and grand theft auto san andreas on display. Excuse me, but im sorry. If San Andreas is a retro game then why am I not getting social security benefits? Cheer100
Did you see splatoon worlds winners lose all their benefits of winning bc they said like every slur
Oh no! This zone is zenless!
@RavenFP what benefits did they have?
@Axl_SR Trophies irl and then they had ingame banners and stuff immortalizing them
I looked into it when it first came out they did say like EVERYTHING
They were thorough with their hatred I gotta respect it
convinced every NA Splatoon player is either racist, gay, or splash
Am I required to be mobile
I mean there is just a pc version
I wanna use my pad >:(
Speaking of PC I am strongly considering genshin again. I feel like I will just update it again and just not play it though
The qr code is too small I can't scan it
yeah i know... but i kinda want to ruin my life...
just be like me i play 4 gacha games OOOO
I play my 1 and sometimes 2 if I get in an arknights mood
i didn't know u can say fuck in a rated t game until i played this
@RavenFP speaking of I completely forgot to mention that there's an arknights mod for Rivals
think along as it beep i think its fine
i got grace the other day i was like nice big booba
I really wanted to try this
@SeventyFourTG Eh that's just the protag idc ab her
hoooouuggghhh short haired girl my beloved
he looks cool but damn. annoying
it is downloading resources on my phone I will pop up on the thingy at somepoint
thought we'd be completely stuck with billy
wish this game would give me more copies of anby Madge
Yea honkai 3rd really is the only one of these to give you the same char with diff movesets and let you build teams of a char lol
3rd is so story driven they just add new battlesuits of the chars for more movesets a lot instead of cluttering the story
isn't impact 3rd on like 7.3 or some shit
I mean the current wave of updates is called 2.0 cause it's the first core overhaul
But yea it's been a long time
They finally finished the whole first arc
Now it's a new group of chars
I am not caught up on part 2
Part 1 was very good though kiana and mei are banger protags
when you get to account level 30 plus its not just mash anymore
i have too actually set up my buffs now
I still dont like how much it freezes when you chain tags and shit in this one
3rd feels snappier and I got more moves and shit
i just wish its wasn't a force switch sometimes yeah i know you can just wait for the bar to empty
not being able to swap backwards on mobile outside of chain attacks also sucks
well the thing is i set all my buffs up switch in to do a big damage ult and oh time to switch again Madge
i been playing on challenge mode its a joke still
3rd was easy to me and then I hit 80 and started doing the actual leaderboard modes and my ass got kicked lmao
APHO mode and elysian realm also start out swinging at you bc of how they scale
it's ok. as long as we have anby screentime
this looks like a mobile interface
surely you can link accounts tho
Can u get the white hair maid lady so I can thirst also
Idk her name I saw her on twitter art once
can confirm you must do everything on mobile someone i watch 1 of his viewer started on mobile and went to pc and nothing counted
if loving anby makes me thirsty then i haven't had water for 3 days and am nearing death
Trying to go through my bookmarks to find wha tI'm thinking of and it's all arknights
can u get lucy or piper so i can thirst too
damn you guys loved that one
ummm uhhh like and subscribe for more bangers i guess
anyway hope you all are well tippiShy
alright we gotta do something about that outfit anby
@Starry_Arie you mean its not human enough in the sense that its such a tight fit?
ah yes. a normal flash drive
genuinely could be ear rings, if its small enough - just that it more then likely isnt that small
(yes I am currently riding the hyper factual train in my head, sorry)
let me know when it's safe to look again
@Starry_Arie I mean - depends on what you consider safe
sorry phantom if i'm being too much just lmk
what I will give the devs of this? they got lots of artistic creativity goin to go into detail as much as they do in the ways they do
Anyone gonna would the bear? Waiting
damn i never see chat this horny
Too many of them are too baby
also the blue girl is free later too
@Starry_Arie I am not horny >.> genuinely just saying its creative fluids which went into this. I never said that I would need that (and given I am playing shit like pikmin over and over and over and avoid games with "realistic" body movements for humanoid models.....
i have the dog guy cat girl grace and Ellen for my 5 stars this game love me for some reason
I am not horny >.> genuinely just saying its creative fluids which went into this. I never said that I would need that (and given I am playing shit like pikmin over and over and over and avoid games with "realistic" body movements for humanoid models.....
sorry i don't mean any harm actually i just thought it was funny
figured ya didnt mean harm, just wanted to make clear that I am tryin to be neutral / causal. cus be it horny jail or not, someone has to sit down and design this shit, animate it and everything.
and it looks polished in that regard
i wasn't actually responding to you at all with my earlier comment, it's ok lol you're good
they know what they're doin with these character designs
i know but fuuuuuck i hate mobile games
and you can use it on ps5 also
i might have to hop on zzzero........
i only have pc i do not care for consoles
well - gonna guess you could then do the initial link stuff on phone
tartt is hanging on by a thread right now
i was told it doesn't work i mean i could try it
so curiosity: aside of the dialog related, what is this game? aside of it being a gacha
sorry had to come back on my phone to click the link
is there a time limit on getting you money
just need to know if i'm speedrunning this shit or if i can just try it later
if i get lucy or piper i'll prob keep playing
@blacktiger51 well apparently your leg's beeing pulled by pulls not being pulled now 🙃
ok i know nothing about this game but anby is best girl
care to explain for the council?
I think there's some coercion going on
at least she doesnt have a basic ass name like "Nicole"
nicole is a mid name i agree
but also i don't really care about nicole to begin with
wait this is a mobile game?
you can play it on mobile
You got games on your phone? Stare
it would probably run fine for me
got the 12 and not the lower end model
fuck that might be a deal breaker
k time to lurk more, got SM64 achievements to clean up on
i do not need this much power in a phone
is that the one with the retractable camera?
there is arcade games that are coop but i think only 1 right now and its zzz
i have literally never heard of this phone before
i got a damn sony dslr camera in my phone
but yeah similar specs to flagship samsung at half the price roughly is always good
i still need to beat the story for this
@dreaded_ i will be getting a new phone soon and will consider this
tfw my phone doesn't have enough space for the full game
my game is still at 80%
i have like 4gb of space on my phone
I have 2 other gachas installed my phone is barely living this lol
best part is i have nothing on my phone KEKW
you play belle here if wise is mc
@Starry_Arie yeah this thing has plenty of space
not me battling my phone storage rn
how much space does this thing need???
iOS: You need around 26GB of space.
that's over a third of my storage
and another third is taken by system data/operating system
it won't even let me play the trial ;__;
this girl is literally just the girl from jak and daxter
i guess corin is cool too
i was gonna ask is this hoyoverse
yeah lmao i kinda figured it was
its just like the practice room at gdq
this performs like shit on my phone but also my phone is a piece of shit
i thought she said "thats my starbucks" and it felt very in character for a nicole
My phone is only ab 2 years old and mine is chugging lol
i like that you can download the game and continue with your twitch account, but cant create a game account with your twitch account
Also I'm in the intro now and it didnt pop up a thingy for you yet
my phone is heating up OMEGALUL i'm scared
wise? that wasnt an invitation i dont think lol
ok so i am literally not allowed to continue, i must download the game on my pc and play it there instead
hey you werent a creep right? "no but i wouldve been if i had thought to"
you do have 2 10 pulls on the other banner
They replaced our system with chatGPT dammit
I DONT UNDERSTAND REAL GIRLS LMAO
asking chatGPT why I can't understand women
they put their main demographic in the game lets go
Was considering playing this but I'll pass if the male player option is a dude that gets dating advice from google AI generated search results
is food included is such a mood
She can show me what those legs do
so bunny girls are just out here huh
actually i have no idea where this is supposed to be set but it does look a lot like japan
oh crap you can take pictures of your waifus
thats just the cat from little kitty big city
my phone is getting warm just downloading resources
Arknights still has superior animal ppl tho
i hope you have not been keeping up with my posts.
as long as i am here, anby will be appreciated
goodthere are better things to do
@dreaded_ ur so real for that. thank you for your service
wait that snake game goes hard
i thought you wanted the longest snake
godfinger has got nothing on Brookfield Illinois' Galloping Ghost Arcade
the longest snake? nah, i'd win.
tartt's one remaining braincell be buzzing "anby anby anby anby"
there a free 10 pull here
yeah you have 2 10 pulls now
show it to the webcam we'll watch together
next 10 pulls is a 5 star
you get a 5 star 1st time after 50 pulls here
how many combat maids are in this game?
next 5 star is after 80
or you can get early if you lucky
i have her at c6 she in my op ice team
remove anby and tart and I leave
tartt will never be the same
what is wrong with me man i don't obsess over characters like this
sometimes something just awakens in you y'feel
i wouldn't put it that way tbh
Coney used to do it but with like 50cent-2 dollar steam games for grabbag nights lol
He owns like 3 thousand steam games
Stop emerging from my monitor also hi chucky
why is pipers picture like that
ellen is fun to playa s
Calling Immersive Storytelling a gameplay feature is some AAA game talk if you ask me
can he... can he put his arms down?
It's like some fusion between Light and Wily
he's on a fucking stool ICANT
the year is 2XXX, bears have entered the political sphere
Now that I think about it have you ever streamed an anime game before?
why do dweebs like these always get lucky and have catgirls fly in through the window
was she watching through the window?
Wise: I can't stand women and their shopping center sales
had fun in the recording studio
and apparently in the artist's studio too
they always cut at the good part
wait anby not a cat person?
she sounds like she just learned to talk yesterday
gl i think i don't know what kind of game this is but i have gotten an absurd amount of ads for it
oh god excuse me i need to puke
@mx_four if you read the pinned message it'll tell you all you need to know about this game
which one is amby is it tummy or booby
this girl is named Nicole, boring aass
i've been here 5 minutes and i'm already immortalized in a quotebot
billy isnt a girl, but he sure is here
he reminds me of dmc lol
the combat is actually pretty cool
yeah that didnt look unfun at all
but the intro cutscene took so long to mash through
the story is not interesting enough for them to force me to read all that shit
all i've seen of this game before is that girl with the lollipops interrupting my music on youtube
but for real this game is great end game
but that misses out on prime anby time
the comic strip one when i launched the game made me skip each panel individually
Nicole looks like she hasnt had her starbucks yet
its so fitting that they can't see who you are since their helmets are opaque
bruh why was that person assuming the position for that assist
Anby just quoted spongebob lets go
"thats my wallet" so true anby
should replace billy with another waifu
actually all animal people in zzz is call that
did she just do a snake up tilt?
she the 2nd best dps in the game right now
relic, heirloom, same thing. calm down nekomata
to me nekomata just refers to the SMT demon so this is a little jarring
it would be way funnier if she just meowed like a cat instead of saying the word meow
nicole come on, your services are more expensive than that
i want a mod of this game that just replaces her dialogue with actual cat noises
nekomata looks like she's winding up for a ttyd spring shot in that panel
why does he always want to call the cops
maybe he wants to record them in secret
can you imagine how hard it would be to balance like that?
Yea her ears are huge :)
i thought about making that joke, arie LMAO
glad someone's here to voice my intrusive thoughts
go hang out with the cops you fuckin narc
wise just wants to file noise complaints on everyone
wait if billy is a robot he could have any voice they wanted
his creator has a sick sense of humor
could pick from any voice in the universe and he picked the whiny teenage boy one
if billy is a robot he couldve just not been created, his creator has a sick sense of humor
Requires us to. You are small
nice ad. "Hey, it's me, *your skin.*"
nekomata's japanese voice would improve my viewing and listening experience by a lot
bruh ion want my skin talking to me
damn that was supposed to be a specific user
oh no guess you gotta gift again
bezos just scammed the shit out of you
i mean uh yo phantom Kappa
@dreaded_ Thanks for the gift sub!
thank you twitch auto fill for helping me write words
phanto274ColonD surely bezos will understand the mistake and give me my $6 back
we need 9 more subs now
dont matter. even at mach 2 you wouldn't make it
sorry metal gear rising poisoned my brain
oh HELL yeah this emote rocks phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
i love how the characters move in this game tbh
yeah the visual presentation is pretty cool
Cheer100 shadow: Chat, donate $5800 to Phantom right now, and your favorite Zenless Zone Zero girl will visit you in your dreams to reject you
Miss Corin, we'll let you come
dang that tts was rough lol
Wise shut up you weirdo. mr "i wouldve recorded you if i knew youd be so carefree"
yo this  chick got a buzz saw
yeah she was my 2nd 5 star in this game
I don't like gacha games much on principle but this does look kinda fun
yeah i definitely wont put any real money into this game if i start actually playing haha
this the only gacha where i am f2p in
open world gacha is a thing?
last one i played was fire emblem heroes lol
yooo m4 i played fire emblem heroes for a very long time
I had to quit Fire Emblem Heroes because powercreep was getting bad
yeah i haven't played it since i worked at the liquor store lmao
but i enjoyed it a lot
bezos was scoping out the station
it looks like nichijou thats sick
1 thing about hoyo is the powercreep doesn't get too bad in genshin i can still clear everything with old characters
Haha this pinned message is so accurate
Do you like the game thus far ?
no one is laughing at anby though phanto274Smile
wait the nekomata being basically a liquid joke is kinda fire
The game is nice to you, it gives you the impression you have huge skill by just mashing the whole controller
i do really like the comic book style cutscenes
yeah i am digging the style
yeah cutscenes makes the game even funnier
yeah bugs don't take not getting action very well
id be down for a bedroom like this
when else do you doomscroll reddit
I'm the only person in this world picking Wise as main protagonist or what KEKWait
if i drank coffee before i gamed i'd have to take a break 20 minutes in to hit the bathroom
yo is that my homie calm guy
let's submit the idea to devs Okayge
vr fight stuff is very handy
this is like resin from genshin
This game is I think a gacha game
Yeah I can smell Gachas from whatever distance away
I play FEH and soon Magia Exedra
I'm looking forward to the continuation of Madoka Magica while waiting for the next movie
She's not only a maid, but a freakin lumberjill
yeah i wouldn't waste stuff on billy KEKW
She's everywhere and still not managing to take a single selfie
it was a single on stable banner
yeah you get tons early game
on stable i done 130 pulls just buy the free master tapes
oh go to the shop 5 free pulls you can buy
yeah and still by far enough ressources if you play regularly
Just to warn anyone that if you play a Gacha game expect major grind
Don't expect a lot of meaningful content like hard trials
oh i just noticed the pinned message
i'm not sure i'd even recognize her
You think you'll stream more of this?
Yeah unless the gacha game has co-op, they're much better single player experiences
Like the only thing exciting about Gacha games is the pulls
pretty sure its 180 character pulls if you do everything
since i have pull way more then 180 if you count both banners
i have water fruit punch and milk for drinks and there like 3 cans of pop
I'm gonna say it. This stream got a lot less exciting when all the Zenless Zone Zero women went away
Maybe I can steal rains phone lolz
So was Danger Mario Black Pit but look what happened
Are there  chests in the randos that are always useless?
Alrighty...I would come by a bunch of rupees constantly and wondered that
That's cool but very dangerous lolz
KEKW Pow Quake on the Toad
phanto274GL on rest of pape man... it's nearly bedtime. And highly deserved phanto274GG evo17Hiyo
i swear every time i go do something  a bot show up KEKW
i was away for like 4 mins
This is in fact, not fine
What floor do you need to get to to unlock monadoBooba Mario skin?
I was lurking earlier before work was done and chuckling at the horniness lol
Oh right cause hurricane is busted in this
you too can have a big rack on your phone !zzz
is this the pit of 100 trial
there also random in the pit
so you could get 4 p up d down
Not to mention Flower Finer on Floor 30
how many power rush is in base game
it been a while since I played the original game
Cloud Nine doing it's best close call impression
SMB3's story is about Mario trying to get his medicine back from Bowser
My only complaint is that it uses the generic Underground Music. I'd love an N64 remix of TTYD's Pit, especially with Remake
I'm kidding. I'm not going to do it
You're having an early Kooper WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
Man i've been getting a lot of mileage out of that emote tonight
I have, Coke Zero to be specific
I'm going shopping tomorrow midday but I'm not expecting good weather either
Hey. Hey. Hey Phantom. Hey. Hey Phantom. Did u kno that in World Famous RPG Paper Mario, plants are weak to the sleep condition? This is because plants are sleepy. Hope this helps!
stream was good, hows black pit going
is there a command that explains what black pit is
its basically pit from ttyd in pape 64
Sweet jeebus that was 400 coins
Is that normal for a floor 2 chest
I really need to play black pit again this mod is sick
And this chat is what we call "Surviving by the skin of your teeth"
so SpoopyGhost 2CoolJonathan AuntSusan or BabySun
if only you could superguard, this whole thing would at least have a layer past "whoops this sucks me ded rip"
which ik superguards are not an ideal solution
not to mention I can only imagine if it were to be implemented into a pape64 mod, it'd be super rough around the edges
Sounds like a skill issue to me Phantom
yeah that def plus would of been nice
have played enough isaac "Oh hey no keys on a floor with 7 keys I could spend" or similar cases with bombs
is it often that this spits out such dry streaks?
and no updates to this at any point to address this I reckon?
understandable in a way, but sad
I thought you were doing one more
ok let me go complete that redeem Kappa
group focus could not help in any way either I reckon?
as a start I mean for more star storms
damn twice in a row KEKHeim
so its a superstar rather, got it
yo Phantom can i ask what you use for the random voice line redeem?
oh you can set it on shuffle?
ok thank you I was just thinkin about how i would implement an idea i had
Personally I think the problem is Fire Shield. That use doesn't kick in until like what, floor 35?
ok think its Bedge time now
it does look rather spelunky in that sense yea
granted, I have never played spelunky
but by what I have seen of it, it does very much look similar to thatt
until spelunky spawns events like boulders in such a way that it WILL trigger the shops so you are locked out of them and have the shopkeepers rush through the rooms
this does feel like it shoulda kept the focus intact atop of the stylishes to me for one
then from say risk of rain where you also have those "spend coins / keys / health for chances of upgrades", a weighting system in a way
ROR doesn't have any kind of weighting, other than rarity of items
@janitorbeav afaik, you can have slightly better odds on the chests against health to get you stuff - also the % of health you have to offer is lower on the early floors then it is on the later ones last I recall
if you're referring to HP->Money shrines, it always goes 50%->75%->98%. I'm not sure what the HP chests you're talking about are. In RoR2, there are void caches that always cost 50% HP for a void item.
yea I am not on RoR2, but 1 - and I could have sworn it had a bit of a weight to not drain you as muc - though that could also have been infused by me last havin played with getting the 45leaf clover so much that I would just explode my builds into ultimate regen
which in ROR1 you could set up and shit
so this has now turned into a spook festival? PrideLaugh
or are there enemies able to block spook
aka rly this is just a super dry one until you got your partners at which point half the shit you see isjust doable for free => you just become invincible by means of that
as in "how this particular thought of rouge like works"
yes you have said that earlier, my brain's just connectin it now (and I bet I did so last time you did lots of this, just brain go derp)
is there at least a good reason behind minmaxing star power gains or also no?
once you got that setup with which you can just steamroll the floor fights I mean
oh hey look peekaboo, the most useful of all potential items
kinda surprised that thing's even allowed to drop
just make it be toggle-able options before a run start
cant be that hard I reckon
without spook, 20 floors ago woulda been over
already been ohheyi30Lurk but gl again
god I love the smack ability
I need to play pape again
spook is such a dumb ability
truly I blame spook for making pape a dead game
I was eating so good until spook became a thing everyone wanted to do
@Serendipity29 I dont think they WANT to do it
It just has to be done
why do we have to go like THAT fast though
can't we go just kinda fast
That's what rando is for kazamsCatglubhappy
that's true, rando is my cozy content
I'm tired of what I have to do in wwhd runs so I only play rando lol
38% chance to finish at the very end of the run kazamsCatglubdoom
@RavenFP gonna guess thats barrier skip related?
barrier skip you just tilt the shield to the left a frame and it gets you in
tells ya how much I watched ww or wwhd runs
SD barrier skip is a huge thing cause that trick in that game is stupid lol
cus to me, most of the silly shit you can do in windwaker is black magic which I dont wanna interact with PrideLaugh
like a 20s angle setup and then you have a frame perfect bomb drop
I would never ever in my life run ww, but they are such fun runs to watch
Probably the zelda game I like watching most
I should really stream it again I did a bunch of rando for like 3 weeks and then stopped wanting to click live LOL
like - I respect anyone able to do runs of those games, but the amount of silly shit which storage / superswim related stuff lets you do => my brain's just kinda off
sometimes you just need a break from the live button
sure, its cool, but if its like half of what happens give / take, I am kinda out
I use that break to enter tournaments and stress harder kazamsCatglubhappy
@Jonxhas this is how i feel about speedrunning in general
I love watching it but like
I ain't talented enough to do it
Tho I been thinking about maybe doing a couple of glitchless runs for fun
Windwaker HD at least the difficulty is a bit exaggerated, swims are way simpler in it esp in nomss categories cause you get a map
You can get away with excluding a lot and get decent times
@Serendipity29 for me its also kinda w rando for ww - 100% respect anyone capable of doing all the glitches and shit, but man a glitchless ruleset with glitch logic use for glitched races on rando sounds so yum to me
and hell, if helmaroc king is such a pain in the neck, just exclude that particular boss from ever rolling required
but let FF turn into an island for it
HD rando removes rng on helmarock it's sick
rando related change I bet that is then?
SD you just do storage and bully him in the basement but that doesnt work in HD
yea honestly - that alone fixes a lot of why (from what I heard) WWR has had such a high "oh lets just keep storage and related allowed, fuck it"
HD they patched it in, races idk if they're gonna use it
other bits obviously being wind / earth temple, but those if required also kinda such if you mess 1 step of the shit you wanna do up
Item sliding is so strong storage is pretty weak in comparison speed wise
yea no clue - all I know is WWR is interesting on paper for me, but I just dont wish for me to have to learn glitches so I instead stuck with playing it glitchless / personal rules, meaning I wont do any super swims or storage, but given say, hammer through walls just kinda can happen, I end up doing (only rly matters in cabana cave anyway)
Oh hey, Peekaboo is out of the pool
I dont like rando races in general so yea just play how you enjoy it
as said though: respect to anyone capable of doing all that nonsense you can do in ww be it SD or HD
I will never enter hd league races cause I dont care for it I will just play on my own
@RavenFP I do respect if say, glitchless with respective "what can do / cant do" if that makes sense
After playing FG's long enough all the shit I do in WW feels tame lol
that being said, I wouldnt ever join any races cus rando for me is HUGE on puzzle solving
I've won everything for king of fighters in my region for the past year tho
So my hand trauma is worth it lol
mario likes it when he gets slapped
similar in that sense btw to twilight princess - if there were some huge like back in time shenanigans or whathaveya which I would have to look into for rando, I'd just stick to easy shit.
another game which in rando huge fun, but if I were in the forced need to break the game in half sideways just to beat it, I'd be out PrideLaugh
alright I gotta go lay down cuz early start tomorrow
of course the one in the middle wouldnt
i wish you minimal having to spook for the rest of the run
goodnight and holy shit that lady's rack

phanto274Lurk i mean yeah looks like pape
Cheer100 shadow: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. You can't get Anby, Billy, Nicole, and 180 free pulls unlike in Zenless Zone Zero. Download now for free

This is just a final fantasy crystal
Ah yes, shell power... My favorite element
Why would they do such a thing?
Are you on gold pace? phanto274Gold
Now all we need is Yellow Koopa
Today I had a home insurance guy take pics of my house. The convo shifted to video games so i invited him to show how I play Twilight Princess Rando on original hardware. He nevver seen anything like that and thought it was the coolest thing ever
where are we on goals? Think you said youre doing ique this week?
mario kart would be great before I cancel switch online in a few weeks LUL
getting cozy here to be entertained during work phanto274BLANKIES
How many gift subs for you to do Mario Party Mini-Game Island speedrun right now KEKW
Is that the plushie I got you in the back
The cutest vtuber on twitch dot tv?

So punching a Yoshi baby huh
there's actually an old SMRPG remix album called "Heavy Troopa's Ready to Launch"
Sandstorm? WHo let Darude in here?
So dumping him down a pit like how Yoshis are usually tossed away?
yo why they hate my boy red
Well Link is sleeping in Bowser's keep so he should still be alive
Think the next summon should be Geno

i see red and yellow but who's the other guy
oh scarecrow is a status OMEGALUL
never accounted for logic to do that

hit 'em with the koopa whirl
Forcing you to buy trueform pins
YOOOO ITS THE KOOPA BROS! quizmoPog
Are you close to the end?
It's like a 5 vs 3 fight I see it perfectly reasonable Clueless
guessing koopers story has been rough?
Otherwise typical kill or be killed
And by fun I mean miserable
Red's glitching out to be Mario
wait that wasn't the final boss

The return of the dastardly cake
youre fighting a cake!? Now I know where color splash got its inspiration from.
btw The International Olympic Committee have unanimously voted yes for the creation of the Olympic Esports Games
anyhoo: I am doing. hoverless SMS120shine for retroachievements was surprisingly interesting despite the fact that taking gameplay away on paper sounds whack
like - I'd say about 10 out of all the collectibles were stupid, which eh
what I appreciate it for is because I already am interested into the move rando stuff Sunshine on paper has nozzle related through AP
meaning the "do shit weird" stuff does help there and shit
if / when SMS AP rando gets more stable that is
cus vanilla shine reqs barring corona access = eh
is this the forbidden pm64 chapter 9?
so Black is a summoner, Red is like a fighter of sorts, Yellow seems to be a white mage, and Kooper is like a black mage??
I’m finally here! I miss anything today?
is this "just" a respriting and done or is there more?
just was curious since I do get using whats existent, just that I am sittin there ben like "it rpg = it new shit or same shit but reorganized, done"
and yes, its not necessarily a level of "new" which one should expect from mods, but when one sees it every so often, curiosity :D
I have hit my new hardest kof11 combo and my hands hurts
"completely new game to low level til the mind breaks"
again: I cant ever say reusing whats there is bad
I do like how yesterday when ya played this, the area names I had picked up were like soda lake and shit
meaning there's someYoshi island to main land crossover tippiTap
man these boos seem VERY sturdy
tooo be fair: it does make sense with the boos to be high evasion at least - they're ghosts and all
no accuracy raising sounds rough ye
hey - at least this is not secret of mana weapon orb farm? PrideLaugh
which - yea... never get shadow zero'd
which on paper is easy cus you can just scan every chest
but its teeedious, and casually you'd not think to do that necessarily
--> your odds of maxing your weapons go to 0
I wonder if those miss / hit odds were messed with for this or not
cus man this shows some early RPG "fuck evasion" tropes
like - man I wish secret of mana melee combat would be worth anything - sadly its only worth if you are completely out of magic
well KEKW green better have the ultima weapon there? I dunno where the move gains stopped in vanilla and shit
Sarasaland shoulda been represented by a ball flower
curiosity: the colors of the chests wouldnt mean that the respective coopa of that color deals more damage to them?
like - that would be tooo indepth thoughts?
and ye you were right, 18 is max in vanilla for moves - mario gets ultra flame, mallow gets star rain, geno is 1 early with geno flash, bowser gets bowser crush and peach gets psych bomb
it definitely is a far out type of thought I bet, ye - I mean like - in the end it should be just numbers
yea nah I dont think, that my thought holds ground KEKW
i should play this game just for the music tbh
Who put Kooper on the squad
bro thinks he's on the team
These Boos have like 50% evasion or something
I wish someone had as good tongue game as bellome
I wanna give Yellow a hug and a crisp high five
What is this, looks cool POGGIES
there's definitely only one flower bush in the world
too many hammers with inefficient pathing
seems like a waste of money
wait a sec, those aren't goombas
look at all those flower bushes
why is it that I got the feeling these enemies are all super mad at mario for existing
come to think silly question: why do you need someone to stand on - dont the koopa bros have their stack spin attack? PrideLaugh
I don't wanna see a Toad in his underwear
the moment when you need normal ass items is when ttyd troubles take over PrideLaugh
imagine being me who at first never cared for the troubles until postgame -> having to specifically get the shit which ya dont care for at all
technically the troubles could have been intresting
but they've been severly held back by GC ttyd's no QoL in backtracking
with the Switch one that is solved to an extent - the other bit is the fact you just get 1 to do at a time which really isnt much
so you cant do them smart, you're needed to do 1 at a time
your team comp rn isnt organized right 🙃 dont you know its RGB and not RBG
only red is allowed to be greedy KEKW
missed opportunity for the golden koopa
last I renember, jump farm was useful right? tippiGiggle
so did the ones in Seret of mana PrideLaugh
well - except for that lil haha funny fact, that in secret of mana you just frame spam magic for chonkers
just gotta let the numbers go through every so often so that you dont overstack the 999 KEKW
what if it is related to the koopa outside of the library room?
What's the next fucked up fight?
That statement helps procreation of yoshis so kudos to that
FUCK YOU GAME I WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT KEKW
Where's Watt when you can use her
and bets only red is allowed to have it
I love (fucking hate) this game
@SwiftPichu_ did you do low levels and if so: WHY KEKW
you know game that would of been nice you know not at fucking end game
literally the biggest meme I hear about this game is doing low levels cus it just ALWAYS falls apart KEKW
But yes low% is gamble the game for like 12 hours
@blacktiger51 but at end game is when you either just beat it or power level
@SwiftPichu_ well - technically its not that long even. if you get the RNG to just always play in your favor
oh I aint doin that shit KEKW
At least remake looks more consistent for low level
you still have some RNG, but you can nail down the fight bonuses to a 50/50 rather then 33% ish
cus you can follow the one where the big bonus is visually
Oh BTW phantom, question from a friend, she's setting up parallel but is having issues binding C buttons, ever encountered that in Pape?
could the blue flower be inside of a house like in a vase?
uhhh fook - my best guess would be to nail down which input type you need
that its recognized correctly inside of the config and shit
then its pj style menus rly
so click button to bind, then press to confirm bind
Fuck if I know Jon KEKW I told her I used retroarch and pj64
cant speak for N64 controllers though KEKW
yea basically pichu: parallel launcher is PJ style config menus in front of RA
so you dont have the fucked up controller mapping initially or the autobind fuckin shit up sideways for ya
OK then I should be able to help, issue, our times getting together for her to share the screen lol
wish I could help more, but never had an N64 controller to connect to PC
big pro imo for Parallel Launcher is how EASY it is to switch core, graphics plugins and shit without having to open tons of menus
and your controller profiles being simple as fuck to a) save individually, b) load similar, c) set up as a whole
and on the inside, its RA in terms of what you would expect from that end
@SwiftPichu_ if you got RA rolling, I wont say switch KEKW
I changed to pj for ootmm
plus like - Ares has been talked about a fair bit
@SwiftPichu_ parallel Launcher / RA can work for that outside of Multiworlds 🙃
Huh, never seen a SMRPG re
looks more like they failed to cut the map properly
what it does indicate is that this room was messed with though..
maybe it's like a hidden thing inside a hidden place
where's the double tree area? And I don't mean the timeshare.
yeah was going to say "do you have the correct patch?!"
This thing turned into Pokémon very quick, next time you're gonna tell me the red learns fire moves, the blue water moves and the yellow electric moves
Which koopa is which character lol
red is all-rounder, green is physical bulk, yellow is support caster, black is offensive caster. Kooper is...Kooper?
I also thought this hack was gonna be much shorter lol
Still needs another LB but otherwise good
Does Yoshi Cola taste like Yoshis, or come from Yoshis?
I'm concerned about where is cola comes from though
I mean - Kackletta and others did do that in a way
speaking of Yoshi, did you see the new lego Mario set? It's SNES Mario riding Yoshi! The legs move and the tongue comes out too
so that’s how they’ve been traveling to the Underwhere with having their crystals stolen lol
I could go for a lil green boost, if you know what I'm sayin
does that include magic atk and def
ok that’s what I thought too
what if green boost was so late purely so you could have this
wait, but how do you KNOW if you're the original
they didnt let you get geno boost early
cus otherwise that woulda been a recipe for low level
but what if green boost and the item which essentially is that stack
imagine being in a fight and just whipping your shirt at the person
I hope he falls off the castle
monkaW think YouTube know of my ad blocker
I was about to type out "hey lets wait for kolorado to run into a pit of lava again
I mean - they got health
so you're not too strong yet tippiAFirret
you'd think those enemies would be immune to the shell element
wait what? Is shell an actual element? I was just making that up lol
someone's still subbed to me on Twitch and I haven't streamed in about a year O_O
I was thinking about streaming NWC:NES though
yeah, I just got my paycheck from Twitch
thought he was about to Pick Me Up

@janitorbeav Thanks for the gift sub!
watch this be the only boss susceptible to poison
you know you gotta save for phase 2

@buff00n no clue what it is

@jonxhas Burgers, Hot Dogs, Italian Beefs, that kinda joint
the chaos emeralds are rampaging ooooh noooo
where's knucks with the master emerald?!
of course final bosses always have a phase 2
Does it have the same weaknesses
It doesn't, only Group Hug does for some reason
how is shadoo queen still standing
so.... we just leave that fire there?
oh i just realize those are the koopa bros from pape KEKW
i was thinking this was gonna be like 6 hours KEKW

n64 chip got shrunk enough to be put inside a controller
Wii U looks different than I remember
howd you get pape on here? and what did you do about the power adaptor?
Is that chinese smash brothers 64?
today I learned that "Horny Goat Weed" tea is a thing
Bro bought all the good titles except banjo tooie
You can't do multiplayer at all on this thing? Why would they release an N64 one then? cringe
where does the expansion pak go?
I assume it already has expansion pak amounts of RAM built in.
if they made that shit in 1997, I'd be VERY impressed
were you able to use a converter?
so its not a ique branded power adaptor
and how did you obtain this?
there are youtube videos if you really wanna see thatt stuff anyways
It's a shame that Nintendo never reused / remix Yoshi's Island's Underground theme
you're now a part of the YouTube upload
hey i have a sticker of that split bg
after thee run I wanna see how long it takes you to do BHS LUL
does the controller/console get hot during use?

how do you get games on iQue
i thought you were gonna say 240 ganes
couuldnt they emulate that on a modern PC?
cheap china knock off d pad Kappa
how big is it the ique
I was gonna guess dreamcast controller
cant wiat to see retrigger prologue
evo17Hiyo sup everyone. few secs behind so imma just lurkies
how many total subs for crystal legacy?
heck 酷栗欧 all my homies hate 酷栗欧
just so you know boston brew has also done a run on ique
i looked up goombario's chinese name lmao
the real question... can brian say goombarios chinese name?
why don't you try and find out
copypasted from the mario wiki lmao
you know that... and I know that... but Mirby doesnt know that
very nice name for him KEKW
Good luck with the IQue test
we should use this build for rando
faster? so this is the optimal version of pape to run. Got it!
im so ready for 7th try speedy
How does it feel, guessing like shit?
goombario start time to reroll the seed
酷栗欧 start time to reroll the seed*
shy guys will be a fun teest
We’re playing a Switch game now, simplified Chinese is the fastest language
Obviously not relevant to this category, but was this version based on PAL, JP, US or entirely different?
when was last time you ran glitchless?
Imagine if they based it off of PAL LUL
You can also tell from the partner get music, lol
Partner music is a completely different song, Bowser music just has different instrumentation (US has an electric guitar melody, JP has a synth)
partner music always stands out to me after listening to it so much as a kid
The JP partner song is pretty much 1 to 1 the song ‘America’ from West Side Story, which is probably why they changed it LUL
Lopez you got a new glitchless record to chase down now
yo Amish ty for the gl
the module is interchangable with N64 afaik
yo Lopez ty for the gl
I should've bundled a steel bowl with my Wii U at GDQ
why do play on the iQue just wanna try it or somthings els
haro, can I borrow that ique pls
actually how much did it cost??
@buff00n i ahve no ieda what cuz paim means
@blacktiger51  pain tru i know that feeling
So when’s the iQue input display gonna be ready? Kappa
so small update, I likely need to wait 5 weeks to get to a neurologist to check me KEKW why does the healthcare system suck so hard here. not as bad as the US but still
5 weeks of vertigo, here we come peepoClap
didn't think a Healthcare system could rival the US's
at least I don't to earn a ton of money to get healthcare
@Rag3torock you tag the wrong person KEKW
@blacktiger51 @buff00n  you see i am suck at it to
what made you want to run on ique lol
@sandyX nobody have run it in the comjunity
I remember bostonbrew has a loong time ago lol
i know how to say hi that about it
What differences does the iQue version have?
bing chilling means ice cream Haha2020
I can semi read traditional chinese to get the gist of something but not simplified
I had a week off and I burned myself out programming
if you came back you'd smash it even with those happening lol
I had to compile the objective c runtime for windows with mingw and make my own base library to replace foundation so I could make my game portable
I don’t even know what kind of game I want to make so I’m just going to take all the things I like about other games lol
paper mario with a physics engine and guns
I imagine it was weird af
for a second there i was like wait what game is this
i forgot about the in-between chapter parts LOL
Casually turn off the game by accident
You got any mods in your Discord server?
Thanks, sorry just wanna keep your community safe from discord hackers and scammers
In Ocarina text was about.. 5% faster over JP and double that for English. So the way text boxes work for this game, you might be saving a couple frames or so per text box
If you really wanna test it, I'd time intro text that Luigi reads off
lmao this game was re-release for iQue in 2004 while JP & America got the sequel KEKW
True, Master Quest Debug is what's on there
But it only plays normal OOT
it’s okay, you’ll only lose 3 hours when it happens
Have you ever soddered anything or did hardware modifications before?
thats why i got permanent eyeliner
Gotcha, was gonna recommend just soddering a normal controller to the board.
Lurking turned into sleeping machine lolz
As anyone's messages been failing to send on Twitch lately? I keep getting that error every now and then
Aww song grubba cry makes me sad
Yea I just get "Your message failed to send." every now and then, and it's annoying KEKW
Did you beat the kooper hack?
It seemed tough from what I watched
I'm going to bed, don't despair over the stick phanto274GL
you're just that happy to see me Kappa
now I'm gone for real though, byeee
*Pape runners scramble to find an iQue*
I thought it was an ! Im bad at twitch
do we know if this is based on the English or JP version in terms of version differences
like if item dupes work or raph skip
so just good for glitchless i guess
don’t mind my boomer brain LUL
that’s pretty unfortunate tho, i guess all cards would benefit too aside from kooper puzzle skip
How much time we saving on the iQue?
lots of red style time save
*Mario talking to Junior* “I’m gonna beat the shit out of these eggs•
some day the eggs will learn the truth
My guy is about to be made an undercooked cake
make me into an undercooked cake uwu
wonder what will happened if you put a rando on the ique
i know you can put your own games on this
so you have to put the rando rom on this i wonder if it play
i was playing Mario Galaxy today haha
i don't think i've ever seen or heard of the iQue before
oh god, i saw the tweet you made haha
that looks like a Dreamcast controller
Damn you got me Rubix I’m on mobile KEKW
What are the big differences in the iQue vs the original?
Ok gotcha. Is it a separate speedrun category? Or are you just tracking it separately?
1st one the board is still 1st
I had to look it up, not gonna lie.
I know so much trivia about games I've never played on consoles I don't own :)
Oh, there's nothing I love more than hyperfixating on a game I'm never gonna play and learn all the little ins and out
Lorewise, why did we have to break machine before planting vine?
Nobody wants to work anymore Kappa
Is grip or button placement going to be more of a pain?
I was being quiet, but then my intrusive thoughts won when it came to the sushi + wife = Wushi
Luck is a skill issue 4Head
I just woke up...Phan you look like you're about to pass out
I'm sorry what? 10 hrs?? That's lucky as hell
I mean...waste of time out of days sure but I'm pretty sure helps with brain
Me and rain got these insulated curtains from Walmart... they're really good when it comes to blocking sun
You could. Question is... would you lolz
They're like 14.98 here but idk if price will be different where you are
I mean when you think about it...it is necessary
Heres a well deserved, preemptive phanto274GG
I gotta agree with Adam though... the outlines do look thicker
Probably why I thought bowser looked bigger... even his face lolz
It really is an IQue test now
Hey I just got here can you do it again I missed it
Need to see the ending credits before we can call it GG
The G is not G until the credits roll
We'll see you again Bow in TTYD
It's not like this will cause a third Paper Mario game
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez thanks for the gl
Yo phantom congrats on the wr
looks the same size as my joy con Kappa
How much was the iQue btw?
What a horrendous place for the power button
now to save these splits and never open them back up again LUL
chinese is only kanji, while japanese has kanji and kana
What is even the etc lolz
Now why is that filename like that phantom
dont you have a warp pipe at castle grounds?
Rando only and a laterish addition
Did we have that at the beginning of blitz?
Heartthrob cat is along for pets again lol
did he split at epilogue or at mario house?
I got a new house! Yahoo!
Is green boost essentially just Geno boost?
The fuck is this guy doing here
I looked away...was the king defeated?
3looks pretty much in the middle Kappa
Axl get your butt in here lolz
Yooo...won't be able to watch this fight lolz
She said, "Fuck green, in particular"
Can we get 2 Shredders in one turn?
This brain has a lot of juice
Okay good I don’t feel bad now
I didnt know what it was from then that effect told me earthbound lol
Also that's the battle sprite for Ness' Nightmare technically
Kind of a bad omen that you see multiple times before fighting it near the end of the game
Ah yes google tells me Earthbound
As does chat if I had been reading lmao
So how's this hack compared to vanilla?
Link not doing his job smh
I don’t know how you outheal that
oh that’s a cool Easter egg
@SplashV_ I hope ur rolls are shit
They probably will my gacha luck is quite shit
and there's still a side wall and the back wall to fill up
god that's a lot of gigs
for a phone game, it is
last I rememeber like 21 ish
idk what this is but it looks cool
is this like kooper leads the koopa bros on a mario rpg quest?
ahh ok. I love the concept LUL
the facts that’s splash super jump is nuts
@janitorbeav thanks for the gift sub!
That seemed to be a slightly misleading roulette animation
Oh my god 1 hour fight incoming
so how was the iQue pape?
bruh, 5 hours is long for me, cause that's what i did of sm64 oot
Phantom5800 is now live! Streaming The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess: Weekly Community Rando Race | !socials #Ad !ZZZ
(Having a couple freezes back here
Imma drop to 720p High Latency see if that lets it behave
i am Madge today should be doing the rest of the d2 shit i need to do but i heard nothing from friends today
Mate, I ran the Metroid Prime 2 Weeklies, don't talk to me about tech issues (especially early days)
Season 2 used Full Gear Shuffle and Blitz, yeah?
Remind me again, how much money do you need to purchase everything major in these settings
Good luck with the race, Phantom!!
Aye, I know Wind Waker Tourney rules barely spend any money
Well with Beetle's prices in this economy I'm not surprised
Now you just need a sub rod
It's annoying...I do it during the flight by fowl prices
Question because this happened to me once
You ever hit the poe and they fall, about to jump for soul, and poe disappears because of morning
Sheesh, even in TP Hyrule you can't escape it
Give 500$ to receive 100$ lolz
How often is it the same item is hinted twice
hey bub. yes it was good
hoping to gift him a sub sometime but
i'm off to a baseball game. have a fun stream :D
Oh yeaaaah, that's right, it's an Always hint at that spot. Makes sense
Goddammit I feel like I'm gonna fall asleep...bad sleep schedule
@AnniLyn2 I know right? I was out until 3 PM today
I think we're not supposed to give hints or suggestions
Let me put it to you this way. My work hours are 4 AM to 1 PM
Say what now? I already forgot what you said xD
Jesus crimmity Christmas captain. Those some large seas you're sailing
That was... reference to work time sorry... thought it was funny for a second
Well TV never sleeps. Someone's gotta do it. Honestly the hours aren't the problem for me, it's the commute (90 Minutes round trip)
What do you do? I'm lost on what it is lolz
The words were small so I had to squint lolz
Well I'm gonna be busy the next few weeks. We have Metroid Prime 2 Rando starting Monday. Our settings change each week like a league and they're pretty spice
Barren category can only be a starting hint now
Do you have like...a bunch of streamers open to watch for cheating?
If I see it, but I'm not super looking for it
Did you guys by any chance fix the bridge jump? I can't seem to do it anymore
Wtf...I kept climbing and then falling off
Sorry for rambles. Trying to stay awake
For Echoes, We start normal, then shuffle the elevators, then All Bosses, then No Hints, then players pick starting items (and random start area), then a sort of blitz setting.
Runners can also agree to fine tune some things like adding multiplayer pickups (Double Damage etc.) or use a new patcher that randomizes some puzzles
@AnniLyn2 I had to step away, what happened?
He found lantern, got boots, good recovered rod
OMG, the tapping is the music. I thought it was something in my room
I meant more for the sky character lol
Spinner you somehow always find it, as per the rule
My two modes are jet and trash
Jet but the seed is trash
With how distant checks are in this game I see a lot of potential starting routes and all have potential to be bad LMAO
That's one spot to put the hints alright
You will use the wooden sword and you will like it
Funny how the way to beat this temple is literally flooding it
Toad one cycle with wooden sword KEKW
2 hits spinning B&C is all it takes btw
Idk but now I see why the jump slash after the drop KEKW
Second phase is just hit based isn't it
Was gonna ask how many cycles but my answers were questioned
I forgot lanayru has a field and not just a spring
I'm gonna try and remember that shifting underwater is faster...
Poor guy was just minding his own bizz
I love this emote if you can't tell
yeah i had two encounters and two spook fails lol
The b in realblopez will soon stand for bop
my last pb was like a year and a half ago almost but i've only done 24 attempts since then
gonna eat and lurk, gl with rando
I think everyone hates this room
Btw the thing with the Aeralfos hint is that we don't create it if that wing is hinted nothing beyond this point
ooh, i feel that, my friend cancelled on me so i could've joined the race :')
In rando you can S+Q to retry west wing backwards btw
no one enjoys city, its ok
yeah im really bummed out i wasn't able to jpoin, but watching you guys sturggle makes me feel a little bit better
you already clear ag and lbt?
yeah i lost alot of time on the dukbest nonsence
my bighgest embarrasment was taking like twenty minutes on springwater rush lmao
Poe door open one of these days
i hate that theres n way to speedup ag, that first half is such a slog especially when you know its barren and its just searching for keys
I left for a bit... was MS in city?
I was gone lolz sue me
That was a wild flame skip
I'm currently in a dangerous spot... facing opposite sides of our dog... she may fart lolz
oh shit i got back to my room and my mom ordered me a pizza and its on the way
You can still do that check. There is a clawshot target
Will you do another seed after this race?
I wonder if when link gets off epona with zelda still on... he accidentally kicks her
One of those "when your misplay is a god play"
I think if you knew about S+Q in CitS then that would have saved a ton of time
I'll try to come up with a better poe 1 skip setup
Are you playing on a CRT?
Isaac... have you ever seen people get necessary items for hyrule and not beat dungeons?
It seems like your right side of the screen cutoff might be different. Idk though
You can't access HC if you don't beat the dungeons
That is what clears the barrier
Yeah you have to use the dev generator
trackerp site will likely turn into a site to give out asyncs for the tourney
It can be anything as long as it isn't actually a tracker lol
That is what the domain is supposed to be for lol
"Are you sure you wanna download this insecure files even though this isn't the first time?"
Scared the shit out of me
Rain's wii does this thing with the CD when turning on
Sounds like something is stuck...and then sounds normal afterwards
Strawberry kiwi is like the best flavor in anything
NOTED and i have to be lurking since my friends want to do the d2 stuff tomorrow ugh
Wish I can give more subs but I ish saving moola for stickers
Would links house count as ordon?
Just do vanilla fused shadows 4Head
Only thing is when you don't have rupees for Hena
Gorge sign is best when you have bombs since you can route with the EF sign
Which can be good if you don't know if EF is barren or not
Technically can do bombs + rang I think, but haven't done that is a very large number of years
Was in the HD speedrun at some point I think
Or something like that. Idk what it was in
TPHD is when I got back into TP
Or like when it turned out to be an obsession lol
I can't stand not having 8 notches on controller
Hey uh...what did I mess up in making a seed whereby I can't transform in front of people?
I think it is an option maybe
I know the quick transformation and I always click it
All the other seeds I did I could but this specific one it just...idk
I still can't get use to map warping
Oh in that case you can use the goron to shoot up top
Idk about this one. I meant for skipping entering the bomb shop
If I had a dollar for every time that was a sword
Is it better to target for that jump than to just jump?
I thought it said the bomb rock chest
Also Isaac you'd have a dollar
You'd have multiple? I wish a sword was always in there lolz
Now heart pieces on the other hand...
so I managed to DO the seed... it is definitely going down in hall of fame
I managed to figure it out and was absolutely blown away
that, and the fight against bowser was beyond brutal
I had items, but we had NO strength and NO ideal badges
the dumb thing kinda gate kept it, but I figured that out in about 20ish minutes I think?
not that I figured it out per se, but more so like "this cannot be it can it? Cuz ther- NO WAY!"
I was about to say, yes it made sense but I cannot think that this ever happened before till now
makes me look at every letter carefully now and check if it's well them
Holy crap you beat GM already?
so anyways how are you? howd your race go
If the nest check is a bomb bag I'll go fuck myself
I went to take a shower I had no fucking clue it was hinted in lanayru KEKW
Oh I need to check that out
I wish I could zoom in on emotracker
I have trouble finding the chests in mist
I meant for Stalfos grotto. I was wondering about this chest
Technically it is not as bad to go back for that one since you are guaranteed able to come from the portal
but does rando have the funniest goron in the game
Oh yeah wasn't it something good back there?
the one that just chills at the bottom of the fountain cause i guess gorons can breathe underwater?
i just love that guy cause he's completely unbothered by being in the fountain. just does not care
That's why we hint those lol
Yeah the snowpeak checks are awful
in my SS file, I'm RIGHT at the point to do the trial to get my clawshots
Oh no, does that mean Ook locks out rang lol
Poor ooccoo... had to witness that
just hookshot out of the water instead
I don't even know where they all are lol
Are you able to grab the compass chest?
that seemed like it... bugged you
@Mirby_Studios I followed you for that
Vanilla with a hint of chocolate
can confirm he did just follow me lmao
Might be able to do the same sidehop
So was that logically behind rang?
That fucked me over once btw...needed other rod and I'm like where didn't I go?? Did the fountain chest and boom recovered rod
The comments are all talking about how bad it was lol
Like almost all of them lol. One is just "Wtf Isaac"
Yeah it looked fine... probably just the double dip makes them upset?
Did you even have to double dip CitS though?
I will probably get the spoiler log to see where the bows were
Oh wait it isn't my fork so I can't get the spoiler log
It will be part of the next big update
Cheer95 I have 95 bits and idk why so here is 95 bits for being awesome
I'd give more and do 100 or something but I literally now have 0
and im glad to be the first
Oh! Today, I may become Affiliate!
I just needed the 7 days per month thing, and today should be 7
I'm ready to branch into more N64 roms and also get a screen capture and do more nintendo consoles mostly
No it just means it's good
If a bomb bag or bow cannot possibly be your first copy, then it isn't considered good
For example a bomb bag in LBT
From looking through spoiler logs, I feel like it is usually required
Oh I thought you meant for heart piece chest
If you manually aim bomb arrows when he is downed, I think it usually works better
I do like how that one hint in Snowpeak kind of sets the tone for the entire seed
That's why I would never do back to back matches in a tourney
Wow how many people was it?
All this just for vanilla progression
I usually just look down as they come to me
Did not see that coming lol
Was wondering what you were doing lolz
Wasn't your starting hint that both clawshots were overworld?
Sometimes it is important to do stuff in the order that your opponent's will
Since this one is naturally the first choice, it is pretty safe
Got excited for that quick sec
hey phantom gl on the seed
So was DDR complete bait lol
And a shield for zelda lolz
Did you already do spinner at lanaryu
You calling it a stupid thing and say you didn't peek is sus
That jump in South castle town
Did you do Lanayru Field checks?
Just got done with Fnaf world Nuzlocke, and then Fnaf 6 bankruptcy ending
At least you have a sword and lantern those can be very difficult to find
Did you get all of the Always hints?
It was, hope ya get good rng my friend
Oh crap was gonna say repeat
I love this puzzle, it's like playing tetris but bad
Thing that includes eldin bridge and iron
I don't stop until I get them all
I'm totally gonna hold that against you xD
That paired with the whole snowpeak thing is brutal lol
One of the biggest possible bait chains
What do you use to play the rando? I tend to use dolphin but it gets laggy in hyrule
wtf is the Shell blade grotto
You have to use Hyrule Field Speed Hack
Right-click the game > properties > patches tab
Flight by fowl... but in a corner under the cuckoo area
Even doing that its still laggy, but its a little more playable. But yeah just wondering
There's a grotto and poe :3
If you go to the TPR wiki, there is a Dolphin Guide page with tips for lag reduction
I'll be honest... this makes me wanna play oot
@AnniLyn2 Its probs my PC, need to upgrade it soon, just need the monies
I gotta ask why you transform on last one?
I can even put what bot said in tiny pieces
Oh my god it is 17 spheres
The other bows were both desert
I should probably do mine on my wii
Nice, I will stick around for another
I don't have Sometimes listed. They'll be in the Hints Explanation google doc for S1
So if you didn't know how to get the first lower level chest in CitS at the start, it is even worse
Since it is technically behind rang
The two worst things were getting the bug from GBoH when there was only 1 available check there, and then LBT was forced double dip
If you didn't follow the hints, you might delay trying that bug as well
Anyone else used the spinner everywhere when they were a kid...I always did lol, it was just fun
We could use it if there were limitations, but it changes the game way too much as is
I always say "imagine what any% would look like with that"
Fast spinner is fun, I wish the item returns in future titles
Yeah her hair is muy bonita
Btw what settings do you have on for the rando?
Just think, you paid your karma early in the run for better luck later
Im not as familiar with TP randos, whats items you need for "Go mode" for the final boss
Lot more than I expected actually, didnt think you needed boomer
I guess it depends what you need for the fused shadows
phantom why must my bracket fate always be lose round 1 into play 10 billion sets in losers to still get top16-8
I do not like how close link was to falling there that was scary
im sad i never finished this game bc my sister and i couldn't figure out the goron wrestling and then she broke our wii on accident
I am still consistently getting top cuts and I outplaced who I lost to r1 but still it's so much more playing LOL
nice! Havent seen that jump before
When I see gorons I start breakin shit idk bout you
Goron wrestling always gave me a hard time, so i dont blame your sis
IT WASN'T BC OF THAT LOL she was vaccuming and wasn't paying attention and it tore the cord and yanked the wii off the shelf
What if she was still seething about the gorons while vacuuming
"Oops my hand slip" destorys wii in half
phantom should I make taquitos or a sandwich for dinner
no it just that we stopped playing bc we didn't know what to do and now we dont have a wii anymore
I have m&ms does that work @trustyaltruist
The bot wants to smoke but it can't smoke tough like me runera3Swag
only if you start playing as a pacifist and stop killing bugs
i need a switch port so bad
I need to play peak dog game and play okami already it's been sitting on my steam library waiting
wait ahve you not played it before
I watched phantom play like 5 hours of it at midwest speedfest a few months ago lol
And then ohrocks bought it for me but then also told me to play kh2 so I played that with him instead so I blame him for why I haven't yet
imo the best console for it has been the switch bc of the touch screen
I planned to just play it on my ps4 controller
i also didn't originally finish okami as a kid bc i was scared of blight
My biggest thing with anything else singleplayer rn is I need to finish trails into reverie first but I'm at the end and I am not ready for a trails ending yet lol
and i just watched my sister beat it
I am very much expecting reverie to hit hard at the end there's a lot of buildup to shit rn
But yea my relationship with okami is literally just I think the dog looks cool and I see her on twitter a lot LOL
And I will always retweet doggee
if I'm not lazy af, we're making Chicken Hash tonight
Im the opposite, keep killing bugs
anyways brb I will decide my dinner destiny
cannot see / hear "spin to win" without thinking about this dude yelling about PM Link at the top of his lungs at a local
Dude said: "EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY LINK. ALL YA GOTTA DO IS UP-B. SPIN2WIN"
Funny too that brawl link is based on TP as well
I'll give you one sandwich if you do KB with iron boots
which is not a lot, but it's something
god fucking dammit lunar he takes away the fun
this is the same obstacle course they had at the town fair last week
The KB fight in the desert is there depending on settings
Thank god magnet walking is sped up
its cool taht link has blue hair and pronouns
Double claw was cuckoo minigame iirc
cancelling it out from killing animals
Ok I have taquitos in oven and I eat m&m while I wait
plus killing people too, link does that a few times
i make m&m cookies all the time
I remember seeing "harvest M&Ms" for the fall season
well these are m&ms with lil cookie biscuit thingies in them
I made vanilla pudding that turned out to be stale :/
Ok skittles in a sugar cookie
Mix skittles and M&Ms and make cookies, and lose friends
itd be like funfetti but crunchy
Reminds me of that post where someone proposed mixing skittles and m&ms into a bowl to fuck with people
what the fuck is up dennys
This emote is the perfect response to that message I think
Expensive... but best pancake and steak tips
Now I'm back to wanting steak
Steak and egg meal is pretty good there
Pancakes are fine but I am just never actively wanting them
Usually have them without syrup... not good on waffles
@buff00n You crave anything with sugar
the only waffles ive liked is from this regional chain bc they have amazing fried chicken
Yea I rarely ever pick sweet food
What are you guys putting in your pancakes??
This bag of m&ms is the first candy I've had for a bit
I am willing to feel like garbage
Sweets are too much for me in the morning
ive mostly given up on soda bc the sugar makes my stomache hurt rly bad
I just only drink diet soda when I have soda
I've hated the sugar taste of reg soda forever cause I only ever grew up with diet lmao
Sprite and dr pepper are the only reg's I will drink
i really just drink this grapefruit soda anymore but ppl make fun of it bc its called squirt
There's a sugar free/diet mountain dew?
i just cant with diet pop
Squirt is a very unfortunate name for a beverage LMAO
I tend to drink lemonade-tea half and half, itd pretty good
its just grapefruit flavor unfortunately named sprite ripoff
Didnt sierra mist get a rebrand too?
What I really like but haven't had in a while is cranberry juice
So night you guys...and preemptive phanto274GG for Phan
I always forgot how many chests were in the desert. its alot
I guess it means a lot of checks, but yeah its a lot to check
Oh i didny know that, neat
how come wolf link isn't blue
I want at least golden wolf
We recolor all of a texture at once. There is no nuance
golden wolf would light lantern caves too LUL
I love really long emotes when they dont work on the overlay yet
Also anything with eyes has texture around the eyes
I have seen rando mods replacing him with amaterasu at least
Gonna head out, its almost midnight for me. Have a good run!
I don't think it is feasible since we are making modifications are runtime
And we have really limited data size
youd have to get the texture pack and tint it the color and reinsert it or smth like that
Oh yeah maybe if you really understand the pipeline
Cosmetics just not the biggest priority right now
So I genned a Banjo Kazooie Rando seed and fired it up to see if I did it right. I was sitting on the press start demo screen, he collected a jiggy in R. B. B. and fell into a death plain. At respawn I had full control and thought I discovered "Demo Desync Adventure". While I did discover it, I just wasnt the "first" to discover it phanto274Ohoho Cheer100
Gonna be doing a coop with levias tomorrow
Banjo Kazooie, we both have never played it
Tooie is the lua hack, Kazooie runs on console
have you seen the tooie tracker?
cuz its the better banjo game
i will say tooie does lend itself better as a randomizeer tho
The level design is horrible and there's so many random downtime throughout it
You can spinner to the miniboss
so I didnt see any of the race, should I play it or was it god awful?
Objectively it was pretty bad I think
maybe ill just play to fused shadow then lol
My favorite racetime comment was "Wtf Isaac"
jcog just posted spike room in tubbas castle without speedy spin
But it is funny that it works
Hey just you wait till speedyless explodes as a category and it's required
What do you mean no rng to get the badge :D
do stallord skip and save 10 billion time
You can jump off immediately at the start of the fight btw
My mom has been playing ttyd remake since I got it for her for her bday and she keeps asking me to figure out stuff for her lol
Have you seen Polkamania by Weird Al yet?
to no ones surprise... he still has it
I have a setup in my race tips video
Weird al do know how to polka
ive seen spike do it a few times
sorry i was in a splatoon match i very like pinball fossil dino boss
cus no way this all is 1 seed
that sounds like the other seeds had some major clownface moments in their item placement
GM is like automatic -3 on the difficulty slider imo
if one wanted to plando nonsense
first hook in GM bow chest
Bow on CitS Double Clawshot chest
and Double Clawshot on Kak bow target practice as an example
with required GM, CitS and whatever else you wanna mash into that
Well you need 2 small keys
not surprised given you only got so many options to place smalls in lakebed no?
Only the 1 chest in this room can be a small key
Logic changed and that one can't be a key anymore
Since the other chests you logically pass by are 3-key locked
You can get nonsensical path hints
@Axl_SR tryin'a find what you're referrin to - would honestly be easier if you dm me which one in specific c.c
can one of the chests contain a nice treat so that link will smile
If you consider cheese or a pumpkin a treat
hes so sad in this one he needs smth nice
maybe he should just cheer up
Phantom what did you do to make the room horny
it literally wasnt doing anything you came into its house and started murdering it
we need to put link on trial for his numerous unprovoked murders
but it has to be THAT wall phantom we know this
where else is the HC item supposed to land
and i am gonna miss it Sadge
just askin cus that would influence whether its a 10 or 20 hour endeavor KEKW
if the items were to land in super shit locations and all I mean
yea thats still not as bad I would think
10 hrs if you start shadow crystal
hence why without that, its easily double the amount of time
eh - given poes, you could need it relatively early
I mean - its 60 OW + dungeon related checks
and if you get ONE insect which has something on ONE of the poes
bets you'll be fine is what I am tryin to say
that one I dont know how rough that can be
that doesnt sound near as bad as it could be
god I love the chair I am currently sitting on c.c
wooden kitchen chair with godknows how many years on its back now
and the seat is comin apart in the middle of it
bets his horse is summoned like when Phantom ganon has one
you killed anouther bug 😔 horse bug
GERUDO WARLORD OBLITERATED BY FARMYARD TWINK
Didn't you get the same starting clawshot hint 3 times
One had barren GD and FW, so it wasn't possible for that one
hope im not too late for GGs
It can be clawshot or boomerang for the starting hint. It is actually only 45% for clawshot
Only desert halves and purple mist
Since with reduced checks the others are kind of too strong
And you can get the owl statue hint if you see that dom rod is skippable on an Always hint
thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
ill watch tomorrow if you promise not to kill animals
sparkle was doing TP any% but think they are done now
whaaaat you dont like that game havin official postgame now...?
God remake is so slow LOL
Phantom5800 is now live! Streaming The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess: All Dungeons Keysanity Full Randomizer | !socials #Ad !ZZZ
generating seed, gonna use the bathroom and should be ready!
wdym the seed's still in the oven, no way tippiAFirret boosterLurk
OH, the show hasn't started yet
I know the game this comes from FUUUUUUU
fuck it - steam tell me
ye grandia 2 music is grand
about my only like - "complaint" is the length of it
but thats very VERY not complaint
Jonxhas, I didn't see your message, I was just yelling about Grandia
I hope you're taking notes, chat, this WILL be on the test
catsittingverycomfortablecute which bets you will be
@buff00n tldr: allsanity with QoL start
I'll mark you down for extra credit, Jonxhas
thats a small rea even, neat!
local farmboy goes to village shop, just casually buys the keys to the throne room of the kingdom
it would be HILARIOUS if you rolled a 60 poes for a gold insect seed KEKW
sl 1/30th of the way to 60 tippiAFirret
yo worse bombchus in lantern cave tippiGiggle
man I wish that bomblets would do ANYthing in this
barren should I think still exist
i had a dream i was watching your stream and made a lewdish joke and you didn't find it funny. of all the dreams to remember it was that lmao
you just RIPPED HIS HEART OUT
@Mirby_Studios its fine, somehow a whole wheel of cheese survived the bite of a wolf as well KEKW
one whole wheel of cheese, intact
and you'd expect cheese not to survive that 🤣
suuurely you need 20 poe souls immediately KEKW
I ate pizza today that was basically all cheese and bread, no sauce :(
seeing wolf link in this particular room....
@gothiczelda didya at least have some onions to go with that?
link knows his way around cheese, he did herd the goats that give the milk the cheese is made from
Nah I just wanted cheese pizza from costco, had to go there today but it sucked
Hello there, how is the rando going so far?
next time ya cheese pizza, you just grab like 1 onion, cut it down to lil cubes or half rings, across the pizza, light extra cheese
mostly so that the onion dont burn while bakin
Is there a way to quickly set up a seed with race settings?
yea thats definitely a junk hint KEKW
as in "full garbo hint" junk hint, not useful KEKW
What type of logic does this seed have?
TP is best Zelda game because holding kitties and puppies
@gothiczelda hear me out: the best zelda game then is real life
cus you can lay down and get cat baked
Agatha, how did she do Arbiter's grounds before we did
Weed + Cat + Bed + Steam Deck = the best
@gothiczelda I would take pizza over weed and steam deck - good fooooood PrideUwu
yesterday I spent like 4 hours just dreaming off mashed tatoes with green beans and MAYBE a sausage
She must be the Hyrule Warriors version of herself
Mashed potatoes are S tier food
Do you think this will be a full clear seed?
my grandma made SUCH a good combo of that, extra taste came from lil bacon cubes and milk mixed into the mashed tatoes
that poe also DOES want you to do the entire thing
logic worked in a way I didnt think it would so I was stumped for a while lol
so I had world entrances shuffle but exit is vanilla, so I entered mumbo mountain which took me to freezeezy peak. But when you leave youre at freezeezy peak in the lair.
Mine had 2 swords in castle My ordon sword was behind Iza 1 and castle was behind completion of city and two other dungeons
kazooie rando with that level shuffle setting is fun tippiTap
my preferred way for SM64 rando actually, to make it be like that
I mean what are bottles in this game if not inventory fill KEKW
the few moments you need to have oil, you just get it
I wanna try the meme category, 420 notes, 69 jiggys KEKW
and you dont need no potions or nothing for aaaanything else
Do you plan on finishing this rando in one stream?
wanted to have levias help me out but they werent free
getting to clearing dungeons I feel like will be the actual longest, no?
Desert access would be nice for those clawshots and tons of checks
what if that one is behind smashing rocks
there's a good couple options in kak
how much is included as potential item pool? yes
cave of ordeals is not even that bad
now what would potentially be rough right
isnt there a poe before spinner blockade in there?
if thats the insect that has spinner KEKW
if its 13, its behind spinner ye
or am I silly and it just did line up to flat 500 KEKW
must be silly, cus its 300, 600, 1000 c.c
just thinkin cus I could swear you can see the extendo wallet without it being full
if you get ball&chain, you only really would need 1 right?
to be fair for Snowpeak, I am thinkin fullclear
so 1 for fullclear if you ONLY have ball&chain?
definitely would be surprised if I got that right given I only played like 5 randos of this
prelude of light - 2nd note long
1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th ar ehalf
still tryin to think cus there's like ONE of the songs I dont know which they refer to
The first equipment is heavy shoes
@Rgamer0 clanker boots are go mode
cant go without them, best credits
imagine if rando shuffled the ruppees on the cannon house that launches you
game is at 475 checks so im down for more
shuffling only ruppees would be interesting too
imagine if a no fucks given every pot and crate too
so the only major thing you have is boots?
Feels like with the amount of buggies we're getting that spinner could be next
did you submit what you want for season 3? Id like to go back to 7 spirits
howl setups y didnt do yet at DM -> ordon, upper ZR to here, Lake hylia to GD right?
ye just try<in to memo if i am right
Hero of time better have the gud stuff
what if he has the ro v2
prelude of light = good song
Thanks great how many times grandpa
Remember to praise your great X grandpappy hero of time for getting you something in your time of need
wolf can bite that switch no?
Yeah probably bombs to clawshot is the next item progression
i love how a lot of the wolf howls are just past ocarina songs
@Mirby_Studios they ALL are except for like one I think
Well OoT Lonk wants to teach his bloodline a lesson on how to be the Hero
after being stuck in the lost woods for forever yea
oh i'm very familiar with requiem of spirit
my fiance goes by maddrequiem and for a bit i had that as their ringtone lol
specifically the part from familyjules's ocarina song medley
You learned to warp to the spirit temple, now go get silver gauntlets and a vanity shield
It would be funny if there was ever a cross OoT and TP rando
this one I dont know which song it is
4th note 1.5, 5, 6th are half
but yea - wish I knew THIS ONE's origin
@Rgamer0 at this point, truly just wait for TPR in AP
if and from there when it happens on a very unknown ETA
lake hylia's is apparently goron lullaby
it's missing like the first note or two
I think my brain's just in need of hearin them side by side
cus yea I can think of the couple notes where its makin sense
the only one that isn't apparently is the hidden village one
like - thinkin from the cutscene when you learn the song
it's the light spirit theme over the hyrule field theme but slower
hidden village one is a medley on the hero of twilight right?
would make sense with the mix of hyrule field + ight spirits
death mountain is song of healing, upper zora's river is requiem, sacred grove has both prelude of light and zelda's lullaby, lake hylia is goron lullaby, and snowpeak trail is ballad of gales
ballad of gales for the snowpeak one is funny
so we got ONE song which somehow made its way to links head from a timeline where this hyrule shouldnt even exist KEKW
oh my god i almost forgot
years ago when i was making a game in RPG Maker i was using an ordon village MIDI as a town theme
i legit forgot until i just heard that here lmao
it's a good town theme okay!
Who needs a horse, be a Husky or Malamute instead
just not the one we a players get to play, but the one we hear from the cutscene
remember how in the wii u version of hyrule warriors the spinner was locked behind the link amiibo
TPHD has had an entire cave of ordeals section locked behind the wolf link amiibo
that was peak of amiibo, they needed to show off multi-game functionality
and then you could have wolf link companions based on your progress through that and TPHD in BotW
does tht one go into a door?
when Amiibo went from neat lil' bonuses to actual modes / features / content stuck behind the things I started hating them
the fact that just happened though
yes you dont have like 1000s worth of audio clips KEKW
1st chest forest temple but I dont think climbing the 1st wall is doable cus of the skullwalltulas?
link thats not how throwing shit works
you dont just load up the thing you hold with a rocket when targeting something KEKW
give me back the funky nut throws
okay, I am learning a LOT about TP today
you can barely make this work
I renember you messing with it
still though: why do these deku nuts have such a high speed travelin path KEKW
the book is part of the sky character total to the tracker yea
this is the ONE poe which without actively flying here, you might just never see, right?
I dont recall you gettin that hint but *shrugs*
worst case its a minute of a minigame
bomb bag purchase since we're at it?
renember that one seed where you had that crazy thought?
I wouldnt even put that off as a joke
but as an actually interesting thing
if you wanna have chaos nonsense KEKW
you know that a good idea
where every fish is an item if you let it be that way
@Jonxhas zootr have the fishing rod shuffle
fishing rod shuffle sounds like NOT what I am talking about blacktiger
1 shuffles the actual fishing rod, the other shuffles the fish you catch
you was talking about the fish shuffle
because its the closest to what it would be here
problems to tackle if you were to are a) making sure you still get your score for the minigame itself
i was just telling you zootr have the actual rod shuffle KEKW
b) making sure the item models work
@blacktiger51 thats fair, just tryin'a say that I wasnt necessrily on the train of "oh look crazy settings" but "oh look similar enough to relate to setting"
Do you have a map that shows where checks are or is this all memorization??
cus the problems of a object based shuffle for a minigame like this boils down to it looking as "non-jank" as can be so to speak as well as it making sense to actively have it be done
and plum minigame has like what, a total of about 60 fruit balloons?
@Jonxhas you want something crazy combo rando is getting door shuffle at some point every single door take you somewhere rando ass door in fire can take you to a shop
@blacktiger51 I have seen the talk of what zoey has cooked up yea
not surprised about zoey and nax figuring things of that degree out
ESPECIALLY given what I have seen done by zoey in MMR before that already in terms of "it feels natural" features
just bc I aint lookin at 1 specific person's content dont mean I dont see what the dev channel which everyone can read goes on about or what goes on in the commits
@Jonxhas i never looked at dev talk KEKW
@blacktiger51 yea see I look at the commits
so I know whats actively new
and I saw zoey talk about the door rando craziness somewhere else
and given I know what a potential plan for MMR ER looked like - I am not surprised
very on brand for stuff zoey would do
what about the goron shops in market?
or do they not count as shop
lemme rattle through them by region on the OW
ordon vil: sling, sword, shield, boots, rod, HP
referring to what it would be vanilla obv.
are we sure it'll still work?
then I know you did Ordon GW
did you do the poe in mist area?
saw you do the rest there
saw you do the poe, bug checks
Kak gorge I saw you do poe, OoL double claw chest
did ya get both eldin grasshopper checks?
not sayin ya didnt just rattlin me brain
where does emotracker shove the packs again
I wanna look at that ye
maybe because you could irons down, throw rocks at them from down below?
I never owned an xbox myself but the 360 market place could shut down as early as in 20 minutes. Its the end of an era.
return hasSword() or has("Ball_and_Chain") or has("Progressive_Bow") or (hasShield() and has("Progressive_Hidden_Skill", 2))
What a disgusting thing to do
so no fucked logic just SUPER niche case
At least we can progress again
At least we'll be getting the clawshots...soonish
we back in prog land baybeeeee
this the gross shit allsanity give you KEKW
that niche toadpoli grotto can happen with race seeds too
just VERY MUCH SO more rarely
And a mandatory double dip to get armor to come back with a bow for a sword
^ THAT is the bigger jank truly
then again zora armor didnt play a role
the hidden skills were the chain of oof
Oh yeah the two hidden skills for the shield bash as well
Always remember shields are valid bashing weapons
This mine has a sense of humor
its called Goron Memes for a reason pugSit
It's like game we earned that clawshot
if it is hawkeye, it'd be fucked
cus that means your first logical clawshot would have to be the GD one
Okay we might have a shot at a Clawshot
hawkeye woulda been FUCKED for first clawshot
Whelp time to go back there
we're still 5 letters and a book away from the sky anyway
City in the sky just gatekeeping stuff
that tektite was looking for his bike and you KILLED HIM
I dunno why but I wanna call out the desert memo being soon in this logical mess
or next step feels 2nd fishing rod
you got a couple keys and cheese
only 42 more and you get a BOMB BAG
it could be like a wet lighter
this lantern in fact was not filled with water
still have a wooden sword almost 3 hours in too
it just resided in a place filled with it
It's a rusty lantern with mold, that's a problem in of itself
Please excuse Lonk for being dimwitted, he's not the holder of the triforce of Wisdomm
but mr gun soldier, that wasnt a lantern
that was extra funny while holding the bomb
Welcome to either hype or trite
so DM woth is for the poe then?
there's the haha funny long chain
sooo... gamba between it being a sword, rang or ball&chain?
cus it could be for light sword
So I'm expecting AG BK from Agatha soon
crazy that they JUST got a pohoto of a living one
I ate too much for dinner and am now bloated and don't wanna move
Yeah I only knew of them from animal crossing
I knew about them for a while
Just 5 rupees from Xmas number
What other Zelda randomizers do you do?
what do you use to keep track of Total playtime? seems kinda fun to use since dolphin doesn't have it as a feature.
I can turn you into a windwaker fiend
Do you have enough small keys to full clear the desert province?
And Agatha has AG BK and she had the spinner
I never knew that chest was there
How fast do you think you could beat argorok with the wooden sword?
@Hyaaathehero argorok needs ordon or higher ye
Last boss make it hard somehow
@jonxhas I would like to keep argorok as a pet
imagine oddities like with ganon in OoT
Get a kitty and name him argorok
aaand we got a part of cave of ordeals unlocked!
Wait you're doing cave of ordeals too?
Is it just me or should the memo and sketch have switched colors since with the colors switched, they would have the color of the scent in the region
The hint says it's required so embrace the pain
You get it in one try lolz
What are the best and worst zelda minigames in your opinion?
when goin down there you just let the stream take ya
you lost enough to not have a shot at winning yea
it rly doesnt, just the current being the current
it does take you left based on where you go down the shoot before
if you are on the left half, it goes left around, if you are on the far right, it tries to suck you left but fails at it
cus its tryin to counter too much distance
and what sucks is that you cant help the current
Helping her requires you to meet up with the Zora so it forces you left
Is it worse than the fun fun island minigame from skyward sword?
Almost no control? I'd say none at all
5 times wall rub is the most you can if you oget all the pots yea
you can learn to do this minigame rubless but its not fun
and like I do like this minigame on paper
the next bit here is rough as shit
you cou are now further left meaning that pillar is in the way
and the current here is arse
like - you have to get that triple for rubless and IMMEDIATELY get link to actually shimmy towards the right HARD
I was thinkin you would hit the rubble before that last set
Then you watch the mini cutscene as a fuck you
I would dare say (personal opinion) isa trouble minigame and then like Spoosh kaboom are rough
there is at least a tracker to cheat it with probabilities
there were no jump charges in either seed
it's fine, but just doing jr was more tedious
Where's the Palace of Twilight small key radar
Collect all 7 of them to summon the eternal dragon and get a wish
What if the bugs that lead to arbiter's grounds keys are in arbiter's grounds?
The hunt for the AG BK bug
What is the difference between gerudo desert and desert province?
cave of ordeals is junk right
monkaW so you telling me you might have to do it
What happens in this game if you try to go through the wrong side of a locked door?
on laptop so imma be few secs or so behind
how'd you stop boar so gently lolz
if Hyrule castle is set to vanilla
otherwise, its potentially skippable given that your last mirror / fused shard isnt on zant
King bulbin isn't that bad with backslice and link hovers in the air upon his defeat
a meat pinata with a key inside. only mildly concerning
@AnniLyn2 Rolling with iron boots on does damage in this game. I am pretty sure it is the same as an ordon sword swing
Well it ran out of things to burn since sand needs something hotter than a wood fire to burn
Could this be the bug that is the AG BK
We did in order to get the Spinner
Cheer100 kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, kkona: e,,,,,, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,, he, hè, hé, hê, hë? ,,;,,; e, è, é, ê, ë? ;;;;; whe, whè, whé, whê, whë? ,,,,,
didn't need to even look at chat to know that Raven el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
I like that one he sounds way happier than the why
Which is this big hub that blocks 2 BKs
has anyone ever done a bug seed?
all the important items are given by bugs...bugs are just scattered
@AnniLyn2 So agitha has the entire item wheel then?
I got a Morgana from Persona 5 figurr
I also got a Clodsire plush
Huh, never seen a TP rando
Also nothing like my ace ass constantly watching this YouTuber discuss NSFW Japanese only visual novels
Some of them look rly cool
is the scent randomized too lolz
No, though the first 2 scents are unobtainable
My outfit today gave me some strange gender euphoria
It was a black tank top and cargo pants
Also fingerless gloves that I eventually removed
did you pull off kim possible?!?!
But I took the top layer off cuz heat
What would be nice is another sword
oh wait you said tank top...not crop top
I like confusing people on my gender
I'm nonbinary, but I'm more fem leaning
So I just call myself female
just the black top and cargo pants made me think kim lolz
Cuz I tried He/Him, didn't like it
Isn't this song from wind waker?
But it's fun to make people guess
Do you think you will have to race Yeta?
Had someone modded Link into a Tony Hawk game yet
Someone probably modded botw link into one of those games due to the variety of shields to surf on
so you are planning to beat this tonight right
I can't believe fuckin Agatha made it into Warriors
It would be funny if it was vanilla B&C
Imagine if Agatha has the B&C
did you donate to the guy
Good thing is...a higher chance you'll find the helpful ones now
Still wanna get the rang though
Save keys like we save money
Would you ever do a randomizer with ice traps set to maximum
What are you trying to attempt?
I know that feeling... just one fucking thing
Time to get that massive hub out of the way
so gale rang is fyrus, CItS BK in forest
and Death Mountain has ball and chain
cus you had the alcove chest hinted ded
yea but also what could it be at this point
BKs should fall out the question, right
Sword will at least get us into ToT
So yeah think it's a sword hunt
Why do you wolf before the entrance?
would you rather what a tree grow or a knee grow?
worst temple in the game btw
wtf you're still not done? I look away for 2 hours and this is what I come back to?!
Should try it... heard it was thrilling
the rod is gonna be in the next chest
how tf did allyson go live before jesse did again
She like just started and is trying to figure out how to turn on alerts lol
have you dont lake bed yet?
When did you get ball and chain wtf
do you use an emulator for randomizers?
Rain told me a dad joke I gotta say
Always say mucho around your Hispanic friends
It means a lot to them
like Grah keep it a stack
earlier you said this run might be 10 hours and i thought you were joking… but now? idk
I still see a couple BKs missing monkaSTEER
I was distracted by an MMR seed
okay no I didnt hear that
at least cave of ordeals is a decent amount of action and not juuust snoozefest
GG on the first boss of the seed
which rang = fyrus I member that
so we are basically in domrod / sword search mode
and one of those is past fyrus too
didya go do memory stuff for the wolf lready or nah?
yea I thought that, but didnt think it starts with the rod
thought it starts with the book
and poe1 skip is mostly for key skippin
teach PGB to ban the keyphrase BEST VIEWERS
dont need PBG for that even - twitch built in features can do that
like - I got a whole range of those blocked, but they still finid their ways even if ya do it
i bet its just twitch fucking with people KEKW
its actually just me on all my alts
but I dont wanna kill serif, its such a neat subset of fonts Madge
how do you think the canon chars handle deathwarps
"did the hero of time just kill themself in a pit over there?" "are we fucked?"
Sounds about a right amount to kill a ghost
wouldnt say "something past this point" good stuffs?
If only we can fight fyrus...wait a second we can't
so who's ready for the gauntlet soon?
Welcome to the game master sword
leads to Snowpeak clear for sure
At least bosses won't take a million years to clear anymore
leads to both an item and gales
and we need a domrod for armogohma
I'm telling you...7 hours at most
have we been in Snowpeak already?
You still gotta go to cave for forest temple BK
cus then since Fyrus HOPEFULLY does not hold the domrod behind clear
like - I honestly wanna lean domrod behidn fyrus
You and stallord are the best of frenemies
stallord 1cycle with ordon is rough
At least we don't have to do that anymore
I THINK you can do it without
like - this lineup of spike traps is "3rd phase"
yea definitely wanna say ordon 1cycle is doable because of this
cus this was oly what, 1 or maybe 2 spinputs from getting it
hello hello how has this seed been
BUT starting to finally look up
so - I wanna say that this is still close ish to the 10hrs range I thought yesterday
also what are we even thinkin with ordon spinputs
you had master sword for stallord there
we didnt get any info for ordon spinputs
One in a hot place, one in a cold place, one in a dead place
I missed... what did agitha give?
I wish I knew the angles for this well
at leas this ooccoo spot is not bad
forest temple cant get to the back half
Still looking for third key shard
otherwise it would have to be a bug for a key
like - odds are high for domrod2 being wotH
and theres still 2/3 things at agatha
So a 25% shot of the ToT small
do you need to beat each boss?
And the pain of knowing where it is
rang on fyrus for diobaba, mines last key shard in Temple of time key / domrod locked, CitS big key is in Forest temple as well
and bedroom key is behind armogohma in Hyrule castle
ye just that its not inside the castle itself
so with other words: most of the seed is solved
just that 1 puzzle piece away from a full clear
Wait I thought you were going back up..
You... you know you could climb up there right?
its rare in runs or randos that you need to do the climbing in the block puzzle room but yea thats a way back up
I didn't mean for it to come off wrong :/
just this seed being a smol drain tippiTap
Now can that one bug be the key
but also the key can now be ono the couple non-key locked, 1 domrod checks
and if its not key, hope that bedroom key is on armogohma, chain dungeon rush
super tempted to get taiko on switch with the taiko drum... I really wanna try it
did you get to try it?
though I wanna bet that this is the ToT small key
you got minimum 2 things still
truly wish that ooccoo were a per dungeon FW
or could be turned into one such thing somewhat easily
thanks twitch Madge just typed " o7 good ooccoo spot"
if it is would be real neat
cus thats fyrus and blizetta access
and diobaba is very close still
with boomerang, you got full range Forest temple access
for forest temple BK we need 2nd domrod
and there is a decent odds chance for that
given that the rang is 100% on fyrus
and domrod HAS to be the one at or after death mountain
like - the WORST case now is it being bug for ToT small for domrod in ToT
cus I wanna BET domrod in Death mountain poe
just kinda sucky that this seed forced more then half the dungeons without rang
Sucks that another dive had to be made into this place which had 2 secret skills, a sword, zora armor and the rang
90 bucks plus shipping, excited to try it
And the hylian shield for insults
the game itself was only 20
if you buy that from nintendo its 50 lol
who'd not do fyrus at this point KEKW
if it'd not be a race settings seed with keyshuffle anywhere
this chest doesnt even feel farfetched to dip for
depends on the scenario I feel like
Useful if you know how to use it right
the boomerang is on the shard check? KEKW
might as well go and do the letter prepwork for hidden village now
then just nab the WotH stuff rather then extra minigames
hawkeye realistically can only be good if it is the small key leading to a boss key
which you know all of them
CItS BK is solved by rang
thats 3rd poe or final item
whats your PoT requirements at? mirror?
cus All dungeons does list requiring all dungeons
and why would PoT not be "a dungeon"
cus I mean - it is
how many small keys does one need there?
cus you have the light sword
just need to do the bulbmin whatever thingy hunt
then the howl stone works after
just sayin cus that place is flag hell
yes you need to talk to floof cat
also I got no clue what specifically links to zant
Omg I laughed and almost woke rain xD
with 5 small keys it does already list everything but central tower chest, zant and HC check in there as just doable
so I would ASSUME that you're just able to do it
and not worry about keys ye KEKW
did agitha have a PoT small?
and if so: did she hand it over
lowkey though: links crossbow training was kinda hype
does one even have to actively sneak this
thelast one is in dummy corner
last 4 are up middle up middle half length
For some reason by ear it sounds like up down rather than up middle
the fact this wolf has value before entering Hyrule Castle KEKW
in vanilla this is among the most "useless" ones
Great grandpa Hero of Time also had the bug that locked the spinner
time to sleep? okay Bedge tippiGiggle
unlocking bedrooms with the hero of time
I was joking on the bedroom key
I got to stay wakey for another 11 hours minimum
He just loved to sleep and spin around
I know...was gonna say bedroom key not for yous
@Rgamer0 what is time travel in OoT if not that
so - is it floor 39 or 50
if I got the numbers for the poes right
So he was basically a Husky
so can we gamba on that? it is a 50/50 KEKW
as for the Lakebed small: I wanna BET its because of key logic
not that you can reasonably not pick it up
cus the poes will be in the way anyway
So... we're gonna be here a while longer than 7 hrs
I'd say quick finish from here at 8h30?
This seed demanded you dive an Asian death 11 times.  Diababa is more like DIEababa
10hrs was my garbo logic highball time thought yesterday
which it feels like that wasnt too bad an estimate
also though: double it if it wasnt a shadow crystal start
Boss rush on Blizetta, Diababa and Zant
This seed demanded you go everywhere for progression
hyrules economy yet again in shambles
local farmboy running around with armor which for draining the financial resources dry prevents him from taking damage
he got 3.5k on his name
no other person in hyrule even knows those amounts
Like is it the same as majoras mask where the frog grabs you into his bubble and beats the shit out of you
@AnniLyn2 except the frog in Majoras can softlock you
if you try to escape it by mashing buttons
a to that point rather commonly used practice to escape damage
yet in Majoras, you can just softlock yourself in the bubble by accident
and your only way around that is to not resist and take the hits
Majora...I love you... but you suck for that
checking back in before bed. Congrats on 4 dungeons and good luck with the rest
If only chuchu jelly did something for other colors than yellow
@Axl_SR floor 44 poe has Forest BK
do you know the otherr ordeals item?
The alpha dungeon locks the omega one
the rest is all basically garbo
a logic required lakebed small was already got
Diving deeper into the rabbit hole
and the other ones are... "lamp oil, rope bomb" worthy
looks like go mode outsidde of keys needed
look at how easy these floors are
the hard floors I'd say are a couple more
"fair" hard is like triple darknuts or double darknuts + aerolfos
and then you got like 2 or 3 which got freezards
the ability to deal damage with bomb arrows to freezards
that alone would make them trivial for cave of ordeals
You got regular, annoying, difficult, and triggering
nice thing about this vod is ill have a super long youtube vod to play while I sleep LUL
the reason domrod 2 is woth!
I take the triple darknuts over a single freezard
if they are on their own
bets you'll understand why I wrote that
I use helm splitter on them
you CAN bait the double single
btw if you take out their armor then can throw their sword at you while you are up there
but its a very small window where you drop off the platform
this room doesnt even classify as a room
its just a chamber of nothing
to get hit in this room you'd have to be starved on resources
AND have no good hidden skills
you just deal with the aerolfos first
can we just finish the last 6
true chuchu jelly or whats it called
the one which basically is fairy tears when scooped
so full heal + soup double damage if you didnt snipe it
so... I did this cave once on 3 hearts
IF you have the 1k wallet and magic armor anyway
doesnt restrict the amount of upgrades or bomb bags
its definitely sucky on that regard
but like - the darknuts you can deal with via mortal draw VERY worst case
and if bow / bomb bag upgrades are not out the question
that makes it a bit harder
you cant skip ending blow yea
this one you can also again have only 1 at a time
you just need to ledge grab fall off the platform and play the one below ya very careful like
also against darknuts, I feel like the only like "decent" hidden skills are the backslash thingy, before mortal draw
cus it rly hinges on you having helm splitter to be useful
and its very easy for that to bait you into damage
for that cave of ordeals acheevo
you are allowed a bottle right
so that being a fairy is allowed too
I forgot city was still in this
as long as there's no low% subset yet KEKW
I really dont wanna set myself up staring at rupees
EVEN IF I am allowed to use the fast forward
yea nah I am not doin that one
like - sure, I did do hoverless SMS subset
but that mostly was bc a) I wanted to help someone out with patching their end for that
and then from there b) I had it set up already
so why not just do it
I should look at the TP set
worse then that I feel like is knowing where all of them are
it got better odds to be caught in a random cave then in the fishing pond
or does it NEED to be caught in the fishing minigame
what I dont like? the amount of bosses you HAVE to do within certain restrictions
like Ook on ordon sword without him throwing his rang more then 2 times
essentially if the cutscene is counted, being 1cycle
yea and imo that sorta shit is iffy
fishing subset would be a good thought imo
cus thats a fairr amount of stupid
yea I saw that just now
and the 3heart stuff in all honesty should also be a subset
but would it make the main set less rough for a casual enjoyment?
like - have you seen the LM set?
there's 1 in there requiring you to suck a boo of 150 hp or more within 1 room
meaning you NEED to learn the speedrun pump strats
like - sure, I like me some mild speedrun challenge
but it really feels like if that should warrant a subset
you know the Pikmin 1 / 2 challenge mode?
but yea to pikmin 1 / 2 challenge mode
Yeah... did you already do snowpeak?
the 1 challenge mode cheevos on RA were initially at times VERY close to the perfect scores of the area
because the amount of micro you would have to do for pikmin 1 is ROUGH
pikmin 2 challenge mode is similar ish in that sense
pikmin 2 has a VERY much so more generous control QoL line
there's exactly ONE of the pikmin 2 challenge cheevos where I would think its rough
and 2 to 3 extra which are on the edge
I so wish I was this good
Will you play pikmin on stream one day ?
I dont get why fishing needs to be in the pond
you can get all the fishing book entries without sitting in the boat
that would have sufficed for a main set imo
and then ya make a 3heart set and a fishing subset
Fishing in tp is relaxing and stressful at the same time
but I rly would say just make a 3heart subset
and turn the heart pieces and containers into rupees
I am currently "just" doing the LM and the PMD red rescue team
and very much so not in a hard rush rn
cus I got some irl stuff which needs attention
and if its not that, its pape
minish cap would be very close 2nd though
how fucked is the TMC set
but then again I did do that like what, 10 times casually or so?
so I just do it without thinking
yea see I never manip'd for it
I just went to the west field and mowed the lawn
farmed both shells money and that
not even using the sips from farore, din, nayru
but then again I also "just do" the figurines in windwaker
as much as I KNOW its a slow as fuck thing to do
like - it takes 5minutes if you know what you're doing
Those would be convoluted but awesome mugs
fair I did in fact not think of PoT time sink
ok i took a nap for a couple hours are we in go mde
Having the fact of their symbols there
unless there's some fucked up reason we need the smalls for PoT
and the ONLY place I think which phantom didnt full clear is ToT
the other dungeons he got to are cleansed
Maybe after blizzeta... take a peak at hyrule see if it's opened
what if both are set to AD
I mean... you already have light sword and there isn't much left
In order to fight zant and Ganon
PoT can be "vanilla (beat CitS), open, fused, Mirror"
and HC can be AD and any of the rest
but given you had set HC to AD
suuurely the sign has info for the smalls yea
and not the one you got
I can't see but how many pot smalls you have?
also OFC my 2nd guess was the one
Oh I have to hear for cracking huh?
ye you wanna hear the crackle but not the breath
the other thing is 8 rung steps up the ladder as your call to do the drop
I remember you explaining this trick
8th one interrupted like phantom did
if you look at it in any of phantoms climbs, you can see it easily
The most painful thing is to learn lja
also always is links left hand doin that one
I tried to but it's just not working out
cus rando its slightly harder I feel like
cus link climbs a bit quicker
its definitely among the easier things to learn
All they need is love, no need for shiny wallet
cus they love each other like its all money in the world
Walk through center makes more sense
The sides are all because you need to get the sols
is it actually part of his behavior?
I swear if that valid concern
so you keep some keys for that
cus the left and right side are troves of chests
I meant more to not get keylocked
I mean there is Zants hand master
cus I do renember you had a silly keylock in lakebed
which arguably was more unreasonable for glitchless item placement
1 keylock is enough for me to think its worth to safety
even if this rn is in the gltchless key use realm
Oh shit because there are chests on the sides...damn..
I agree with that for race seeds
I gotta admit... no but like the palace is still crazy interesting
cus like - this is SUCH a long haul for a single check of worth behind a BUNCH of key locks
which means you HAVE to play this area vanilla even if you dont want to
otherwise hopefully its in here honestly
cus this is the quickest dungeon to go back for
I had a crush on zant when I first played this... then he took off the mask
That and he started acting like a crazy kid
the idea of his fight is fun
but MAN is it long winded
but rando? yea can quickly get on ones nerves
I never connected that this is on south HF
I thought this was just some made up area meant to look arena like
I've never seen such a mixture
zant sometimes loves being a cookin aid
must make for a 5 star salad
Not made to be king but... great chef
Wait you have a big key?
90minutes until my 10hr estimate is iffy
big key for here was just in ordon
it was the FIRST ITEM phantom picked up KEKW
that and if it fails, back to PoT I'd say
AG, GM, FT, SPR, CitS are all clear right
and then Lakebed has like 2
Oh yeah the domrod 2 checks...
funny that this game is so much about domination
when all link rly wanted to do is want to be a goat farmer
and should just have had a simple, easy trip to hyrule castle to deliver a sword
Let this be a lesson to everyone..
WHY did you mention health phantom
I mean... when you look at it... we all need health
morshu why you lettin us have all this?
can we get the bomb bag or will we go mode before? KEKW
if you get to 1 remaining
that being that one you just said
can we meme get that one?
thats what I meant KEKW yes
man those unwieldy metal slabs musta been a pain to even make usable as a sword
I never knew you could just shoot that painting off the wall
THAT'S how you get to them
the WotH of Death Mountain is fulfilled on DomRod to FT BK
then which other WotH areas did ya have
cus item specific hints dont count as such, right?
what was up there? clawshot was region hinted, so didnt count
You know in vanilla where they come and help by the big key?
bugs leading to shit would count
@AnniLyn2 I do like that this is the one gam where you get active help
and not in the groose mcLoose screws way
and then 16 and 3/5ths outta 20
You gotta factor in the power of friendship
the problem? it is reachable with 1 hook
so that could be any depth
given I reckon WotH hints are placed logically once minimum
I mean... are they telling us to go back to palace?
it could just be for clear
BUT we dont know until phantom checks
cus it COULD very well be that there's something on lower key req levels
fair, cant argue with that math
spring rush was done before first sword
cus buying a shield was a puzzle no one at the time thought of :D
it is a long winded check
if Kak Hawkeye and HP related is it
Someone uh... lemme know where it was because I'm heading to bed. 2:30
A very much great preemptive phanto274GG for you
I swear I will feel bad if its hawkeye
cus I essentially was like "nah prog, no way" 😅
I legit did not think of them cus my brain thought "oh yea that'll work out"
22/24, 53/60, 18 and 3/5ths of 20, 5/7
yet only 1/3 of what we want
you can just straight race her btw
unless it got changed to behind a checkbox
which reasonably could have happened since I last played this obviously
didnt even know that the jumps would help w speed
did I miss a poe soul? tippiTap
and yes these do need the sol
you can still get these 2 here
then use them for the way to the chests
by the light switch you just used to hop up
just long winded paths they take
its like a double L shape
this room is the worst offender of it though imo
cus it hides this switch there
and makes that the consistent way up
that small key is not skippable
me thinkum good no eekum bokum in this here brain nuh-uhhh
just sucks we have to deal with a floatmaster
cus I dunno if that thing can ever count as either floor or wallmaster
WAY easier to nab with lightsword over the sol
so 5keys minimum key logic to get through the first door of the climb to zant logically ey
master sword SHOULD BE this strong
it honestly is silly why its not that strong to begin with
what I meant is more light world
cus I mean - the damage output of master sword doesnt have altered values against anything
yea there's double damage for those I guess
what I moreso dont get is why the master sword is so weak outside the twili realm
when its the bane of evil
it cant be that worn out
It's been hundreds of years since Fi been at full power
@Rgamer0 fi clearly needs to yell more about batteries
She needs to recharge her batteries
oh god... is there still a key on agitha
that bug was from HC, right?
but I wanna say either PoT or HC
I SWEAR if both HC smalls are in ToT
cus I still dont know if you need to do cat game ornot
cant have been anything good then
fingers crossed its not a small key model honestly
cus like - man that would be silly
man, out of context the sentence "showing someone a rod" sounds nasty
papeHands no 3rd bomb bag for us
if this game was a more dense game locations wise for items
I'd possibly agree with that sentiment to a degree
like - sure you got trove areas like lake hylia
but then you got losse goose areas with nothing on them like eldin field
as said, will stay by it
if this was denser in items? maybe
but its not at this moment
for that static freestandings as an example would have to be part of it imo
or if it was a race seed
and keyshuffle seeds are not that commonly raced generally, given the state of key logic to dungeon density tied to them
surely treasure room has the remaining everything for hundo
this is going to be a marathon YT video
can we see the emptiness of the tracker? KEKW
5hrs or something like that yea
2 hours in for the first sword
And left with that sword for another 2 hours
I love how I even went into the tracker to paste the macro for it KEKW
I liked the pain you experienced
I would say you should limit it to like 1 or 2 max a month of this though - like - this is a long haul marathon sorta thing
Small Key (Temple of time) ?
you did not have that one i dont think?
okay where was the other one then
so it was literally go mode locked
so it gave 3 souls and a heart container
and the othr poe souls musta then been inside of ToT
And a pumpkin for some soup
Dump the souls in for some spice
as for my silly brain thought: this type of length solo rando feels like it should be a 1time a month, at most 2 a month really
If OoT Link can drink souls to mixed effects, his descendant can too
cus its hugely exhausting from the playing side
@Rgamer0 TP link does that with chuchu jelly
It's a fun experience to do a longsanity once in a while for torment seeds
ChuChu jelly is tame compared to drinking SOULS
until purple chu jelly eats 18 hearts
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
bday100 bday100 bday100 Let’s GOOOO Mario Party! 🎉
I’m interested in seeing how this goes 👀
this music is nostalgic af. brings back the anger in me LOL
I forgot you were streaming today LUL
i just realize today i need to get the new version of ap  NotLikeThis
no i am out of day
haven't did a mw since june? or maybe it was may
BASED MARIO PARTY MINIGAMES ISLAND CHADS WHO UP?
Making this minigame for the N64 controller was evil
I hope this isnt the switch version
i think you mash on all the crane games
Ive seen someone struggle with that for 5 minutes just because they werre playing on siwtch
you can just stay in on the edge of a corner and they cant get you lol
bag has to face the wall
so we racing this drunk next sgdq?
what were you playing when it broke lmao
idr any other spinning games lol
Its looking like everyone is gonna be making shorter seeds for AP so we can do them together
yeah, honestly I was getting bored of the async formula and everyone was down for it
gonna use all key rings that should speed it up for me
my emerald will jsut be key iitems and berries. While berries does add 88 checks they are on the faster side
youll have to enter a menu
i think the settings i use for oot is 426 checks and its only ever slow since i always get locked behind keys
mine will be around 360 checks
oh axl are we doing only stay in logic or can i cheat if i get bk
would you be interesed in the competitive stadium 2 mod?
oooh gl on the Stadium 2 phanto274GL
TAKEN DOWN ON THE WORD GO
i could never beat this game as a kid was too hard
think i got to the 3rd e4 and never got pass it
guessing since it raining thunder always hit
The announcer seems shocked about skiploom lol
only if you had quick attack Sadge
“hey! what was that for?” uh… this is a BATTLE, Misty.
Mega drain is slow as shit KEKW
They're all the same shit in this game
my favorite thing about stadium is the pokemon doing their get-up animation while their hp is clearly 0
i think that respectfully, karen probably pegs
thief bitter bay into confuse ray
IT CORRECTED ITS STATUS USING A HELD ITEM
and however the fuck he says gyarados
Smash Remix added the PS commentator as a toggleable option
quick claw chance is 85% in this gen phantom sorry
but only when other people use it
30% of the time it works every time
wym fearow is the best cleanup sweeper?
just remembered to cancel my switch online, it ends on the 16th
I just dont ever play switch these days
when mario party drops ill pay prob just pay for a month
like what all did I even play this year? in Jan I played another code and thats all I can honestly think of
oh right, 3 chapters of ttyd
I wonder what the mario and sonic team is working on now?
It would need ice shard and for ice to have physical moves
oooh back in time before the end PogChamp
Or Vick...I didn't see the name lolz
Ah yes, ditto before the imposter ability YEP
I told you the announcer is on something xD
it seemed like the hidden power was a bug type
No the hidden power was the friends we made along the way
Is he still gonna faint though?
do you know what the average DV’s are for your own and enemy Pokémon? are they all set to 8ish? or maxed?
fair, I wasn’t sure if you knew or the notes said
gengar prob would of ohko  weezing
Now I gotta look up kadabra and miltank
Your face is showing pure disgust...
are kadabra and miltank on ao3?
For reference all the rental DV’s are the same but it seems like the enemies get a lot harder with higher DV’s and more stat experience
I think miltank is on ao3...but not kadabra
why not? he loves to spoon!
No kadabra isn't there...also wtf is that elephant xD
And it's definitely NOT a dolphin
You can do it Phan...I believe you can get through it
Kadabra and miltank fusion looks depressing....
That is crazy it's only 79
Goes to show how much stat xp and DV help they get
0... classifies as less than 57
Oh it has a focus sash....
Slapped and killed it with a spoon
I know, that wasn't introduced until gen 4 or 5 I think, still funny when stuff lives on 1 LUL
Most Hispanic thing ever.  Kadabra is Hispanic
that is rude even it's only 10%
Not sure if you're saying that to me or Phan
To Phantom about the Focus Band sorry Anni
It's fine... I'm falling asleep so I just got confused lolz
But you did awesome for that setback
Better than going lower... or nowhere
gg have a good night everyone!
good night and fuck mario party
Yooo noooo 74 what in the world
i kinda want to submit all fish to this thing you sent me
when will you make an ap combining all the randos you can do and doing it solo?
ok this is insane but in a non cursed way
what do you call an angry kirby?
isn't that where kirby usually ends up at the end of most games anyway
i want to see the tracker
Oh never seen there were skin models on ladx baseg
Not a sword but still sharp
He's selling 50 rupees against 200 and he's proud of himself BunnyPog
I didn't noticed there wasn't hinox here lmao
can fire rod hurt the worm?
what the FUCK is a kilometer
so if you're kirby here, does that make the kirby npc in d7 link?
I had to make this on my alt cause chrome wasn't having it
guys, they ruined the Twitch app. they turned it into tiktok
it now looks like the tiktok fyp
they literally released this update today
Yea mostly runs. Had some good ones today
Kirbo can now return home to his tower
If you feel useless today, just remember somebody is working as a lifeguard at the Olympics KEKW
this is clearly Kirby's Dreamland Kappa
Whaaaaat are you up to Phan? evo17Hiyo
Omg I didn't even notice phanto274ColonD
They just announced the new format for pokemon
They banned all paradox and legendary, not just restricted it's all of em
I hope they never do again!
Everything comes back in jan though
Sep 1 to jan 5th is this reg
Hey Raven? Did they ban the best pokemon?
I would say no but I genuinely dont know if bidoof is in sv or not
I finished the pokedex I just dont remember
It's a joke reference regarding Dorkly...bidoof is just meh
Egg jammed out so hard it cracked and created a door on itself
Kirbo's nightmare huh, that was the title of a video game back in the day
Ganon shouldn't take damage from a fighter sword
The one change in the remake that I didn't like
The remake nerfed the boomerang to not OHKO Detheye
We drawing kanji up in this mf
Wow your hair is long. I'm jealous
Where the hell did that second log come from?? Link was just floating on one
Who says you can't have fun twice?
Oh hey... any updates on the sticker set? phanto274ColonD
Sorry for asking a lot... just don't wanna miss it. They looked awesome
Can always have this time as a podcast moment
Rather not see you get so angry again lolz
Personally...I think you're a masochist no offense lolz
Can take that chill moment understandable
How about a tamer version of LA rando
did you see midna was added to wind wakerr HD rando?
ah man, I missed the end, gg! phanto274GG
Look you play Sea of Stars music
Can't believe they show up on iOS but not Android
what did you post in #rando? I need context
Ice said it looks like Kanji lolz
also mother3 has a patch like that too
id be down for watching crystal legacy
Axl your face is a crystal legacy
I played a little crystal legacy, it was pretty good from what I had
I started yellow lagacy and really liked what I saw
I think you have the option to do hardmode or regular too
amish, im so looking forward to emerald legacy
Emerald legacy does look pretty hype
@Amishman19 there is an early mod you can play that as I understand it only has the treecko changes
My god it's so cute evo17Heart evo17Heart
What is this game anyway? I really wanna know about the game since it's gonna be in Japanese
My heart is already broken from cuteness overload
I think they aired it on Cartoon Network ... a good bit ago now
it's like 20 years ago now, isn't it?
July 2002 *visibly ages 50 years*
I was thinking of playing this today!!
I think I'm in heaven atm
I’ve been falling asleep to Hamtaro speedruns recently
When I was younger I was SO SCARED of the Haunted Mansion
Anyone want a used pair of roller blades? Size 9 or 9.5 in womens...size 7.5 or 8 in mens
Is it muscle memory knowing where everything is?
It looks like it's still going good though
Jeez Penelope that's like Maggie shooting Mr burns
the run never went into the read after area 2
very good run. i am free
i have been allowed to leave the mansion
this game's music is pretty decent
I left for the sake of needing to clean and I missed so much
Hamtaro wasn't exactly a "high detail" kinda show
I gotta find it so I can watch it lolz
that's cool. There's def some nice looking GBC titles
Gonna go bed... today wasn't all that good
Love juice lookin a little green…
I found a liquor that sells 4lokos
MVD said the EXACT same thing
in my defense, most 7-11's in my area, I haven't seen them
imagine phantom actually using a slingshot LUL
was just thinking how cool it would be if surge of powerr made it into taiko LUL
so i can redeem another link awakening rando like that right Kappa
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
how do you learn so many game
ive never played it but i love this game
Hey all no audio and no video. At the tail end of vacay. Hope everyone has been having a great summer so far. And awesome good to know ur doing my fave megaman styled game. Team Shadow ground style. But bug style is awsm looking as well.
Wow, that's the 1st ! Such an old but nice game ^^
my taiko drum arrived early today, really enjoy the library. Even has pokemon and digimon OPs
banging a drum to one piece is too funny to me LUL
kinda disappointed we didnt get all the one piece songs tho, Japan got more
it comes down to licensing, i get it
did you finish your notes or is the end just wing it?
I find it funny how the anime had to match the lip flaps so they call mini bomb "mini boomer"
why is paper mario 101% highlighted in red
is that the only long run you have then
star force 3 is a long run too Kappa
60k seems like so little to make you do a 6 hour run lol
my blackout bingo redeem is 50k and people have redeemed it multiple times weedMario
you use wii pro for this?
blackout bingo is kinda cool though at least
is this a wii vc game
i tried it but didnt like it so I went back to my snes controller for bn
beside feli, this was on wiiU only
i have a turn on mic redeem for 1 million point but i dont even have mic
i think im at 1.6 mil in jokehows stream
its all in the tube though
I know ive spent a lot in here between the rando seeds, VIP, and LM
sorry but bn1 loses my attention before it ends
for link awakening  when its say Entrance Randomizer: Wild+ • Shuffle Annoying Entrances • Shuffle Water Entrances does that mean just dungeon er is ok or does it mean no er?
I love watching blind people look for this dumb kid LUL
"jack in behind Yuri for a POWER-UP" KEKW
I'll jack in front of you for a power up axl
okay, thats the first thursday race ive seen. It got 6 people
oh i just reread it...looks like it said training race
when do you think you'll be done? we going to KBBQ in an hour or so if you wanna come
doing this run have you found anything you want to adjust in your notes?
I slept for like 12 hours today and I'm tired now
I slept for 4, called in to work, and then died for 8
I am no longer throwing up at least
did you get any of the bn vinyls?
@MVD731 Literally just said I did smh
did u have fun with amogus jesse
imagine not having the internet memorized
Omg mobile twitch update is God awful
it’s brutal, just saw it tuning in now
at least I figured out how to see the list of people still
When are you racing ice in bn1?
Tomorrow my sister and niece are coimg over to play taiko but they don't know about it LUL

Phantom going back to the roots. Battle Network Gaming.
Aren't the roots technically paper mario
Not everyone gets to have Paper Mario as their roots.
Phantom failed their pape license test smh
driving to work rn but gl
at least the battle music is a super banger
It's ok, I have barely any true single segment BN1 runs LUL
does ss mean no sq resets to manip?
oh, a battle network speed run? having fun with it?
well at least its not 100 zenny...
woulda been a bit funny if you got a guard chip
Are you aware of Button strats in Traffic Comp 5 btw?
You just press R and your step counter resets LUL
Understandable, the game basically just won't let you jack out so pressing R resets your step counter
Only works in Traffic Comp 5 specifically
ty. hope everybody is doing well.
ah i rember this stage... nice chips here
I’ve actually never played these games.
lets hope your battery holds out... the mini game is not that fun...
in everyone’s opinion, what is the best mega man battle network is it the first one?
I was thinking about getting some of them.
I actually saw it on the PS five store. I’ll check it out again.
thnx for the reminder. I remember seeing them on there, but I didn’t actually like click them to see what it was.
numb is such a bad status in BN1
Uhh, no. Just because I think Jugoomba or the JP community created it, and idk what resources they've made
He's usually pretty chill, he just uses DeepL to translate messages
He sent me a nice Google Sheets that was in all Japanese for the BN SS manip stuff LUL, using DeepL to translate it worked fine
Yep, that and talking to the Skull doors
i recently bought a gameboy (to start a retro collection) and i bought this game with it
i'm at the part where you can (finally) use the metroline and buy from the chip shop
This is Mega Man Battle Network
I legit don't remember what symbols to look for LUL
... ah the timebomb chip one of my favorates
welp. thats a statement there phantomgamesbot.
i see lan’s getting a head start
the "fat bully" has a gamecube
well I wont be able to play mario kart this weekend lol
Ootmm, tried to test a controller I had for emu
my sister is going to the beach this weekend and in case weather is she asked if they could borrow some games. So I lent here mario kart, party superr stars, and kirby return to dream, plus controllers and my brother is lending them a switch.
I had them come over today to try taiko, but mario kart is more their level LUL
do you have everrything youd want from romhacking?
last night I did the english patch for donkey konga 3 just in case. I saw it had naruto songs on it from pre time skip
running this are you using the live splits notes tool?
its even worse on emu cause you have to click back on the window again
i hated that about bn2 and 5
like if I clicked on the window to scroll the notes id have to click on the emu window again or it wouldnt take any inputs
granted now I have no reason to return to emu
especially now I have a gamecube dongle that lets me remap my buttons
also I bought another dongle so one can be normal controls and the other be just for BN
when my sister asked what games she could borrow, I brought her into the office and she was surprised to see i had 85 physical games LUL
this scenario is probably one of the funniest things i’ve seen in a game tbh
i should play that one day
i have played 27 parts of it
also you should morp they are fun
I thought you were gonna say "the talk to everyone" scenario LUL
in bn2 you only do it in the square
bn5 you do it during every vision burst
you know what wasnt cool tho?
have to go all the way to drill comps for vision burst LUL
I did few runs, enjoyed it enough for a few sub 5 runs but had no interest in "trying to get gud"
I played it on a phone with a normal controller. Made for a nice one and done
OSS lights the invis paths here and batteries have infinite charge
have you heard about any progress in pape multiplayer?
have you seen the glitch where protoman just kills himself?
every panel he moves to he just takes damage lol
LUL I walked away in the middle of FireMan V2, and was wondering why you were fighting him still
If you die, it's just an Any% run rischJAM
The run to Bomb man is honestly terrifying
My brain is still wired to be like "well, I can maybe get a chip here"
Hey phantom, gl on the run
Dude, those bombs were awful LUL
Funnily enough, you probably manipped to have the exact same draw :)
Bomberman players having a field with this fight
This fight is kinda miserable tbh
But at least he's not MagicMan
One of the few times  he appears, it might be important LUL
The only fear is there is a couple fights in WWW Comp 1 that can potentially kill you if no escape draw
yeah you could do worse tbh
i say as i may or may not play in the gless race tomorrow if it happens
Shitty thing is the most that Capcom has done with Mega Man recently is their card game Teppen
Time to go to the child timeline equivalent of ALTTP
I affectionately like to call this the wisdom branch of the timelines
Downfall timeline is the timeline of power and the hero is missing timeline is the timeline of courage because of exploration
Downfall being the timeline of power because it's where Ganondork won and became Ganon and its his piece of the triforce
i was lurking how did the run go?
I dont remember what this one is waynerHmm
Do you know why Auro's memo stays in your inventory when Ashei's sketch doesn't?
What a complex path to rang
Do you think this will be a full clear?
Hunt for my dommy roddy mommy
What is your tactic for beating Ganon in a quick/easy way?
I do know how to fight darknuts
Thank you, the swordfight is the only phase I consistantly struggle with
Found a new strat in ToT and it threw me off so much I had to quit my seed lol
The moving walls room with the Dynalfos can be done with just Clawshot. You don't actually need a Bow
It is just somewhat precise positioning where you stand, but it is pretty free
Yeah I posted how you can do the first half of the moving walls with just bombs as well
So I think you only need a bow for the boss
Do you know where it is or just guessing?
Yeah that is a starting hint only
Only hints you can find out and about are Path and Barren
It can be 1 of 3 options: barren bug gender, barren category like purple mist, or NumItemInDungeons (rang or claw)
Yeah priority for dungeons, but max 1 dungeon hinted barren
I wrote a giant hints explanation doc which is linked from the S1 doc
Like 14 or 15 pages long lol
That's like half of Hyrule Field lol
That's something I want to time
Yeah when you are headed to the boss from there
Forgot that BKsanity often speeds things up
Maybe once we update Ooccoo it can be a possibility
I think for TPR specifically it makes a lot of sense since we don't have that many items
I feel like we don't have many compared to OoT
I want to enter the WWR beginner tournament if I ever have time (which is never going to happen lol)
To me it seems like the easiest 3D zelda one to get into by far
I feel like TPR honestly has a really high ceiling
There is just a stupid amount of stuff you can learn lol
if it all dungeons rando oot need bombs longshot bow light arrow boomerang mirror shield hover boots iron boots dins magic hammer silver gauntlets Zelda  lullaby and lens and more depending on what settings
A sword, irons, several bomb bags, memo, lamp, spinner, clawshot, Dom rod, boomerang, hylian shield, fishing rods
That was your overworld this seed
the lag is so bad on pape
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
it doesn't feel like almost 2 years that's wild to me lol
was there a new update with this or was that just a stable thing?
oh nice, you going to join it?
oh that's fun. randomizer tourneys are so fun to watch lol, it's so much more potentially volatile i feel like
accidentally almost at a 100 hours on baldur's gate 3 oops
hows the turn out for this one?
interesting, roopa is doing resident evil 2 remake for our multiworld today
didnt know there was an m rated discord
i need to try that whenever i get a new controller
oh right, i forgot roopa was here LUL
trying to finish food before we start lol
go catch em like in animal crossing tsodinSmug
but you can sell it for free bells
i actually starting with the temple of time warp song for once
for emerald doing some different settings, legend hunt but groudon, kyorge, and latios are excluded letting me skip pokemon league
hello there, I am a dead but proud owner of a delicious in dungeon(tm) branded wooden spoon now
who needs a yaoi paddle if we got a DnD spoon
sounds like one the bot would generrate
I can slap people with it
why cant R be mapped to roll like a certain other zelda game
because tp had to be weird and special
it would be an improvement tho LUL
I had the Wii version of the game but the official guide was based on the GC
I look back at the wii version fondly
but no going back to it now
is this in logic without lantern?
I think a 7 star partners usable would make for an interesting restream race cause everyone could split up
tot hint would been nice earlier lol
just got a random gift sub to someone I never head of, check their stream. Oh its this birthday, that makes sense now
but you can pet the goat afterwards!
when subs in chat are strongly saturated, twitch starts gifting to randos to get them to check out new streams
which one of the mods is such a hoyoverse fan that the emotes for ass and head etc are in here
I just got here. gl fam!
gnight, gl on the rest of the run phanto274Sleep
look, those keese are just trying to say "ice to meet you" ohheyi30Hehe
yeah, they may be trying to murder you, but they're just showing you love PrideLaugh
oh no, I didn't know that! wait, is that normal or a rando thing only?
thats insane i had no idea KEKW
I'm guessing it's the only armor you have right now?
can't go wrong with chez PrideUwu
that would suck if Link was lactose intolerant and he ate it during the game LOL
awwhh you don't have uwah PrideLaugh
but yeah it's what we do for Ellie the elephant in Curtis' runs
the lady was wiggling like that there PrideLaugh
I really need to play this game again. i haven't played this since 08 and playing on GC would be a nice experience this time around
me too actually. Im not very good at zelda games but i played this one alot as a kiod
This was like one of my favs. It's what I wished OOT was originally like PrideLaugh
like everything I had felt was missing from OOT is in this game so it satisfies me more
plus it's more darker and grimy I feel, so that's definitely nice PrideLaugh
Nice random lantern hint in SPR
I think of LBT immediately, but wasn't that since it was IB
stalfos grotto is statistically a better chance tbh
I think thats what put me behind too lol
personally from last month to this month i went from 6-8 hours to 2:18 as a pb, so I cant be too mad
didnt expect to win, just wanted to not lose by hours lmao
aurus memo only had like a sword behind it, but you had a faster one in north eldin
Im struggling to hit a sub 2
Sub 2 is only possible on certain seeds
TBF I think most people chose wrong in this seed
yeah thats one good thing about races
The last time kariossa beat me, I was like never could have won that one. They just skipped every hint sign and won anyway lol
wish there was more races I could join lol
I may or may not do that on purpose
actively hampering my ability to improve
But idk if I am going to enter the actual tournament
Depends on if we have enough volunteers
the problem for me is my vods dont publish automatically anymore
so I have to go and do that or I forget
I can't get 1st purely on execution, so I don't want people stealing my ideas that easily
At least routing ideas. I will gladly make 3 hours videos to tell you a bunch of tricks though
idk, its less stealing ideas and more like
how am I supposed to get better if everyone actively goes out of their way to make sure you cant
I only got good fast cuz of your resources isaac
I think most people have VODs enabled. You can watch Ryuja for example
I dont think I routed that seed bad though tbh
I think i played fine, I just did too much unecessary stuff
me when you gotta stand all the way back but it doesn't trigger until you're too close
btw isaac, would I be able to ask about something in dms
You can ask, but no promises
actually, I dont know if I want to
cuz I feel like it might be rude or dramaish
If I have done something wrong, I would rather know about it. But we don't need to keep talking about it here
Also just straight up "AG not barren for once?" lol
petition to remove poes from the pool
Hello. How long will this take, 5 hours?
it would take 5 if it was full sanity Kappa
full sanity taking 5 hours would be a blessing
you know if oocoos were multiple and you could put them in all the dungeons dipping dungeons would be pretty lit
dipping dungeons in this game feels bad unless its one you can tp to the entrance
cuz if you cant clear it you get to waste time going back
I did use him that seed we played
ran into TOT, got the barren hint, dropped him and left
I love dipping CitS for the east wing
If you have an Ooccoo, you can dip into CitS before warping back to the dungeon you actually want to go back to
And also a lot of time to save
The one with all of the peahats
Right now I do reverse every time because it is way easier
I see a sword here so often lol
trying to figure out if I should do another seed or if I should chill tonight
who wants to make my bad decision for me
its more the fact I did 4 seeds last night in a row
I would not overdo it then lol
and then the weekly today as soon as I woke up lmao
Ive played like 20 seeds in 1 week
That was me testing before the dev release
I think its why I get burned out fast but I also get good pretty fast too
drehan settings were kinda unfun to me
s1 blossom settings are super fun
o/ dont p in your t
I dropped from the tourney because of unenforceable bans
And also 3 sky chars for CitS if really not fun
on the upside for me, I nailed all the wolf jumps
so I atleast got all those down
I didnt even get to do the kak one cuz bombs got handed to me instantly
Kak one is worth doing 100% of the time I think
I full cleared it cuz I didn't have enough items to justify it
How's this one going so far?
Yeah deku toad is one I have thought about skipping
I feel like risks make more sense in a 1v1
@isaac_twpr I just used the chicken cuz I was up there getting the hint and I already checked the bomb stuff in kak
though I think in the future I'll just do the jump anyway
I think there is a specific spot you can stand as well, but I haven't put a lot of time into it
Im very good at the summo minigame
Did you see my videos in glitched-discussion for ToT?
I think actually im gonna catch up on the sleep i lost to wake up for the race, ggs on the race and good luck with the seed
I just realized im hella tired lol
when will you do a full entrance dungeon boss shuffle?
For this one, you can just walk over there and put a bomb down
For the 2nd one, you stand perpendicular to the wall and up against and centered
Then hold L, throw 3 bombs with X and then run
I think you're done for now
Oh I really need to time stuff here as well
Maybe you'll get lucky and find a clawshot
That sign location actually kinda nice when you don't have clawshot or DDR
Oh yeah sometimes I don't do the clip for that reason
Time to engage the backwards thrusters
Oh did you see my poe 1 skip setup?
I have done it like 50+ times in a row at this point lol
It got lost like twice. Yeah it's in the discord. Or you can go to isaac_twpr on YouTube
At least you have a good sword
It could be bows behind IB
Sometimes your gut is wrong lolz
It can't be a bow since that part is bow-locked
i always forget to see if youre live until im already watching recordings on youtube lol
Your relationship with stallord is so clearly love hate
Oh you can proceed in ToT
Aww I got noodle juice on my phone
I'd go for tot personally but you do have a point
Can we go 3/3 bows in LBT
That'd be a big ol coinkidink for 3/3 bow
Btw you can jump from the lower platform to grab that switch
Nah because you mightve missed sounds
Back in my day the coral earring scared us, and we liked it
Oh it could be the fishing rod if that was this side
At this point... why even need the boomerang?
Oh right the room with... the fucking candle
Yeah I think it has problems conceptually
Imagine FT, GM, LBT. You need barely anything
Woah woah when did you get a new best??
so I ended up not sleeping
when will the generator website get a cosmetics file
I'll mainly be focusing on structural stuff for 1.3
But we should be able to have a seedbot in racetime
I am basically rewriting the website for 1.3, so I don't want to do much before that and have to redo it
I just closed it and opened it and the whole thing is clearer and louder...wtf twitch
I worked on it for 2 months straight last year
I hold that one at gun point and start screaming "if you swing we both gonna die"
We also have the basic framework for a local offline generator, but I'm going to split that into multiple releases
It's too much to try to do it all at the same time
Well it would be in addition to the website. Basically a copy of the website you can run locally
would that mean it doesn't go down when the website goes down but also doesn't update either
Bow is better when it comes to the spiders
so would be allot like what ootr has
I dont think mmr even has a website version
But the offline part won't be 1.3
either discord bot or the generator
I don't think WWR does either
wwr has the best tracker ever instead
i use the command line to make seeds for mmr
My goal has been to do at least as good as OoT and hopefully better
more accurately i made a script to just generate seeds for me
for what its worth I think you're already doing fantastic
not doing the glitchless skip for that
I feel bad for that one person in the race
you can get on top of the fence with clawshot and then jump slash over
their comment was "the hints could be clearer I was mislead :( "
theres like a target on the ceiling for some reason
I wonder what hint was confusing
I was wondering if it was the bomb path one, but idk
maybe got confused by the irons
technically it was bomb locked though, cuz ball and chain was also bomb locked
Yeah it just means logically you won't find B until you have already found an A
me when I accidently fall in lava with zora armor on and die instantly
never, lets get rnged by gohma forever
is it a % chance for it to stop
I just looked up the ZSR race I was in and it was 35s
Id surmise its probably around 30-50%
It cant be higher than 50% cuz theres no way it moves around for 35 seconds 70% chance
you'd have to be really lucky
I think the only thing i struggle on most seeds now is deducing what to skip and what not to towards the end
cuz I dont fully know the logical spheres yet
so I dont know if something is deep or not
"WOW LADY YOUR WAY TO CLOSE PEPERSPRAYYYY"
Also why does she take 3s to start talking
to shame you for rolling too close to her
goron kid starts crying when you talk to him
well achtually the last big item was master sword nerdCheck
hes learning how to speed run
Either that or got the vibrator on too high and can't move
my favorite enemies are the worms in the desert when they just fly off the side into a hole
If it's here I'm gonna be so disappointed
let me shoot fire at it
Hylian shield kind of looks worse on Link to me now
I think the ordon shield looks cooler
but you know, if I press block on accident against any fire element bye bye
Oh yeah wooden shield is rough lol
Find no bugs until you go to Agitha
"what if we give the player a hint, and it leads to two dominion rods...but they're bait MaxLOL "
so is the pig faster or is wolf faster
it feels like wolf is faster cuz more control
Wolf is better for that reason
I did tests a long time ago
Didn't you said you got the first claw in desert?
where was the dominion rods at
Watch Agatha not give the boomerang
kinda wanna see if you get all 20 hearts. (you won't but let a birb dream)
dont let your memes be dreams
That one bug in the very hot place was the rang
And it ain't a desert which was a ball and chain
I don't wish 20 heart seeds on anyone actually tbh
The rain is the appropriate mood of this seed
Oh quiet you...I forgot it existed lolz
damn did link install the new hylian LEDS in that shit
me when I get pissed on the highway
You need it back in the lobby as well
Making cube for dog...imma take a pic before I finish the sew lolz it's huge
Ganon felt like being extra today
dang u've gotten really good at TP huh
Why you didnt use the ball and chain to kill the darknuts
Pressing the funnee button on Pape....
That's why I try so hard for consistency in my setups
they only become worth it if the speedrun you're in is at wr level and the competition is literal seconds lmao
I never get sick of Ganon laughing and then going serious mode here
like mario 64, I see why they go for like a 6 frame time save
their competing for frames over there
there might be a race happening soon as well
This was terrible, need to delete this with a fresh new seed stock
I'll probably join if it happens
the seed was a messy, but ok
spacerawk asked if anyone wanted to join them and someone else
I dont know if they are actually gonna do the race though
you could play Celeste for an hour /j
If you've never done Celeste as a speedrun you aren't getting it in an hour I guarantee you that much
but Phantom's cracked so who knows
True, and no guarantee it actually happens
I mostly say it to be a menace and spread the Celeste propaganda
Why does everyone have to start at the exact same time if people have timers..?
Or am I just stupid lolz
for the drama, I assume. specifically for people watchin peeking in at different places
I thought you had the holy trinity
AG SPR CitS is the unholy trinity
I was there for that seed
CitS that forces you to go to the right and SPR that doesn't tell you boss key is on the dumbest possible check
who could have seen that coming
I sense a bit of sarcasm but I could be wrong
I once saw GM path to Fyrus
All 3 bows were in LBT
the downside to skipping the barren zd
every time I have seen "this is a sword(skippable), I literally cannot find the 4th sword
so I waste time when I coulda just did the dumb check and got the sword I know about
Funny thing about that hint is for these settings, wallets are not even logical items
Which is why it didn't say (not useful)
Their only purpose is for the Magic Armor check currently
Since donations don't require big wallets
Oh lol. That is really obscure logic
Oh yeah wasn't cave of ordeals required
It probably won't start for another 25 minutes
We got 5 people in there right now
Judging by the almost 30 mins that passed and items...
Wait...rang but no sword or shield...hmm
which option do you want to do phanrom
hey phantom o/ good luck on the rando MindManners
i was playing Wii Sports spin control blindfolded lol
Looks like it's 3 on continue
took me 8 hours but i finally got it lol
spin control is a training game, has all the barriers and stuff
but yeah, it's been a while since my paper mario rando days lol
Yeah but like...did you hit anything?
4 say keep going...2 say go to race
anyways i gtg eat, good luck on the rando again and have fun with stream! MindManners
Gonna go get set up o7
Is there something in your nintendont settings that have you like...save and it exits on its own?
The beginning was pure poverty and we passed by money value early
Oohh that's cool and useful phanto274ColonD
I still gotta know though...is it a bow?
Sorry I for some reason really liked that moment
This seed is starting to look pretty decent despite the sketch start
I honestly think if it starts off too good...it'll end up shitty
So this may be a good seed :3
Honestly clawshots might be the shitty part of this seed
Was gonna say what if claw was in mines lolz
Swords are more of a pain than anything else because of the running to each spot
Because half of the bugs are already ded
Okay its bad that idr acknowledging that at least we got something...I really don't remember
Jesus christ you've gotta be kidding me
Rain says it's the stress mixed with sleep deprivation
Would be great if claw was in mist
You already checked the other cave?
Puts a whole new meaning to swordfishing
Or angry... whichever comes first lolz
I meant cam you throw a bomb on the button?
And we still have that path to morpheel here too
would be so much better to skip miniboss if you already had bow
cant even see them properly xD
oh now they are ok visible xzd
i just finished playing corpse party 1 xD
it was using my only braincell left xD
Star 2 would be a hell of a place for the lakebed stuff
Seems like you're having a blast
It would be funny if it's Zora Armor
What a roundabout path, paper for paper
Maybe what you need to do is roll the two seeds at least 6 hours apart from each other
Not time of day, but rather higher chances of 2 bad seeds consecutively and to force a different RNG roll
Yeah it was hard locked in lantern cave behind lantern the moment you left the ToT after getting MS
i had you on low is this the seed where both rods lock clawshot
yeah we was big chilling in there
my dumbass put ganon boss key on dungeon and not dungeons i beat the req amount and was like HUH where my boss key
I had a big pop off, you need both wailord and relicanth for sealed chamber. I went into magma base not repelling hoping to find one and I found wailord in there LUL Then taking the sealed chamber hint I found the other in stevens room
Diababa can stay in their hole
can sit here for a bit before bed...watching you end ganon is fun
232 is the most tbh...unless zelda throws bs and horseback mistakes
i mean he's right ya know
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
as long as you keep playing...this isn't the end lolz
@blacktiger51 how are you always here so fast
i just click my mouse really fast i guess
Hey! I been watching your content on youtube for months now, figured I'd finally catch you live!
my gf just told me my last name means walrus in french
You're too generous, you should make it 100$ to join
Seeds 4-6 look cool, coinsanity during a race
potentially get a seed where you can use exactly nothing
Blitz rules would be safe at least
Watt is a bit bowish in color
what is a feesh doing with shoes
yeah you see there 1 issue with that
i wonder when ap will get dungeon er for this
we just got star beam shuffle for ap the other day
All 7 chapters for a race seems like a lot
Hey are you still playing Kart with subs?
Weird...figured people would when it comes to Mario Kart lolz
"Mario, you can breathe underwater right?"
i can see a final with 3 attack watt and only super boots
The rando chose Tank Mario today
Dammit autocorrect...I didn't need an s
No it was just my phone
also dont ask me why, but I decided to SMS bonus set on Retroachievements
which has stuff like infinite fluttering for 4 minutes straight to eat a fruit 🙃
it is fun once you can do it
on basically SMG2 style input chains per flutter
and then the timing being more Yoshis island where you go early, but in 30 fps
sooo its not lenient at all and the way to do it is rough
but (if you were to be a runner of SMS which I never was or will be) there's a bunch of silly things you can easily get behind
like say, PIanta 3 "go in a line with wind" to give an example
tight? sure. easy to do? once you know how? yap
sometimes i wish paper was real
dangit, that was more meant overall
my brain is definitely awake and nod halfway tired cus of silly bogus
volcano just happens super easy early most of the time
and then relatively speaking while all the chapters have a somewhat equal ish key item count needed to complete, some of that is partners for some chapters, which then not only are that but also double down as combat overall
or more cross chapter versatility / usability
which arguably, the shuffled dungeons mix up enough so that 7 chapters isnt "oh look we're in chapter 5 within 40minutes!"
like - to me, thats a definite "shake up positive" sort of setting in just allowing for more diverse things to happen in a way
well that sounds not quite comparable KEKW
I guess my POV in terms of how comparable settings are is moreso not just single rando but "how much length can this add potentially" if that makes sense
I mean - whats the holdback to it really?
so rn its "just" not tied to logic as to how your dungeons land
meaning if you were to 4chapter seeds, you could still need to visit all 7 regions
it doesnt take the "now present / new" dungeon of ch1 but what originally was
a submutation of "blitz"-oriented be it toggle or change, whichever gets chosen if any, where required chapter = dungeon + region line up
so say, silly example given you just gave one (my brain just didnt parse it): 6 dungeons, you shuffle them by iteration as example (could roll) being 1 -> 2 and so on til 6 -> 1
6 being at 1's region would count as part of region 1
v how its happening here, region 1 then gets pulled apart but stays region 1 alltogether
which is the big bone in potential blitz style settings with dungeon shuffle as it can easily create nonsense where you need further items just to open up the routes to the things
not to mention a potential grey area on where items can / cant land
cus as much as it might be hard determinable if you know the code - outside of racing, ^ described grey area from a casual POV can come up and lead to "oh well, time to full clear everything even more"
I think worse then a mistake like that to me sounds to be if you got 2 split paths with progression, 1 immediate and chaining to the other, the other "just existing" if that makes sense
basically a "rando be rando" thing which then would decide the race
which that scenario would sting especially on ch4/5 dungeons
cus those are also troves of stuff if you get good access to them
and it would be a SUPER rough sell to pass that up early
wym? good acccess or value in there?
does make sense on 4chapter seeds
thinkin if you got all 7 moreso there
cus thats more where that sorta routing difference could fall into playing a role I feel like
like how the more stuff you have to commit to in MM or OoT, the more respectively each small routing choice leading to nothing bites you that much more when the other person just ended up on a better path of prog in routing
to me truth be told, rando races are mostly interesting (watching / casual playing) if you got those puzzly bits, BUT from a "play this" POV definitely cant say it would be a fun player experience
truth be told, all of us that did Randos were told to recruit new people :)
aside of that: rando is fun
oh wait, you did them too Jon?
but I did play a decent share of MMR, OoTR (latter more casually)
then with archipelago, I messed with a good chunk of other randos
for Pape I think I played like 4 or 5 seeds?
I think that's why I got so burnt out
and the last I did was basically "just" all chapters without gear shuffle cus not available
I put maybe 500 hrs into randos? I can't remember
somewhere between 300-500. I know that much
definitely did more on just randos myself (not just 1 game though, as described earlier)
I like messing with many randos rather then stickin w 1 tippiTap
if you go faster this seed will be over!
i totally didnt do a run of it today
how do marKart runs even work
normal w/out dlc takes like 1.5-2 hours, w/ DLC is like 3-4
is it literally double track count?
it goes from 48 to 96
did a race with levias and rigby, blitz preset but 7 spirits and partners always usable
for a racing game, thats a long span of pure attention + execution needed
so what are you looking for phantom, flower level stuff?
I think having more routes open could make races more interesting
I think your bot is revolting
How far are you into the rando?
Lolz sorry to hear man...I'm pretty sure everything will speed up soon
So you're at go mode but it'll take a while?
Kinda sure it's this one you don't like
damn lolz those poor mini clouds get eaten for health
One day it will be updated
yeah me too KEKW no one ever use it
What are general league settings outta curiosity? 7 star I take it? what else of it
on laptop...number of secs behind lolz
when you l on the p to 7 scale
our dasher's name is mario omg
I just got back from anime convention
From walking all day in cosplay
simply jump on him until he's dead
I saw some pm64 merch and ttyd stuff in the artist alley, sticker sheets
I didn’t get them, no use/place to put stickers
is that just cause requiring all 7 stars or are there other issues with it?
@luey_gaming_guy hey I don't know if you're still here, but thanks for the sub!! phanto274ColonD phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Doot
I dont think I've played or watched this game since the 1 time we played at like
Woah wait, I've never seen this course either
No problem @CRUISECONTROL4COOL  I've been watching so much of Phantom on yt I wanted to show some support
ill play blobComfy after im done with toontown rq
So close yet so far lolz
Yeah... that lightning was wtf why xD
I never liked that stage lolz
do the gaping holes not count
no but wtf was that course
i have never seen it lmfao
Karma...threw three red shells only to get it done to myself xD
smh i was wondering where yall were
with different courses and everything KEKW
Son of a Donkey Kong xD
It was a oh shit rush lolz
I threw fireballs and they all missed xD
Used the triple mush thinking there was a shortcut and dashed into a bench xD
staring at peaches gyatt the entire time
i grew up on this course, aint nobody beating me on it KEKWait
hang on, left my Switch in the car
everything you own, in the box to the left
Was thinking the same buffoon lolz
ty for the games! i might join again ina sec but let me talk to bae for a sec lmao
I said "SHUT UP" when you commented about that collision from the green shell
Fell off 4 times man lolz
that was my banana you slipped on lyn
Sorry guys I gotta leave that one
Idk why but I've been spacing out in games lolz
should have that as a setting...green shells only lolz
on a track with no mushroom shortcuts or anything
I had two triples at once
like, game, what am I supposed to do with this?
I wondered why it gave me 3 reds and a star too
then I looked at the map
you had one red a star at some point, yeah?
I hate you so much phantom
not fire them with good timing
I saw you behind me with the triples and was like "ah crap all i have are trip greens and a single and there are a bunch of curves"
no way to realistically fire them backward to shield
you gotta get a good angle
i may pop in for one more after this match phanto274Lurk
Good Luck to anyone not Anni phanto274Ohoho
avoiding your spoiler but what was your time on seed 7?
This map pisses me off soooooo much
okay...that was fun. time for bed
YES. I've started a conversation in the lobby
so I still didn't end up getting that double box when I horned you
that baby penguin took a bullet for you
whomever stole my star, you're banned when I found you
half this lobby are meta O_O
Buff00n has played the same thing for 10 billion years he doesnt count
Actually this game probably has been out for 10 at this point LOL
Yea this game is over 10 years old
Daisy has been mid for 10 years and buff00n stayed loyal and now she's top 2 or w/e
3rd place getting exploded by the blue lol
oh I'm not talking about buffoon, or even phantom, because that's on brand
@RavenFP be careful who you call low tier
Be careful who you call low tier in middleschool
I know buff00ns petty ass popped off when he came back and boxed the same dude back
I saw you pull back up with one and I knew you were happy with yourself LOL
Everyone else uses tilt controls but buff00n uses spite controls
spite, rage and hate is wot DRIVES ME
no sane person likes cheese land
probably my last one then I gotta bow out
I kept getting bolted whenever I got anything
eating still, few minutes and I'll switch over
on pc and yeah you do
i made a lotad in dolphin but it desyncs
tp 6 years before tp came out
Wait dolphin is allowed for tas?
Well to be fair it's that or bizhawk lmao
but apparently not very well for mm lol
Vc games are just weird overall for how dolphin behaves
idk if i did something wrong but reloading a save state changes the rng for wii vc mm lmao
so idk if tasing on dolphin will work at all
is this when we request features KEKW
I'm on mobile, I can't see squat
how did you decided on what would be always and sometimes?
okay so thats why lantern is sometimes
that seed I rolled was god awful shrink chest > ruins key > boos portrait > crystal berry > star stone > toy train > lantern ghost red key phanto274Smile
are you consulting with isaac for like general ideas and things to be look out for?
if possible since you mentioned "auto off regions" - any way you could gen hints only after goal is formed?
just thinkin cus a) I dunno how these hints would work
and b) then if ya get it working to the extend you wish for it, being able to get the goal info into the decisions of hints so you dont say, roll a blitz seed as example, ch1 through to 4 needed, 5,6,7 not -> foolishes on ch5,6,7 regions
it has to be somewhere otherwise item placement would fuck up yea
can you gen a 6ch lcl?
so would the hints be in a log or do you have a way to implement it in game?
one idea I had is bring back the chapter title cards and display hints there
Oh hey Phantom how are you- oh that's a lot of words oranThink
what seeds are you doing today?
I dont see the point of item pouches on 4 chapters
I think it would be cool if you could force item pouchs to shops, put 1 in ch1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 shops
Id rather not use them cause its more menuing, but its fine for all sanity
have fun, ill be dodge spoilers
did you see that Kent c koopas mouth and tongue was yellow implying that all of his insides are also yellow
I like how you’re having a war over a single coin
yo it’s our child and god watt
in my head it’s very easy to imagine one of rip Cheetos items is the blue key
or just use a repel gel
the mega bloopers babies are really cute shame you have to massacre them
they’re was 6 star pieces in the right room
maybe Sargent guys hat is the bucket
How was the race last night?
considering we got vanilla tuba key it’s possible
hmm i wonder if i need to update my pape yaml since the new settings
did they use gum balls as the noses for all these snowmen
ugh i did join a ap this weekend guess have to get a new yaml SadgeBusiness
so i rolled a seed with my old yaml and it set the req star spirits to 5 KEKW
my old yaml didn't have that option at all
same thing Spirits Required for Star Way:   5
i also deleted the Goombario color on my new 1 by mistake and its still gen KEKW
it was set to Default for his color
Heyo back for some nice PM
Oh try another seed we're about to
would para be in logic for getting places
Other than giving up the ghost
just use goombario for every boss fight just for swag
I am a bit phanto274Sleep today
fire flower putting in work lmao
I misread the chapters at first :)
It certainly was an Interesting seed
honestly I would take S2 + dungeon shuffle
I did misplay a few tthings
I may have come with the raid but I do sometimes watch your runs on YT
dont do ch4 like I did KEKW
oh coinsanity, I feel like that would be interesting to see in a race
that one I could possibly get behind
I need to try it first
7 chapters seems like a through just play the whole game seed that's more fitting for a finals setting
Going to set up shop at an 18 mile long yard sale Saturday
I invited a coworker to hang out with me at it and she initially said yes but then her family made plans to go to Waldameer Park that day.
Wait I think I know what you're thinking
Going to lurk now, darlings, haven't slept well the last two nights. Don't have work tomorrow, so hoping to get restful sleep tonight.
Wouldn't you have been able to kill that turn if Power Rush was equipped?
Useless because you don't have Goombario yet right?
Jump x1 w/ Mario then Smack, Blooper was at 9, right?
Fight logic is really hard unfortunately
you want what set me off most
My last pm rando gave me 2 and that's it, lost them both before bowser :(
ohhhh I had a repel gel from ch4 accidentally I think
So uh Bombette was behind 1 ruins key, you needed bombette to get a 3rd ruins key in tubba castle, which was needed to get pyramid stone
you had to double/triple ch2 and ch3 multiple times
the bad is really bad and the good is just normal
Do you think Super-rank Sushie is likely to be better than Super Parakarry for final on average?
im guessing that setting is just on at this point though
Is Water Block that bad? Or just situational?
Squirt is slower but at my level I don't care that much lol
So if Shell Shot is cheap, it's usually optimal but if not, I assume Watt or Sushie could either be good depending on upgrades?
Which can and does happen ime, I was making that assumption implicitly ig
Farewell, you can stay with the shy guys
I forget, how much is Squirt in vanilla? I feel like it's rarely expensive but maybe I'm wrong
Yeah okay so they're generally similar BP range
Can happen especially with unused dupes that you get a bunch of cheap FP Plus but otherwise FP is often not worth investing that much
We might run into the case of the Zero upgrade Watt vs the fully upgraded Sushie
Have you been to 3 already this seed?
Why is this seed giving some deja vu?
First partners Bow and Laki, now Boots on Forest FP Plus again...
That reminds me, I learned how to do Clippy finally, wasn't hard
(I hadn't attempted before but got it like 2nd try when I did lol)
Might start including some variations in my glitch logic but we'll see
I always forget about things I can do with TT Sushie glitch...
I don't do races often but would definitely be interested if schedule permits
(And if logical glitches are within my skillset)
I do like the partner shuffle, but that check specifically sucks
just skip it every seed :)
It was meant to be a Xmas tree
I’m also a fan of the item pouches
me either, also makes double/triple dip more viable
With these settings, I think it might only remove single coins
why does everyone want my key? D:
How likely are you to actually use Charge? I feel like it isn't useful as often as one might think...
(I was typing earlier so I meant either Charge)
Funny that both Boo minigames were jump charge badges
At least we will go without upgrading Watt this seed
So RIP Zero Upgrade Watt vs Fully upgraded Sushie
can’t believe Phantom is playing paper mario blind that’s crazy
I came in to them screaming? Are you showing your luscious self to everyone again? PrideUwu
"well you see, I'm just that good looking"
I almost did another ? at the end there LOL
then you can lift me up an- I mean what? 😳
yeah, i'm close to being underweight I believe actually
I'm 5 10 and need to lose some
he does say a lot about his size to everyone curtis8Heh
I still need to do the RA set for this
it's a free 800 points lol
yeah, that's not bad at all. Honestly, it only takes a while because you gotta tattle everything and beat all the bosses
and I think you gotta do minigames too?
all the missable stuff is just the bosses I believe so that ain't too bad
oh there is? okay I'll have to recheck that list
i been looking at the vod and i don't think you found cake mix
pretty sure i know where it is tho
do you want to know where i think it was after you beat the seed?
wait, a hint system still doesn't exist?
I would definitely like a little something though PrideLaugh
i just had some leftover pizza from dinner
Agreed with that sentiment about Lettuce
its last for like 3 days lol
salad stuff I get lasts like 2-3 weeks at least 🤔
but it's not just iceberg lettuce. it's a bunch of greens
ahh yeah, romane can do that
I usually use dark greens, that's why PrideLaugh
yeah, I do like me some spinach PrideUwu I used to make a lot of drinks with it in the past
i know where the goomnut was
What a place for that weight
goomnut and supershroom was on shyguys and you never check the bush outside boo mansion
you took pipe then hit block then reverse forest
yeah i seen every check in ch4 and 6 and all shops and no cake mix
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I like how he tip toes to the snag machine being sneaky like he didn’t just bomb the place
coming out to wind demon fist you
idk whats happening here but its interesting
not for quil, just espeon? tippiTap
back in the day when these 2 pokemon could use their feet
I forgot which of them was part of manips and which wasnt
now a days they just fly
well, fingers crossed ya get that dice roll one
so frail but fast if I see this right
it has the speed and offense, and those 2 are what matters, right
who stole his looks from Ansem-posessed riku KappaPride
never noticed koffing gets possessed the moment before he’s returned
I can think of a few ways to wash them
so fun fact I accidentally ate magic mushrooms a few days ago but nothing happened
I can't believe quil is fucking deas
I’ll explain so I was hungry and in my fridge they’re was 4 bars of chocolate and I ate a piece but after eating the first bite I read the ingredients and well I think you know what was in them
so wideBurgy whats the damage quil
81 HP, 46ATK, 42DEF, 64SPAtK, 45SPDef, 53Spd
I mean - if its runnable, its runnable?
or is that now different judgement given stats needed and such
@SwiftPichu_ listen, this isnt tippis fault tippiAFirret it was just a random furret tippiSway
have you seen the SMS glitched subset on retroachievements or nah? p4ntzThink
been diggin too much into it and now I wanna complete the set PrideLaugh
problem is there's shit like 4minutes of infinite flutters tighter then SMG2 infinite flutters
which if you mess up a single set of inputs good luck, back to the start with ya
I aint got the patience for that, I am sorry HahaSweat
Oh GOD who did this to you
frame perfect rng manip on 60FPS phanto274Smile
it could be a decent game
but a very very rough speed game
Eevee's first time being the star of the show as in starter
Who knew that this would later launch the mascot status of Eevee in later generations
are you sure that wasnt already solidified as an option when the eeveelutions were first shown
Eevee was mostly known before as that mon that you got for free that had 5 evos by the time this came out
you didnt get a free eevee in either 1st or 2nd gen though? tippiThink
and 3rd gen I dont think either -
You got eevee for free in back of Celadon city for gen one
I musta thrown eevee into the "look here game corner" pile in my head then
Though you had to breed with a ditto
which I could swear it always was there
I obv. could and most likely will be wrong on that - cus I mean - I didnt play much pokemon main line
I did dabble a bit with platinum, had gen5 (think black, then white 2)
oh so THAT is how this game's pokeballs work
yes, I justnow saw that they actively gave a reason for why people can catch other people's pokemon in this
It's him.  MIROR B and his Ludocolo squad
I forgot if Pikachu wins the cutscene plays out the same anyway righht?
super late to the party but I just heard the news!!!
Oops All Goombario is a thing KEKW
got a chipped wisdom tooth pulled and been binging digimon adventure subbed
yeah theree wasnt much tooth left and bbeen putting it off in fear of getting it done
for sure, my denist had me by the balls. "If you want this crown then that tooth is coming out" phanto274Smile
and my brother is letting me take tomorrow off to feel better so thats nice too
hows this attempt feel so far?
youve seen the yin yang ping pong on steam? Feels like a good fit ffor starting soon
lileep/cradily is one of my favorite gen 3 mons
well... in gen 3 stockpile doesnt raise defense until gen 4. But still a great bulky mon
of course steven has one LUL
also weather wasnt bad here over the weekend, just lots of rain and thunder
imagine of navibug had a zenny bug, zenny drains in the custom screen LUL
megarock posted in a new bn meme, check out your #meme later
pokemon presents 8/8 6am PDT lol
Not to fight her toxic fans LUL
If only flamethrower was in this game Kappa
True. Fire Blast is just scary for me. LUL
two misses aren't too bad over the course of a entire speedrun
Every pkmn speedrunners dream. No misses, all crits,
You just wanted to check how much money you had.
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed trainers, and fellow Pokémon enthusiasts, Today, we gather here to pay our heartfelt tribute to a Pokémon that has left an indelible mark on our journey—a Suicune that, despite our best efforts, eluded capture and has now departed from our world. In the face of this loss, we find solace in the memories we shared, the battles fought, and the bond we formed, however brief it may have been. Thank you, Suicune and screw you, Phantom. Cheer100
Raikou cut your speech short. phanto274Cry
I love how Typlosion just jumps out of the ground and punches him
@ScrambledDragons For every Kabutops Mega Kick there is a Golem Mud Slap, they aren't perfect but yeah
Oh yeah, there are definitely some weird ones. But I can't help but love them. The fainting ones are some of favorite animations.
number go up and all tht
and now that twitch stopped interrupting me for that PartyHat gl with the mega man run stuff
dont know how much o this game hinges onto RNG, but gonna guess a fair bit
just getting the fight tools is 1 thing, getting the good fights where ya need small eeasy encounters is the 2nd
man I sure LOVE my chair
need to be 60 distinct unique usables
which Imma guess a fraction of needs to actually be farmed for, since "chests" exist in these areas?
yea no what I thought is that some of the universal ones ( be it say, a healing or stat up?) would be possibly just found
also did I just rest the name on the split right
yo phantom phanto274GL  how’s the run treating you?
Oh shoot this didn't show on mobile! PartyHat Happy Affiliate anniversary!
but more importantly congrats on the big one five zero zero
its banjo on outset island, its def worth a look at least
its an upgraded mod so its called deluxe. Kazooie trash talks about it being another rehash LUL
another thing, I havent touched shadow reloaded. Saw it got an update like a month ago so will prob start that soonish
I thought your atk would be 3 by this point
last night komari was talking about bn, so i finally finished my BN5 notes lol
I may add maps to them
I followed your notes layout when making it
did you know gomamon's seiyuu is naruto?
been benging it, next ep tentamon goes perfect/ultimate
adventure 01 the fights arent much. Its just evolve do 1 attack and fight over
did you watch tamers subbed or dubbed
been having trouble finding it subbed lately
i do remember as a kid really really liking tamers
now I gotta give bits to the bot phanto274Smile
I can lurk during my shift
and then when the stream is done it raids into you KEKW
hows your polar bear skip been?
one time I had a real clean style skip, made it look so free lol
I ran, paused, and got it
imagine if you could do that to all bosses
just do a full run! the only thing that matters is your leaderboard integrity!
ur also not valid until your pb is
wait is that why it's called single segment?
why didnt you pick a cooler game like pokepark wii: pikachu adventure?
speedrun both games at once and get WR in battle network + pokepark any%
i just tuned in so i missed whatever went wrong
yeah i played BN3 years ago and I got into watching some speedruns this year. I dont know too much about 1. No sneak runs like 2 i guess.
BN2 has level thresholds for running too
Which we make sure to level up too
I was planning to watch risch tonight but hes not on, so if your gonna do some runs ill stick around.
rng manipulation is what keeps me from trying to speed run any of the games xd
i think i fell asleep to a BN6 run where it was buster only and it still did crazy dmg
tbh i prefer the art style in 3 above them all xd
the japanese throws me off cause i barely know the story is this first time red haired dude shows up
ive seen the speedrun before on youtube but sometimes i fall asleep
I am so sorry your run had to die to Evice last night 😔
I'm glad it was useful otherwise but rest in pepperoni silver wid boost my behated
29 spA is all you need tbf
Oh Hardy isn't too bad either
collseium i think i didnt play. like poker stadium?
Yea that probably helped in the end with that death on linoone
@aotwking Sorta yea, imagine stadium with a more fleshed out story
There is no other pokemon run like it but it is hard as all hell
cool, i watch pchal and smallant pokemon stuff so id probably enjoy watching it
PB soon clearly (When it's redeemed again)
the background to this being a bunch of rotating "e"s is weird
i guess they could be "6"s
the games came out so fast and then just dissappeared.
I think they made improvements from 1
I dont remember much tbh. But I liked the concept of styles
do you heal to full hp after every fight in BN1?
yeah its interesting. as a kid I didnt run from battles and wasnt very good so one of the reasons game was so hard was getting to the boss to save with decent health
as a spectator watching the battles is more fun but I get it
i play poker and losing a couple 70/30's in a row isnt too uncommon
Is this like BN2 and above with placement in the folder?
two gold splits early on though
I dunno I always forget how to multiply percentages xd
is it possible to get 5 run chips?
Just seems like an RNG lose condition but what is the actual question you want? it was like 7/10 encounters no escape?
I want to eat food again phanto274Cry
so like if it was 25% chance to not draw the chip. and it happened 7 times out of 11. then its 0.637%
i dont know the odds of getting the escape chips so its hard for me to do more. I found the math formula but cant use it myself xd
i guess you were on the 3rd or 4th biome but its crazy how the encounters ramp up fast
guts man i think went good
recovery chips are less useful i guess in this one. in 3 i would get down to last enemy and cycle through my folder trying to heal xd
the triple recovery chip draw was ugly lol
i dont remember what a code means in this sense
chips you can draw and use in same custom window
BN1 is weird it doesnt unhighlight the chips you cant add. confused me an hour ago
I 100% 1 on LC, and I hated it LUL
When I found out that S rank doesn't guarantee the chip
I played 3 a ton as a kid. but I would been like I dunno 11? and I couldnt beat the game. Came back like 10 years later and beat on emulator xd
I wanted to throw myself into a volcano
Farming bomb man 3 made me want to literally die
The only BN game I 100% was BN3, but that was years ago
100% means getting every secret chip? yeesh
I got the life aura chip in this game too
Bass is legit just the black hedgehog from sonic
ive only 100% the first 3 games
in our april fools race several years ago, Numberman spawned a timebomb on top of him and he got deleted KEKW
he, it was his first time ever playing it
"WHERE DID MY ADD CHIPS GO!?!?"
next month is NT right? or did you say wonderswap?
localizers just gave up and named the cannonball virus "howitzer" KEKW
moving is weak. stoneman too strong to move
S is just busted in this game
dont worry, I wont let you forget LUL
I was disappointed as a kid seeing aqua cross in BN6, I wanted Shark Cross. That would be so badass.
fun fact, he has a mugshot in BCC
is sharkman the one that absolutely looks like a fake boss?
they were desprite to get a wood navi
name one good wood navi not tomahawk
fake like artisticly he stands out from the bosses in BN games
wood, snake, planet, plant from the first 3
yeah, he attacks with fire and aqua towers but is wood himself
bn2 had 2 navis for the 4 elements
weird how heat and napalm werre both post game
see the background of this dungeon? Why couldnt theyy do that for the actual net!?
Sean is the leader of Gospel
eng anime called him Tory lol
Digimon localization is funny to me. Taichi became Tai. Yamoto became Matt. Sora Become Sora. Koushiro became Izzy. Mimi became Mimi. Jyou became Joe. Takeru became TK. And Hikari became Kari. Also Taichi and Hikari have the last name Yagami. So Hikari meaning Light my head canon is in high school she finds a deathnote. phanto274Ohoho Cheer100
run good when you need to
sick screen pause area grab xd
I sent the komari moment clip to komari
wait I died to numberman and not stoneman Jebaited
the dmg ramps up fast. is there a way to lower their dmg or get more hp by this point normally?
i dont really know what armor is in this context
feels like with the damage amount its always going to be a 2 mistakes and die in the 2nd half of the game
might need a save state and practice him if hes that hard
Besides the rng manip it does look fun
not even5 mins in if you wanna reset then you can
How many loops are we on now?  Lost track of the constant groundhog days passed
oh yeah i wasnt saying you should reset, just that if you want to you should xd. no stress
this game seems like a lot of escape RNG for really really good times
sure, you said you just came back to the game right
any reason why scenario 2 ost goes so hard?
the decision making in chip selection when escape doesnt show up is probably very important too
I thought I heard gets you hard HUH
wee bit of a struggle with that draw and still a gold
WHY DO YOU THINK I LOVE SPEEDRUNNING BN2
BECAUSE I CAN PRISM GLITCH HIM IN THE FUCKING DICK
YOu should play BN5, it doesnt have gutsman KEKW
Ill make my own BN with blackjack and hookers
plus you have my shitty notes LUL
wait? blackjack in a BN game?
lets be fair here, its one scenario
i thought the worst part was sky gauntlets
its still funny to me that have "Dont Touch Grass The Scenario"
how "tough" is the toughest BN6 encounter vs other BN games
BN5 has some tough ones in liberations
casually tho a lot of people struggle with heatman kettles
I want to watch BN3 speedruns without Var sword
youll have to watch a vod from 10 years then when they ran master style
@Axl_SR cool? is that something easy to find on youtube or smth?
@aotwking one of kilios earlier runs doing masterstyle
11 years ago and no var sword
there are prob faster master style runs in his highlights but too lazy to look
no i apprecite it alot ty ty ty
he does have varsword tho, I did see it used as a regular sword
thats how i played as a kid so itll be fun to watch
if you wanna know you can just to any fight bubbleman and beyond
var sword just 160 shortd sword xd
i missed the end of the polar skip also why is it called polar bear skip
the nintey degree angle towards us
i remember now. you reset on it earlier
so just watched this old kilios clip, he was fight meteor Omega moved to bottom front with a bounder behind him. Metoer used are grab and kilios was wood. That fight didnt last long LUL
sounds neat but i dont know who omega is.
ima go watch that video axl linked
nomming on pudding cause what else can I eat phanto274Smile
suck it rest of the chat!!
PartyHat Happy Affiliate anniversary! And of course have fun!
well you do like 20 fights and you get a new style
LUL insert *3 hours later* sound effect
oh man this is so confusing since I only know 3 of the 5 games FeelsGoodMan
What can be randomized in SMW but the 4 switches ?
Ok but i mean, for SMW, what could be usefull but the switches ?
There's a lot of Zelda in here.
yoshis island handled it the same way, beanstalk flower is an item, morphing is an item, you start with only 1 egg and to carry one more is an item, ect.
Is Paper Mario still in beta for archipelago
paper mario will never make it to AP front page if that is what you are waiting on lol
that TM could be growl for all we know KEKW
10k gold for PKMN when sold ;-)
they couldve just left her there.Yuri could just replace her and no one would know LUL
I see 6 BMDs for shcool comp 1
looks like the both have 2 fake BMDs
thats the only one I memoried, its for superr armor
kill the elebee I use elecswrd 2 delete LUL
a little while ago I remove all the jobs from the BN tracker so now I dont have to worry about that anymore
ultra balls in the first shop? Not sure how I feel about that one
do you know all the hidden items?
so I just asked in emerald discord and you "can" do that too but it requires turning on hidden items, then excluding all hidden item locations phanto274Smile
There's a PR open for adding a bunch of item/location groups to make this easier, but it needs reviews
One Piece has an attack called Dai Enkai: Entei meaning Great Flame Commandment/Precept: Flame Emperor. So Entei means Flame Emperor.
Id like BN6 to be added to AP just so crosses could be added to the pool
I find it funny while beastman was original it was modeled heavy from slashman, then in 6 we actually got slash man LUL
i do think beast has the cooler design
I didn't know crystal was on archipelago, or what kind of multiworld is this?
paper mario isn't on there either? Are they like not "officially" supported or what?
i was surprised you picked crystal over emerald honestly
I case I ever have norman early I start with lucky eggs
I think there are a few options in emerald to reduce the number of checks surf unlocks
I do like the change on route 123 letting you get all the items on one trip. Thats annoying in vanilla
i thought they just made the old emerrald tracker?
I was underr the impression that zunawe made emerrald
LuvSign usually youtube watcher but had free time so stopping in
Money protects against evil spirits.  Capitalism wins again.
I mean that unlocks a LOT in bm3 due to money as well as yoshi and fly?
How would it be out of logic just curious.
Literally complaining about no weapon hilariously enough.
The game heard you and decided on the most hilarious outcome.
oh i missed all of pape
did you have a hammerr tho?
did you play the PC build of this?
reminder that shake S is a trade
shake trade is in SciLab btw
oh wow, pape says you did zero checks
what arre these Pokey scaled to? Kappa
sounds like it opens a bird cage?
itt did look like a mushroom lol
it was showing zero a minute ago
smw is just beat bowser? so you could abuse starr rod?
you can do shake glitch now LUL
did you do anything after lotto codes?
especially with panels that adds a bunch
wonder which game youll find your notches in Kappa
whats the text say for the present?
all those buttons on the dual sense and no space for a run button... FeelsBadMan
um do you have setting on
Black or pseudo-melanistic tigers exist because of a genetic quirk that creates a unique phenotype. The Simlipal Tiger Reserve is the only habitat where these cats are found in the wild. More than 60% of Simlipal's tigers are 'black', according to Govt data. Full Disclaimer: i dont own this TTS and the credit goes to the rightful owners. Cheer100
its does but snes 9x is better
to the hint blocks give progession hints?
I see an attempt counter, can we expect more 5 game randos LUL
cant you reach that jumping off yoshi?
only thing i hate about this rando is run is randomized
i had to beat this level once  without swim its was not fun
yeah i had to re learn the game without run
one thing i really like about emerrald AP, you could trade a poke to another emerald world, they could give it a good TM then trade it back
what if all that stuff is in this world Jebaited
last time i did this i had to fight bowser with only the mushroom power up never got the others
think you can with jumping off yoshi but logically need climb
whooooaaaa what’s happening???? cross game rando?!
lol it says pape and crystal are connected but bn is disconnected LUL
one single unlocker is so broken lol
did you do the van too?
Cause it's using 700tb of ram to load one browser tab
it's not like jacking into a grill though
Yeah you can jack into a grill in BN2
Woah wait, how does SMW archipelago work? What are the checks?
well shit, my sister has mario party superstars too LUL
one for each game in the rando! lol
I also have superstars sooo I’m like 👀
Suggestion: If someone sends a chat message over 120 character phantomgamesbot says: "I'm not reading all that"
I’ve never played BN…any of em. these look fun.
They do look fun, but the phrasec
Look…MegaMan gotta do what he gotta do.
BN5 has a typo where it literally says "jack off"
I'm not trying to shame, it just sounds painful
@axl_sr plot twist, it wasn't a typo Kappa
I've never played Battle Network but I've played One Step From Eden which was really fun. I don't remember anything bout jacking in that game though.
so glad they neverr brought energy change and press back
had to head out for a bit. im back now, hows it going
love that the music turned into a minor key when you got Goombario
Wait, you just straight up go to the afterworld in this game? That's metal as hell
in the spirit of archipelago it should just take you to the game Hades instead :D
so what conditions need to be met for games to be randomized together?
I blame Goompa for being a bad role model
Oh I thought the lag was because I'm in the middle of a hurricane
I just give my yaml to someone else and let them do it lol
there's like 60 something games currently and like a bunch of others in beta I think.
I guess it's just my sweet baby boy falling behind because of his homeschooling
Look at our Phantom, going on a little adventure with Goombario... how cute. KEKW
Oh that's actually crazy. Is it like that with any other games?
rip mm and tp for using the same thing
oh it's the rando that's the issue not paper mario itself that makes more sense
speaking of mm there is a app world for it but its really buggy rn
Oh huh, that's crazy. Is Archipelago open source?
So basically, if you want to do Paper Mario on Archipelago, you gotta use trickery?
so whats your goal time for a 5 map rando?
so i was told the mm for ap is being built from the ground up for ap since mm is c+
and once you do it the one time its done
with OoT in AP im surprised it didnt have MM
oh so when you beat a game you get everything that you missed from that game?
im kinda surprised the oot pc port isnt supported yet
how many extra undernet ranks did you gen?
yeah I was gonna say when you win a battle in BN3 what is the drop table for the random encounters?
my dream rando is dark cloud 2
feels like a BN1-6 randomizer would be spicy xd
I think I missed it, what do you need the star pieces for?
there was a dedicated site for it but looks like its down
oh RvPA you have 16 hours to post a yaml in the mom discord
ss rando used the mit license, maybe one day they will add that to archi
Is it just Links Awakening that shows all received items instead of just the ones for your game?
I can't wait for like 20 years from  now when we can have multi-game entrance randomizer in archipelago that would be trippy and fun af
i think the oot/mm rando has that
I think LLTP/Super Metroid might as well.
yep map rando has an APWorld already too
right you do have mushroom now
spin jump as big for 1 exit in the forest
in vanilla which gym give whirlpool?
I had to go for a bit can you run yet?
if you are little and toucha feather will it at least make you big?
also I do know carrying a shell to the goal gets you a power up too
there is a room in a cave where you run with a star
cause it sinks in the lava
you can beat that level axl jump off yoshi near the end
those spiked enemies you can spin jump off of them
Yo Phantom how goes the AP world?
one of the star world level take 2 seconds
wait? yoshis house becomes secret area?
oh right, the lakitu and the yellow yoshi egg
so do you need all the yoshi coins as part of completing?
You didn’t need that P switch -Yoshi Clueless
Rock Lee vs Gaara fight is anime proof that random seeding is so tragic. Had the number 3 seed (possibly 2) playing against number 1 seed first round is insane.
hope the seed's cookin not too much shenanigans
something I learned while playing this
even without run, you can hold B and have a slightly faster run
@Axl_SR In this essay I will prove that the weights on rock lees legs weighed atleast twice as much as rock lee himself.
I learned that through the power of having had grab but no run
Oh man I had no idea power ups were checks too
power ups if shuffled out / not yet available in order go mushroom, fireflower, cape, no?
oh hey its the waiting room castle
or was it the one before? I honestly dont renember
the ones with the snake blocks are the actual worst
cus you cant speed ANY piece of it up
at least in this castle, you can try to cheese a cycle or 2 out
I love how they play the intense music for this
this is like the definition of intense gameplay totally
unbeatable without run, star or yoshi this SMILERS
and I honest dont know which of them are logic for the room aside of star
that moment when you need to buffer 4 spinputs for mario not to fall off the map c.c
Oh man that has so much more oomf in the song than the GBA version
I also recall this level not being fun
this level is fine if you are able to do things
maybe it’s just a lot or backtracking
you can spin jump on the green spotlights
oh god the gas bubble room
it's even better without p speed!
which solution you usin for this?
there are a couple other setups outside of on hardware
but I dont know about transferring saves
so ya didnt look into Zsnes or whatever the other options are yea
I can see reasons behind that - also for me weirdly enough, the other options never worked in setup
snes9x would be the one they mention if specifically snes only stuff
I mean it could be worse, it could open up internet explorer
you mean they fixed 1 out of 2 million things
1 thing I dont get about archipelago right
cus there's lots of fun things I dont get but also dont question bc why
is about UI design / basic string parsing
and I am like - "uhhh you know - just make proper string parsing,"
yea ofc its now hitting more people
if only you could send coins to pape then all these coins would be useful!
more people finally gave up fighting windows update
thats all I got for this
like - just write yourself a basic file explorer, its not hard
but there's some bits and pieces which I dont get why they never were tackled
and its not even high end stuff
like - we talkin "browser window while genning seed doesnt flashbang the user" or "hey, stirngs get parsed by taking blank spaces out"
cus if you looked at any yaml, you noticed that its all via backspaces, its not just taking a linebreak as end of line, cutting every line's front off of ANY blank space code"
the launcher I am not even mad about
and yea I know its not "good"
for that there would have to also be coherence between how all of the apworlds are handled
like yea you could do that, but also - "that screams about problems with switching between games much" if its using the same general UI window
I can only imagine how people who aren’t very computer literate try and use AP. they probably don’t
like - I hope I am makin sense, cus I know what you're roughly talkin about
@Amishman19 they find people who are
like - what I would guess the best for UI handling the yamls within the thing (or separate window) would be if it could reasonably fetch from the respective APWorld what settings there are to then throw a UI together dynamically from that
problem then again boils down to writing it in such a way that the UI doesnt combobulate on itself and throws 10 items onto 1 spot
my point moreso goes towards "front end nasty and if back end person touches front end front end borky no one know brain headaches" you know
I found you on YouTube playing paper Mario randomizer and it was awesome haha!
that sounds very "I touched everything" yea
like - my guess for UI stuff goes "first fix the apworld settings parsing" so it cuts out all the empty spaces in front of any settings line reliably
like - distinct "hey this is end of line / new line" detection which should be free to do
Thank you! Glad to be here😊
literally taking every potential symbol from backspace to tab to line break / new line within ascii -> done
cus THAT ALONE would get people less confused when say, someone tells them how to do starting items or junked locations
they copy paste in a block
but its not properly aligned with everything else ==> invalid yaml
BIG "why the fuck this be happening"
can the same boss appear multiple times?
@Darkness3827 depends on how you set boss shuffle up
during 1 to 1 shuffle, every boss of vanilla exists somewhere
with like 3 or 4 reznors total?
in 3 I think is where you need secret to go to chocolate
the fun bit is I should know this
cus its not been too too long since I messed with this in AP
yea its forest of illusion 3 where you'd want secret exit
do you have anything except mushroom, yoshi, and spin?
you know that, I know that, but they dont know that Kappa
one of the powerups should be being able to go left and if you don't have it it should play like SMB1 :P
there is that jumbled up text above the map on level select which shows by single letter and icon, what you got
I wish I knew off the top of my head whats what there
SMW logic for power ups is fun, isnt it
Phone died but I'm back now bahaha PopNemo
problem to that is its not different to vanilla SMW
where power ups just do this unless you code them differently
which I dont think anyone has ever done
I sick at this game if I'm being honest 😭🤣
best of luck phantom. may your next snacktime be especially tasty
64 would be more simplistic then this one I feel like
in a pipe near the end yea
Do you play any donkey Kong country?
good thing is you get a shroom right here every try
yeah but at least 64 isn't 95% linear
its actively fighting the user more I feel like
Sonic Adventure 2 is in AP KEKW
i wish it wasn't the pc port i am too stupid to set it up even tho its prob easy
then I couldnt even install it because bitdefender would just burn SM64 AP setup during setup
cus its that much a fucked up way of doing it
like - I dont know WHAT they did
but its most certainly a very very VERY unique way
I forgot that this game has so many autoscroller style levels particularly the castles.
Still better than the lost levels castles tho
like - give me a flips patching system for it, I'd be down despite not liking SM64s AP rando implement
if you go for dragon coins, where the snake block goes down you get an H
now you can get the dragon coins
you get all 5 if going that path
you do have a mushroom too
just would mean if you were going for blocks that you'd be in a bit of a pickle
but given what your check total for SMW looks, its just exits and dragon coins?
I was doing Sunshine jumps LMFAO
can mario games please not just jank
it even reflected for a frame lmao but was like nah on second thought murder is better
[ foreboding castle sting ] [ happy level 1 music ]
the hothead decided to eat you?
very VERY screen edge loading related
go down with the snake block where it goes down
a) H, b) you get to the 2nd section of this castle
c) you dont have to play with more hotheads then need be
I always thought it was lmao
its to get you to call the nintendo 90s tip hotline LUL
dont you know nintendo loves to troll in 2d mario
BUT ONLY if they are the ones doing it?
yeah that'd fit in perfect with lost levels
DKC has a shit ton of stuff like that
SMB1 has had haha lmao stuff, SMB3 has the funky mechanics to get to warp whistles
SMW has an attempt at branching paths so you have slightly different branching paths
which is why we didn't get it in the US lol
Lost levels I didnt even mention cus its riddled with it yea
I was on the wrong castle valsRIP
legit confused the 2 snake block castles >.>
cus 1 of them you have a path up directly to the 2nd section, the other (this one) you dont
yea and then while you can puzzle it out, you have stuff which is "huh" levels in NSMB, NSMB2, Wii, deluxe
I think the only nes games that need a guide book is zelda 2 and nestroid
zelda 1 is pretty cryptic too
zelda 1 is not even cryptic as much as it just fell victim to bad translation
like - the original not translated texts are good hints
but then during translating it to english, something fucked up fierce
sorry again also for derping on the castle info stuff
because at this point, based on the forts you'd reach is wendy's
then after you are in valley of bowser and get either iggy(?) or the reznor fort down there towards back door
to reach forest fortress you'd need flying
so either p balloon or cape
or bring a blue yoshi over
cus you'd have to go forest 1, forest 4, forest secret, forest secret fort then
thanks for letting us know, game
to exit this castle normal path, you just end of this room, and near end of the next after, you take the PSwitch path
if its about hidden exit, you bring the block boos over to here then up and over
am I again confusing the ghost houses
yea block boos to that door
then here you just take the normal exit
know the rules of this level?
cus this one is super fun disgust
for reference of why I am like "yea this is disgust level"
its a room with sets of rooms and the number of coins, dragon coins and the remaining time play roles
first is based on coins collected
2nd set is based on how quick you went
with the best path being 249 to 235 remaining on the clock
then the exit room here based on dragon coins
if you woulda had collected 1 more, you woulda fucked yourself
and its the ONLY level where thehy did that
luckily RA is getting more help there finally
that why i use snes9x for this game
snes is fine gamecube is alright n64 fuxking sucks
you HAVE to go and fix the input delay on snes9x and for that you have to know that its ON PURPOSE adding input delay
you playing on bizhawk tho bizhawk just sucks for anything
bizhawk is the easiest to set up AP stuff
cus its the most used so far
bizhawk is good for tas, but just dont try to actually play on it
I am hoping for RA, since that would at least allow other options
I feel bad that I don't know what you guys are talking about haha😅
if you can use RA for one thing, you can use it for all of them
go back to chocolate island 2
and then go to the secret exit using this
it gets you to the pipe and from tehre to wendy
non secret exit chocolate island is rough
basically: dont collect coins, be quick
as in more then 250s on timer
then you're at the secret exit room of choco 2
is because this info block here tells you
HUH only the 1st pipe matter for secret ext its above 250 coins only change the rooms
the thing is blacktiger: more coins collected -> less time remaining
meaning you going for more coins dicks you over for the 2nd set of rooms
but you'd still need 1 more
you only did main castles so far, need 7 total?
you can get a yoshi in this first room middle topo block
SMILERS playing without power ups is fun wdym YEPSPIN
not true you got storeroom key lmao!
there's more then just 2 baseball chucks
also they can each throw 4 balls before break
or just go ham cus they feel like it
if you can bounce on them once, they will revert to being charging chucks
the only power up you get here is yosh yea - which arguably is a shit powerup
cus it got NO invuln frames
the throw blocks you can druck -> let go, even if its not a throw, it cn defeat enemies
VERY much not a "taught by game" thing
As someone who only emulated pokemon before trying pape Rando I feel very blessed
wanted to say, with pokemon you dont really NEED tight inputs
not a platformer or an action game
Yeah, which is why I don't think I ever noticed things not being emulated correctly
yep - and granted for SNES there is 0 input delay emulation available
but its not easily set up for AP
closest was probably replaying TTYD on a non CRT TV
this do be very much among the hard levels which get easier by having top secret area
cus you can just fly over shit
well outside of SMW it's been ight
can't wait for you to finish this without run then go to pape and run is in the storeroom. NotLikeThis
That's so troll to make that part not slideable
geez that's barely possible without run
so you dont need to fight bowser?
also I see we at wendys
@Darkness3827 well 5 guys doesnt exist on yoshis island
its basically a "wendys or no fast food" island
the fact that the other powerups don't give you a mushroom is so evil
it wouldnt help much though, no?
for that you need all of them
power up order is shroom -> flower -> cape
to me this is very "if you LOVE SMw
if you dont LOVE SMW - its more a 1off
how many bosses do you need still?
so this, vanilla dome -> going through front door?
I do hope it makes sense that I still pushed for you getting this castle though?
given out of what, 11 castles, you need 7?
and that means you dont get around needing 1 choco island one then?
reznor is a fun fight, isnt it
if it wouldnt spin clockwise, you'd not get the memo either
I was surprised to see it in here
this one is a vine climb
you can technically by having yoshi
gotta conserve a blue shell though
which I dont think is intended solution but doable
also cap can with a tech
you need blue shell for flight yoshi if you dont wanna dismount jump up
oh cool, FINAL FANTASY I-VI COLLECTION is getting a physical release here in october
cus then you can just wing flight up, skip the vine climb itself
I like how the mobile collection still costs like $50
good thing is dismount jump should reach this
I wonder if it's the most expensive thing on the app store it's prolly close
then only 3 more levels here
I mean 5 & 6 are great games but I'd rather just play the GBA versions personally
cus its one of their big name IPS
hoping ppl would suck it up
also dont know for sure but i heard its coming to mojor relailers too
Oh hey they're on sale rn! Only 14.50 for V/VI LUL
even you wait on a gamefly used sale itll got for 45 or 50 bucks
Final Fantasy XII is still $50 for a 2017 hd port of like a 2007 version of a 2006 game LUL
It's one of my favorite games ever but still that's absurd
this is among the free levels just a minor bit annoying
i got 12 on sale and still till this day i have never played it
you should be able to spin jump on the fish
the fact you dont have to deal with the dolphins
the pufferfish imo is WAY less problematic then the dolphins
just saying compared to some of the levels in this game you did before this, this one is an ez one
I have done so many levels without cape even casually cus I have played this game with siblings in couch coop controller pass-along
WWW ID opens a few things
that to me, the power ups dont rly matter tooooo too much
thanks rando that helps a ton
PartyHat um I don't see Rayman on this list??
why are coins even a thing you can get from the rando
I cant say this game is ez though like - at all
I mean this could be worse, it could be the lost levels, that'd be impossible with the input delay
dont forget lost levels also having the funny haha "oh THIS is not the troll spring"
which granted - I will give the ppl who made lost levels that they were experimenting with A LOT
but it definitely is rough around the edges
idk what's the worst between the springs, the wind, or the castles in lost levels
also wanna say that reaching either fortress fort or the choco fort would have been worse then wendy
oh hey you got super boots that's nice
this is the donut secret ghost house, right?
far left end of this room has a p switch
then you take the middel block above normal door
did I mention I played this game / watched this game too much as a kid?
like MANY of the "core line-up" nintendo titles PrideLaugh
like - I casually 100%ed this game a couple times
not as often as MM or OoT / N64 to gamecube games
but it was among the ones I did play a fair bit
if yoshi eats a star he instantly grows big
any power up / 1up for that matter
otherwise its supposed to be 5 enemies
blue yoshi can eat any shell for wings right>
blue yoshi over any other yoshi for flight
I wanna stop havin to carry fruit in sunshine for movement unlocking yoshis c.c
also holy SMW why you havin so much good shit
you skip the first half of the castle?
you can have front be back, back be front
🙃 you are talkin to someone who for sillies had his yaml set to gauntlet castle
but then somehow managed to also set a 50/50 yoshi egg seed
so I went and did the gauntlet
gauntlet castle? You can do all 8 rooms? SICK!
realised it wont help cus bowser was stuck in attack loop on 2nd phase
you absolutely can set that up
can you do it if you like yourself? yes
I am gettin to the point where I want fludd back man
very much did it to myself
I always love bossfights with downtime where you can't do anything
yeah that's not my favorite fight ever lmao
well that mario is made of paper so he's totally different
SMW has had 4 emerald badges
i wish we could go to yoshis island LUL
I was thinking the game for a second too lmao
@Axl_SR Is that in archipelago that'd be more fun than SMW I think
I did yoshis island but I think phantom doesnt like it
for one, your ability to carry more then 1 egg is shuffled away
then minigames, your various transform abilities
why do platformer randomizers have to take away the stupidest things?
like - its imo worse then how SMW handles itself as much as it can again be fun
@Darkness3827 the big problem with pure platformers is the fact you dont really have much you can reasonably shuffle away which wouldnt also hurt the game in return
so ppl try figuring out ways which would make sense
except it will definitely change how you approach a platformer big time
yeah ig especially in 2D platformers. With like 64 you could just shuffle the stars & keys and call it a day pretty much. Idk how you'd do that for a 2D platformer, ig make it so access to levels was in the pool that's all I can think of.
@Darkness3827 except with 64 you can also shuffle level order in theory
just isnt done as indepth as you could in AP's implement
and you also can shuffle away your moves if you wish to
why does deep focus look like that? is that a rando sprite?
so triple jumps, diving, long jumping
Yeah I think it uses a beta version of the sprite but only when you pick it up
yeah you got one from SMW
in AP reverse forest is out of logic?
lol it sent it when you opened the chest apparently
might just be how this one is implemented
WWR in AP also sends super early
they look weird with only colored feet/mouths
wow what a good check to get Kappa
I mean it could be worse, it could be more coins in SMW
@Darkness3827 dont forget potions or pokeballs
eh at least those can be used for something
surely those are all still at least comparable to Deep Focus
we heard you the first time!
head off to bed, good luck finishing
i wished you a happy affiliate anniversary
and it didn't even come in
I mean that's better than 1 coin ig???
Yooo Phantom phanto274BLANKIES  happy actual anniversary
is it a server side thing with twitch anniversary stuff when it gets shown to people?
are the tms randomized too or just the default?
I gotta hit the hay now, gl finishing this out Phantom!
must be hard keeping track lol
ah good ole BN3 and your broken chips
that’s why Var sword had to be nerfed
and now I am awake again paperLurk
imagine if we find a random Bass chip
think the thing is like 700 power AoE
my experience with mbn was playing up to the first robot master in bn1, dying, and realizing that I hadn’t saved at all
yeah I haven’t touched the game since
I’m so spoiled by autosaves and continues in modern games
so is the walking noise just the item jingle?
that can fight a water type
They say when you see a Chansey it brings good luck Kappa
Your run is now blessed phanto274Bless
i fell asleep. can you restart the rando plz? Kappa
6 game rando with tp next
well on the bright side you're still doing better than my first pm64 glitchless run
maybe grab a gun in battle network and just shoot him?
You're on mountain no one would know
i would grab a fire flower and just burn him to a crisp
yo i think your entei left his ball to go party
i hope he doesn't run out of pp
lol, Lugia just passed out on a road in Kanto
i had a dream when i was like 7 that luigi's mansion was lugia's mansion
not if i do it first
as long as it doesn't learn harden, right
this route 2 music fucks sooooooo hard
splash do u wanna play splatoon
Oh ye gods you're still goin huh?
I hope not, it's been 9 hours already
wait I need to add an emote 1s
yea 4 hours is overworking :D
One left the house to go get 49th at supernova
I've been freed from the shackles of "Wisconsin"
sounds like there was a wild night
honestly, prime real estate for a ritual summoning
i love when the sound card starts detuning randomly in this game
No please don't send me back
Did you hear there are bedbugs, mold, and bloodstains in Gimr's hair?
Gotta start getting familiar with those modes again
Which is Cross keys + all bosses
I made a major boo boo in Crosskeys tonight and still got a 2:32
I also don't use a map tracker for crosskeys too
So we really testing the brain power
"Old man, why do you know what's in this little girl's bedroom????"
is there a difference between run / bike?
alright I tried my hardest but i ain't makin it to the end of the seed
yea i'll watch til 2 but i doubt i'm making it awake longer than that without starting another caffeine source
it's kinda fun to see this game without 1000 clips
ya i actually couldn't tell you how to do vanilla dungeons in this game
how much longer do you think this'll take
PartyHat Happy Affiliate anniversary! wtf is this rando
makes sense for a ghost to hang out here
do you have to beat all 5 of them? What are the goals in each?
yeah I figure that's probably the easiest one to do?
I admit, I've never seen a rando of any platformer games like Mario because I'm like, "What's there to randomize...?"
I'm trying to imagine how all of these games would even be hooked up
that was going to be my next question
but I'm sure there's some setting that allows you do make your life miserable
I was just typing that out
well gl, I must sleep. Looks like you have about another 2-3 hours left. Gonna be some good YT content
She just rubbed her juices all over your body
Fun fact, only like 5 of those hit count
You and Hothead have to move a frame for the hits to count LUL
don't come near me with piss fingers
I don't want extra chocolate on my cookies, okay
not even some warm, gooey fudge?
nah those cookies are cream filled
At least he didn't ask for helping eating his creampie
TBH this has all been pretty random
so are you planning to finish tonight?
you better finish soon I wanna go to bed but I also wanna see this shit end
how do I see it if I'm asleep
"Phantom begrudgingly saves the Yoshi kids"
Gonna load it up on 8 browser tabs
will it be longer than watching lord of the rings trilogy or a Star Wars trilogy
sweet you can go to d8 now
We could logically beat LADX now
Yeah Lugia is a TANK as in big phat wall
must of rolled bad on the special def
to be fair spdef and health are like the only good stats noctowl has
lugia weak to like 9999 moves
well now you can set up
Blue must be mad as hell if he losing to that team
ok I'm gonna lie in bed now have fun killing the rest of this I will be staring while cozy
one last OVERWORKING for the road cause you just did it a 3rd time
@ youtube that emote is big eyes staring at a 4 hour stream time
Silently lurking but still amazed you're still going. Endurance at 200. LUL
oh each undernet rank is a random item you need to get from a diff game?
i dont remember the chip but i remember the serenity person
its not that much to learn I think but fair enough ff 1 would be the easiest to add
must only be like 8 key items
trying a new ios app since twitch app is now terrible beyond bad
Lord of the Rings trilogy is 9.5 hours long
Can't race tonight. Playing 7 days with the old man
It's a zombie game and I'm playing with father
Isaac is very good about timing
I'll be back in 20 mins... this feels off lolz
Alright so this is where we say something about the jet seed so it takes forever right?
Bets on if seed is good or garbage lolz
I wonder what the first item will be
Was gonna sat iron boots but okay lolz
Oh. See I just get scared of them having something and me missing it
Alright... I'm calling it... going to be a bad one
Oh yea, I wasn't paying attention to the duneon
Oh no it's city again? Why is that one so common
Yes but the amount of items makes it lean more toward bad
It seems like almost every seed I have it. It's why I asked that one time. But it's no biggy
I thought you were gonna fight the boss just because lolz
At least it isn't in Darknut like it has been once in the past
I don't think wallet should be fanfare. It's almost never needed
He says not too bad :3
Come on, be good for once
HE HAD AN ITEM? The one time I don't race
I hate getting ads after you ask a question lolz
I can NEVER get that jump
It's interesting to see how others do that jump ngl
i played the wii version of this and its still a total mindfuck that for me this version is mirrored and it feels like a totally different game
tbf, the wii version is the flipped version
because they wanted link to be right handed so instead of changing link they FLIPPED THE ENTIRE GAME
Wait but they did change link no?
no they flipped the entire game
Yea I played it a bit when I was a kid. Prefered the GC version personally
yeah its the laziest way but very effective
Imagine putting a mirror near link...it's fascinating when you have it in your head
i dont think any other game pulled off a deliberate mirror for another version
Yoo Phantom, good luck in the race phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Smile
Yes. But I don't think it was during a race. Probably during my quad damage run though
Yea because wolf takes 8x damage
That shield that's one of it's kind and was difficult to get
This is my favorite cave to just skip
Idk I like time better than city
Hey you got great fairy tears lolz
At least we know Agitha basically only has 1 check that's good then
This boss is just annoying because she's RNG
Basically it's the likelyhood of something happening based on a string of numbers
If RNJesus doesn't like you, you could be screwed
Please tell me that was an accident lolz
Nope. That is a thing people say.
Phan will you ever do a see with bonk damage?
It is interesting I must say. Doing it with any kind of damage multiplier sucks though
You do it by instinct sometimes
Just be uber careful at all times, until later on in the game where everything one shots you
That's the only DCS check not possible due to wolf jump
I mean it's kinda in the same area? I don't know about that though
So your goron mines is like Peaches and my City
I know I brought up how you get goron mines a lot here
Oh hey don't forget that like I did that one time
YOu're not participating in the massive 5 golden pigs race? LUL
Bro I thought I had it because  I used finish on City and LBT so I thought I was good.
there's like 1.3k people watching pape
what a fuckin' ASSHOLE, holy moly
74 bought me a poke bowl a bit ago
I mean, we could go to city. We have everything except spinner
You hate it with a passion lolz
So I think that means if gale isn't here it's in ToT right?
Dude I second that the hardest
I think you got a hint about cat rescue
That is huge. That means it's just city boss then ganon
I was wrong... not a bad seed lolz
Omg does this mean new pb?
Keep forgetting to take the boots off I believe
Fun fact you don't have to have ending blow to finish this boss.....
Didn't they say to have the peehat sink, when he fires take off the boots and then immediately move?
Yea this and LBT you don't need it.....
I could be remembering it wrong so my fault if I am
My favorite strat with these guys with B&C
Plus you got GFT and some great music climbing the castle
It's not as hard as you'd think. But I get cha
Yea it's basically you hit the shield, and then waddle around him.  Hit Axel
DK64 has it where it moves slowly if you hold Z, would be nice if TP could do something like that
Let's hope for good zelda RNG
2 mins at most I think
That was called the DUI horseback xD
Horse phase is the highest RNG section of the whole fight
You either get run over or you can avoid him
A race to the finish if you will
I remember you being in GM...then I left for a bit...came back and you were gonna enter city
South of Castle Town I think
Was still worth looking into no?
Having a dead dungeon is confusing
I went back and full cleared the desert because I thought no one else would
is there an option to set how many sky character + book you need for CitS?
whats it set to in this
One was the lantern chest in the KG cave
was thinkin if you could set it to half of them needed for cannon
but only half needed with guarantee none locked behind
though then you could have those "Oh I just picked up the ez ones" routing differences
Dammit was gonna do dishes before you decided lolz
I was gonna ask what's the difference between shards and fused shadows but I think I just learned xD
hmm can keys be shuffled just dungeon-wide?
but any dungeon rather then anywhere
imagine if there’s a four swords mode
The race seeds are posted in the tpr discord?
Balanced is more like "subpar" lol
Very strong has all of the beyond this point signs, and barren hints prioritize their own zone
Very strong should be called Focused
Oh yeah new trailer for Echoes of Wisdom came out recently
oh yeah I think I heard bout that
seemed kinda interesting but then I forgot about that
the zelda makers are neat, played one called quest master that's in EA, made a fun dungeon in it
should make a new one in the newest theme
If it’s a rougelike like Issac then it’ll take a while for it to have content
the dungeon making is pretty intuitive
overworld making will be coming at full release iirc
nah Zelda Classic is a 25 year old program that lets you make custom zelda quests
do you remember your very first email? Mine was Yoshiman64 at ign64 dot com. Back in the 90s ign only covered N64 stuff and even offered free email lol
and during the BN era I used megavsproto at yahoo KEKW
you shouldve played it and went for a PB LUL
Second Verse hopefully different than the first
im happy I got 4th in this weekly
I couldn't figure out the logic for the irons
The logic was "Ordon is broken"
i just meant I couldn't deduce what sphere it was
cuz I lacked so much stuff
also i think my dungeon clear route was suboptimal
cuz I left to get agitha sword
cuz I didn't wanna go tot
Jovani was very handy that time
it had a sword but I wanted the agitha one
so as soon as I got spinner and boomer
I left city and got it
yeah ordon was hard to go back to cuz you know cat got hinted and bo got hinted
I luckily found the Ordon path hint in EF and then immediately got lantern
so you ran back for solo goats or you find lantern first
I had skipped Ordon at the start, so I full cleared when I went back
I was just looking at Breath of Fire stuff, so you getting the fishing line immediately as I tune in, is funny to me
Of cuckoo doesn't jump off you'll be good lolz
Go out for a night in town
I didn't sign up for what schwasty is lolz
I mean, I'd just like a drink or 2, personally
i love that rando makes link's tunic look like a 4 year old who dressed themselves
this is why we don't mix colors when doing laundry
Oh no you can mix colors... just have the water on cold
Oh yeah that is not an Always hint outside of the race distribution
Yeah because of the poe next to it
yeah we have access to a not bad weapon
Doctor doctor... here's a pop tart. Now can you... diagnose these beepy hearts
That didn't surprise me tbh lolz
cave should be filled anew, no chest spawns electric boogaloo
Wolf is good for this room
YAAY DOMROD 2 LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOO Happy
My day's not as great, I'm hangover af
I could tell you ways to help you with that hangover
Okay so... the first is always the most common: sip water throughout the day and eat something that can absorb what you drank like bread
Then you have take a shot but people tend to end up with more drinks. Don't sleep it off... it'll make the hangover worse
swordless AG full clear access sounds so cursed
Oh yeah there is only one chest before the key door lol
Just remember to find something filling. And says where you think you're done drinking... get something small and do the water thing before going to bed
I know link isn't spinning that fast only because is the peehat lolz
Phan I think your bot might be a degenerate
Roopa and I made the same mistake in seed #2 LUL
That’s mines and what a loaded desert
Boots and sword evo17Banzai phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Mash
we both never marked spherre zero scarf in harrys shop and HS from ch7 when we had bucket too lol
Can you beat stallord worth wooden sword?
That's vanilla behavior. No plans to change it
And it’s not required this seed
definitely the most bow-like bow i've ever seen
At least when the stone moves back
Also the small key in FT
that small key should melt doors in that temple
There's no cap, but I feel like we need a setting for it
Non-race generation is way more random
So overworld sucks right now got it
Half of the overworld is a graveyard
I mean they are very focused hints for the level of strength they possess
so now you found every configuration where this corner + owl is not working?
the other one close would be eldin bridge no?
the rest of them is okay
how many ppl do know about skipping that though
and the one near castle town is not too bad to line up
knowing you can without boomerang would be the bigger hurdle I think
cus the rang jumps you find quicker for the eldin bridge castel skip then no items wolf only
it seems the small keysanity didn’t matter much in trying to lengthen seeds
I wonder - does this keys any dungeon setting keep in check your required dungeons
could if not that explains why the items were all overworld
I got a hand written letter in the mail today "wonder if its a secret admirer"... it was an invitation to johovah's witness phanto274Smile
cus it could just put all small keys into the dungeons you need to beat
including running out of options due to that
I have returned to you being in LBT
this lakebed temple has a sense of humor
time for that something good on snowpeak
so other then keys- its just rang now?
I'd say AG since you know how to skip a couple in there, right?
Thank you for playing Zelda! Cheer20 twitch1934Rupee
most likely cus of how in most cases for vanilla, you would not need to return specifically to the boss key chest when you got it
I know the circumstance you're pointing out
but also feel like it wasnt thought of cus "why"
after 3 dungeons it feels like the one chest you'd not skip
so as much as I cant disagree with what you're sayin
and I mean like - this is the ONLY dungeon which does it
lakebed BK yes, but with that one you're also meant to see it as a puzzle from above and below
ALSO casually that enemy would be fought KEKW
I dont feel like the soulsborne-ian "run past everything" would apply to puzzle rooms in zelda games
and by all means I know that "ignore enemies" sentiment has existed before
just it got HUGE extra attention ever since souls games took off
thats a rarity I feel like
phantom someone is making a mm archi thing with the pc port lol
i mean technically recomp is more complete
I saw it and my hopes rly just are "make SURE you ask MMRfor n64 for logic help and shit"
if its like the SM64 AP stuff, I will just never do it
oh fun, so 2 gpl stuff
they just started making it a week ago too lol
if the recomp stuff is not a Sm64 hassle of atrocities to get working
technically it can BUT needs to be reqritten entirely
2nd issue with MMR is also it being in c# versus most AP stuff being python
just remake it from scratch 5Head
yea I know it cant be part of the install
and zoey (main MMR dev) didnt specifically say she'd be against it
just rewriting it entirely in python => ooof
is it not possible to change the license
so far no one wanted to
even if the license, you'd also have the C# to python difference
which you CAN interface around that
id rather use recomp than bizhawk at least lol
but I mean - phantom can tell ya tales about AP stuff
well, write a hook to work with retroarch then
yea I know its based on a core to core thing
but to my knowledge, RA has access to the core used by bizhawk
i'm at least half a decade out of date
you know what else has lua scripts
take the 2 most commonly used cores for N64 stuff which RA uses, write hooks
or focus on Ares if its that much more reliable
yea so then hooks for the 2 cores most commonly used on RA
or hell, given that nax has done a mod of PJ for the combo rando multi
ask how that worked and get PJ on board
(not you obviously, also I KNOW I am talkin out my ass)
but like - PJ you CAN write hook ins with lua support
as said, a fork of it is used for MMOoTR multis and co-ops
mm kinda works but not very well
i mean unless you use the mm pj64 build
@Feli_Heli I had no problems with MM on PJ for like 2 years and over 100+ MMR seeds what
all emu is bad to me
also n64 mm is bad too
long story short: we need to get away from biz only for certain AP things
and I personally would HEAVILY vouch RA with Parallel Launcher
cus a) you dont have to quickmenu for shit
imagine buying your OS and still getting ads in it
meaning b) simple core / widescreen etc options available
and c) RA can do lua stuff
id play tp archi on dolphin
dolphin is at least tolerable lol
id play games if my computer wasn't a potato
its mostly "just" the older consoles (namely, N64) where emu is just straight up a back rooms maze of options and knowledge required, no?
cus Gameboy and shit is not bad / has good options
same in technicality for SNES related
you can use mGBA, and its very neat
i say just n64 is the only bad system to emulated everything else feel fine to me
n64 runs on hopes, dreams, prayers, duct tape, WD-40, and mystery substance #232
I havnt done it mostly cus I have a working biz setup which I aint touching a settings option again on ever
somehow emulating an emulator (wii vc) is better than just using a normal n64 emulator
and it depending on the ones behind respective emus to help out where need be
cus I think thats also a problem?
heard at least that thats apparently why KH rando is PC port only, not PS2
he kinda messed up mm on gamecube though
we dont have to talk about that
@Jonxhas well the version for kh2 for rando is based of the final mix version only release in japan on ps2 we got it in English years later for ps3 4 and pc that was my guess
probably why i havent heard of it
its part of the zelda collection
I played OoT on GC and it was fine
@blacktiger51 which is not the issue
since for PS2 rando, you use KH2FM as base to patch
kinda odd that MM would be trash and OoT wouldn't
the issue is not the regional version you use with the emu
mm is quite hard to emulate
i think the gamecube was just not powerful enough tbh
KEKW DK64 with its specific DK64 biz version
@blacktiger51 as said though huge grain of salt, cus I never saw any of the discussions
i can see why they ported animal crossing to gamecube instead of emulating it
but from what I heard while main KH2 rando you can just boot with the PS2 emu options, you cant do AP because no one wanted to open that up and shit
and cus there's more to it then just loading lua scripts =>it promoblem
ahh yeah i was thinking they just didn't want people to get a jp rom for kh2
when your professional moblin has issues with its modem
@blacktiger51 thats rly just ppl needing to import the disks
it boiled down to a) "why, PC port works" and something along b) of emu specific shenaniganry
but as said. I am on hearsay, so please take me with a huge grain of salt
@Jonxhas yeah i know nothing for kh2 rando i just seen ap need pc version and i was like nope KEKW
@blacktiger51 at least these days you can hopefully soon go with the steam version
yeah when it go on sale for like 5 bucks so i can do 1 ap KEKW
just dual boot between pc, gc, ps2, and n64
Oh yeah I got FFXII and BDII half off iirc during like one of the summer/winter sales.
i hate it when someone triple stabs my eye with a master sword spin
lies, they're on sale for 20% off rn!!!
all 6 should of been 40 bucks tops on release
to be fair? 10 bucks to 15 bucks a game I can see
and in total them on steam being at 100 bucks without a sale is fine ish
mighta missed the games you're talkin about
that's like, the difference between not making rent and still not making rent but you tried™
I mean I kinda get 5 & 6, but 1-3 should be like $5 each lmao
they 19.19 can par games um no thanks KEKW
hey phantom im tired fix it
20% off rogue energy or 20% off FFPR hmmmmm....
yes i would like to purchase a 20-topic paragraph please
summary: fuck n64, fuck windows, fuck square enix
It seems like you have less health than normal there
Will you do anything after this?
maaan I never used file transfer between phones c.c
hoooly can you have it easy with that if it works
for reference: my old phone has a bulged battery which managed to clip the backside of the case off
soooo I kinda dont trust that thing to not turn into a fire hazard 🤣
You need a new phone Jon
just transfering the data between them rn
Yeah keep a fire extinguisher nearby
what was more fun was the fact that we got no good tech repair shops nearby
BUT when I went and bought a new one yesterday (in person and all) I did find one and was like "wellllll shit"
depends on what they would have charged obviously
ALSO as a good thing of this
I am now finally getting to a phone using USBC
cus my old one had one of those "kinda is USBC but also isnt" cables with the lil notches
and guess what - that cable's isolation also already had to be fixed with tape
the only reason I switched was bulging battery
if it werent for that I woulda drove that thing til it would not function anymore
its for maaaybe mails, mostly phone calls and sms
emergency calls, your odd ball phone calls
She got him while ganon was drunk horseback riding? Nice
we love 8 to 5 jobs
thats like ISP go be like "be at your appartment between 8am and end of work hours"
just for you to get your internet connected
It doesn’t seem that it’s that much longer than a standard seed
this seed just was a bit of a rail of keys in the end yea
Half of the overworld being barren didn’t help
the true "length" increasers are having more dungons to do or taking away shadow crystal
and the latter is pretty much torture for rando plays
note: do not the north or east
the entire east north and part west field and related was junk?
and I know that might be a silly
but make woth/fool max counts a setting ppl can set
and obviously fix it for race seeds in whats chosen
Very Strong should just be Focused
It like a laser focus that cuts out regions with no remorse
Having dampe as your guide would be awesome lolz
Rubix, hear me out.. death moutain guard
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
also gg yt don't press the wrong button
like follow subscribe and give us your first born
That happen to use the theme that Culex borrowed
Salad for dinner tonight has eggs in it
Salads take forever if you wanna include eggs
hard boiled eggs for what? 🤔
if just by themselves, couldnt you just crack the eggshell on the side
I know you're supposed to boil the eggs for 15 mins after it starts boiling
15 mins is too long, 8-9 and that's pushing it
It depends on how you want the yolk
6 to 7 if you want the eggyolk still soft (obviously preferably then with fresh_eggs)
The shell will always be taboo lolz
totally didnt try to avoid the emote on the word freesh there PrideLaugh
yea - its not a bad emote just when describing somethin I wanna have the word rather then an emote replacing it PrideLaugh
Hey Darkness... are you imprisoning me?
Idk who understood that joke lolz
sadly I did not either lmao, but tbh making jokes that only you get are the funniest
@darkness3827 at some point...listen to One by Metallica :3
Counter for "we're starting soon": 2
idk how these work but I actually made it to the start
You know what would be cool?
Having a mod of just fighting bowser
Are those the chapters you have to do?
why are you wearing a waweegee outfit?
Feli is Phan's good luck charm
have you already forfeited? having goombario is just too much
well at least we'll never have to see goombario again
that dang flower.. never gives me anything good.
Goombario makes me think of goombella and I get frustrated
Goombella got turned into a mean brat in the remake
isn’t she a brat In the original?
Yeah but she wasn't a mean brat
She's a bully in the remake. Even a guy pointed out she's more exaggerated in the remake
I’m gonna have to check that later
time bring our new child to the volcano
Ok you are in go mode :)
I might...sleep to your stream for a bit...I'm a bit dizzy
Sir game give me a Watt upgrade
You think an earthquake happens when gourmet guy lands?
Jeez just the grubba keys and chapter 6 stuff huh
The only partner you ever need for combat
I love doing math in my Mario game
At least it's not 7??? phanto274Smile
you are PLANNING? So this is a PLANDO, after all??? gmonStare
If the dirt is here too hoo boy
At least you don't have to double dip this nonsense
I just got bored of not being able to glitch and quit it
hey hey! good luck phanto274GL I just got off work
what was that in the hut?
ok, thought i saw something on the ground.
Does Merlow have something? Or nah
This is a crap seed :/
Is this the one for N64?
How was the TP seed yesterday?? I ended up missing the stream </3
I know NOTHING about this game or what’s happening phanto274Smile
hold up... how did he attack before your partner did?
the turn before last, you attacked bowser and he hit you and knocked you out. he attacked before Bow did
i don't use out of sight so i didnt know that
Yeah outta sight eats her next turn
I just caught a shiny lickitung phanto274GG
Does it auto-reveal spoiler once everyone finishes?
whats the best settings if you wanna mess around with this games rando without ever playing it before lmao
Yeah, we were kinda short in damages here
Yeah, not gonna get thirsty for a new pair of shoes XD
all your BP or nothing LUL
Did you went on Danger mode Phantom ?
Didn't want to spend too much time looking for 25 shards.
I went with 20 hp, so didn't had to calculate.
Well, GGs again, sleep time for me now :-P
OOH for 1 coin you can buy a coin!
like, the two other people who didn't DNF?
because if that's the case that sounds rough
Goombario just kills you in this seed
Bombette's like, "Mario pls give me a break"
and now she's been rewarded for that job
now that she's upgraded maybe she can blow everything up in one try now!
now Kooper's like, "Hey Mario my Fright Jar! I thought you were gonna get it!"
"he'll be back any minute, I just saw him go into the woods behind my house"
Mario will go back and get it for him, in a couple hours once he's killed Bowser.
pay 2 coins for 1 coin!
take a coin, leave 2 coins
buy that coin then you will!
I was also wondering why it was slowly getting slower
parakarry with the swag reverse deliver
i didnt even know you could do that
the only fun thing I know about bombette's ability is that the trees have separate hitboxes for the bomb and a couple of them in Toad Town are in the wrong spot. But neither are necessary to hit sadly.
I finished it... 9 freaking hours of hunting for berries lol
anyone eles realize how weird kirby commercial were
my go mode was nanab berry, the chain was elite 4 trainers check giving dive > seafloor cavern devon goods > slateport grunt nanab berry
I enjoyed my time but not doing that again, berry are thrown into the filler pool. It would have to change to do that again
like for the kirby 64 commercial the put kirby in a pet adoption center
did the slide make you dodge the lightning or did it still hit?
that must be master quest wacka then lmao
who is your favorite partner in the paper mario series
fp plus can create lighting now
btw, when I finished there were only 37 checks left lol
i'm back from deadpool and wolverine
I was able to gen it without hidden items thankfully
ive done hidden items a few times so im more open to it
also I crossed over 100 hours of emerald rando
its used for stop n swap
so its just the collectors version of shop points form ttyd
thank god this isn't vanilla yeah
wonder how many years it would take the crash the game using Bombette LUL
i love ttyd's fire drive bagde
you know you can just use your hammer to hit the trees /s
glad i could teach you something about this game
looks like someone already did tbh
oh youll get a kick outta this, while playing the seed I found a safari ball outside of the safari zone KEKW
Cooltrainer Marcel on Route 121 stole it LUL
it’s what she was sipping on before you showed up
is this gonna be the run with no hammer in logic
know what the funny part is?
the safari zone IS ON ROUTE 121 KEKW
final bowser decided to be a jerk
I just realized I should have used close call
oh wait close call was like 8 BP nevermind KEKW
If you wanted to, you could do right side blue station with Clippy IIRC
You can jump on the spring and jump up I think
i looked away and looked back, thought you were about to fight anti guy
I thought it was last time it came up but was wrong, you do need jump
kooper jump dont help with that 1 item on the left spring block either?
Okay, it's that you jump on the spring and then jump while walking down
if you could, how would you get back out
that's actually not a bad music for the game over screen
does sleep stomp work on this boss?
so.... you out of this room?
or the one with the blocks and shit
dafuq why is starbeam a findable item
^ forever because bowser would never admit to doing good even if he does
brb gonna go work for bowser RAILED
damn, needed that 25 minutes ago
How fitting, she got lost in her own basement
Yep, E.Gadd and Luigi were here to do their work
I got you and someone else open with respectively rando
both of ya getting good shit rn being like "what the fuck"
what is this, rando cursing time? PrideLaugh
6 dmg for 8 FP. Not worth. phanto274Cry
if a redeem a rando can i pick all the settings
where can i see those lol
Is that a feesh on a pillar
Did you just get twink in the chest?
i imagine you wouldnt want to do glitched logic right lol
HOLD you never said no logic
its mostly the race settings, but i added all the bugs
and also all dungeons :) but theres keysy
The purple coins. Nooo~ We need those to get the power stars for the comet observatory. phanto274Cry
Is Watt in the library then?
I have a shift from 11 - 8 tomorrow give me motivation to not end all
cause I'm the only one whos available in the afternoon cause school starting back up
Frying Pan was a powerful gatekeep this seed
give to Axl and rig to race
I'm glad you finally fixed that before there was issues with it where I clicked it and it said I "wasn't first" which is silly
Anyone wants to make a funny prediction on which is the first item of the seed
Since every one of them is in play
At least it shows the nickname it didn't leak anything with that page up LOL
gonna get doxxed live on the phatnom stream
Think I'll go make some tea before I get my dinner
How boring, free pointy thing boo
I suppose mandatory PoT means it's a full sword hunt
How long do you think this one will take?
2 swords hopefully in random spots
what is this poe per mario?
First real item ball and chain
is there also an “only keydoors” setting?
i wouldnt expect the church to hold that type of thing…
I need me a dom rod Sadge
i’m glad we all think the same thing when we hear “dom rod” phanto274Smile
Good luck Phantom! You look really cool
All this golden bait for the fishing rod
ITS THE THING THAT GOES ON COOKIE SHHEYS
HOW DOES HE NOT KNOW WHAT PARCHMENT PAPER IS
It pretty much loops to if you like exploration or not
You'd think so, but many people complain about exploring in some oot hacks KEKW
I was about to say lol
Not good but better than nothing
Twitch app is sooooo dogshit that i jist got the notification
Have a feeling this will be a long one
Feels weird to have poes off KEKW
Swords 2 wild one hinted, ability to do lakebed temple and boomerang
Like I'm guessing you'll be lucky to find one thing of value here at this temple
You should totally have a separate timer for all dungeons lolz
Link from ALTTP-"I want a Mirror"
this is the part of the stream where Axl barges in and says "Hey Phantom! how cursed is Feli's seed?"
One sword and the ability to enter lakebed temple and a clawshot for go
Wow you barely won that, impressive stuff
How many dungeons do you normally play with out of curiosity/ how many do races require?
Okay so this is like double the seed depending on which dungeons get rolled
Who needs a horse just ride this spinning roomba of death for speed
I can see how abusive this is but it's hella funny
Why can't I herd with this spinning roomba beyblade of death
I never knew there was a hole here
Just invest into a few good herding dogs instead
stairs in tp are weird lol
i feel like the have the sm64 problem, where some stairs are just slopes and some are actual stairs
like for the hit box lol
Just golden bait for the fishing rod, sorry Agatha
i think i put the pot on the very edge
How did you do that?? evo17Wut
I mean... if there's nothing else needed then I'd say finish it
You ever got any hints from any of them?
Ah spiders. No longer kill it with fire. Now it's shoot it with bomb arrows
Just a sword and sky characters left
Now it's just the ability to get to Argorok and not have a shitty battle
I’m thinking this’ll be sub 5
I could never make that jump between those 2
The uh... levers in the room with the switches lolz
Quickly being narrowed down to just sword mode most likely
Shit here we go again... more exhaustion coming
It's like almost 8...I probably won't be able to sleep
I mean the only thing keeping you from skipping is the sword and book being anywhere
I meant to ask this before but I never did. Is Chucky a cuddly cat?
I hope he purs a lot ohheyi30UWU
Always remember that you're your cat's servant
he makes you work for it LOL WELL IF THAT AIN'T A DAMN CAT ohheyi30Hehe
Dogs will always regard you as alpha unless you're dealing with a Husky
wait, have you ever seen Teen Girl Squad before?
have you seen any Homestar Runner stuff?
I haven’t played this game in a minute now that I think about it
I posted the video it refers to whenever you wanna take a look at it PrideLaugh
I put a low amount of points in the hopes that I win and win big
100x100, yeah I'll take that PrideLaugh
Not in a betting mood because I'm too busy trying to concentrate on what I'm cooking with
I did that on Curtis' channel before and won 100k or something like that
Don't want to burn what I'm cooking
oh hey the guy from Hyrule Warriors KappaPride
I say ice block puzzle gonna take about...2 mins
Hey I was gonna say 5 lolz
thank god it showed you where the weak point is
how else will you remember what a blue rupee is worth?
it’s like pot of greed. nobody knows what it does.
our balls are on the line here
So it's time to finally finish this long winded seed
How vanilla of the boss reward
Wait... don't you need all 4 swords?
I think he needs the light one for twilight but I don't even remember too much now
Ball and chain locked 2 swords
I wonder why castle town people are afraid of wolf link... he's just a giant dog basically
So basically Wolf Link is more like Husky+GSD mix Link
Because breeding Wolf into a dog tends to make them aloof
What did that say...I missed it
And now a boring old vanilla escort mission
Alert vanilla incoming.  Duck if you hate vanilla
I thought that was your plan
I called sub 5 earlier phanto274Smile
Totally forgot about that right until now and then realized you had to do it in the speedrun all the time
The only time in the whole series where Ganon is a girl
He just possesses Zelda like no problem
Zelda just rolls over to Twilight Ganon
The only time that Ganondorf could be the 99% default gender of his race
I mean... if she didn't send all her power to midna... he wouldn't have been able to
Yeah true, basically she gave up the triforce of Wisdom to Midna to keep her alive
At that point she was just a shell
She still had the ability to make Light Arrows and such. Not like she had 'nothing'
Ganondork having the blood of the goddess would be a scary thing to behold if he could properly use that with him being the physical incarnation of Demise's curse
Well after defeating ganon in beast form... everything goes back to zelda and she's alive again
The devil and God in one body
it must be my fault cause you're 0/3 since I started watching you :(
Basically I help take care of people that can't take care of themselves
Like getting dressed, going to the bathroom, and showering
I did see a man's penis today
timeout ganon i gotta drink my fairy juice, pls stay stunned for an extra few sec
someone should change that laugh to Tidus' lmao it's kinda similar
Fuck, gotta make my lunch for tomorrow
Ball and Chain was the first item and it locked both swords behind it
I'm telling you...should place your all dungeons in it's own lolz
Well last time you got 7 hours lolz
is this that zelda maker game you were talkin bout before?
Always the best to start with
Oh it's 3D world? Sounded like the observatory lolz
also the song is called "Champion's Road" that's more of a Pokemon thing lmao
I mean I know Mario stuff. This didn't sound like Pokémon either
Wait that says guest? I thought it said quest
i never beat it Sadge actually i never even play much of the game KEKW
i played the demo a little bit
I never played this but I know stories of this
Tiger I think you meant Temu
can you repeat? ads were on
Zelda Classic but Minish cap edition
these slimes are pissing me off LMAO
arent there other characters you can play as
I don't like these slimes lmao
can you edit enemies health or is it just always the same?
We just started and I'm already lost
there is a whirlwind behind the pole
I have never seen this game in a discord call before
hit more grass maybe??? idk what else you could try
I'm gonna go ahead and dip
are these supposed to be roguelike?
now time to bring that to the other dungeon!
yeah these vertical ones are a bit unfair cause of how little you can see
I do want to try this. People being creative with dungeon making is good to me lmao
low to high, so it would be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C
what in the bullet hell is going on here lmao
Maybe helps with the music room
there was a Fire Rod in the music room, wasn’t there?
you left it when you got the boomerang
I saw one behind the chest where you got the bombs.
yo phantom and chat. this is a cool looking zelda isk game
finally money is useful for something
oh jeez a horde of dark links
Oh man that was not what I expected lol
yeah I think it'd be fun
do we make the dungeons on pc?
would be fun to recreate some classic zelda dungeons and come up with some new ones
for a zelda rip off its doesn't looks bad
i would create. puzzle dungeons are fun to make.
I would watch this too, would scratch the minish cap itch lol
i have a couple levels on mario maker 2. best two levels are an auto level and a puzzle level. for some reason, the auto level has a low clear rate.
I'd personally wait for the campaign mode first
mkay. i wouldnt mind a chance to win/earn a code. would be fun making levels again
yeah I'm really curious bout making levels for it
I’ve made a few miscellaneous levels in this, it’s pretty cool
the dev adds new stuff every week on Friday or Saturday
This game has some definite charm
yeah that final hit seemed very jank
the last hit isn’t too bad if you know what to do and practice it
make a massive dungeon that utilizes 4 of the passive items and a main weapon
cn you pair that up with the sail cloth too?
if you do a rolling jump with a feather on a 5 speed conveyor belt you can jump like a 9 or 10 block gap
ok im sold. ima have to get this and start making levels
will the shovel dig up the mud?
I think the biggest think is more enemies. Also being able to create a whole world would be super cool. I have some ideas but yeah more tools would be super neat.
yeah custom overworlds is on their roadmap
man could you imagine having an island and set up the over world for it and a dungeon
I'd love to create like a 4-5 dungeon world with overworld areas.
yeah prob gonna get this game at somepoint
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
i remember when megaman maker came out
First qual is in 9 days
waut lemme get my phone instead
I immediately forgot to go on my phone
Hey Dark...did you ever listen to One?
Have you tried skyward sword randomizer?
@AnniLyn2 Yeah, I think I musta hearrd it once or twice before cause it definitely sounded super familiar but not enough for me to remember the lyrics ig lmao.
How do capture footage from your wii and keep it in 4x3 aspect ratio?
@darkness3827 if you've ever played Guitar Hero 3 then probably yeah
Does your capture card take component or hdmi input?
Yo Phantom are you still using a Sensei 10 mouse? Looking for a new mouse and was looking at the 10 do you reccomend?
yoo why is zel zelda wearing a purple thing
@zuletassonn Zelda always wears some kind of purple/pink dress
whats your reasoning for the sensei 10? im not really tech savvy so im curious what makes this one special
ooh ok yeah thats sounds like a worth investment
i keep going for cheap ones and saying "eh i guess i can just get another one later" KEKW
im in Canada so stuff is a bit more expensive but feels better to get soemthing thats gonna last
I was wondering if you've done any entrance randomizer pokemon runs, and/or if you had an interest in doing one.
I just happened to see the settings on archipelago and wanted to ask
I went downstairs to clean dishes...what did I miss?
Well I didn't miss that xD
Rain says he needs whatever the bot is smoking xD
geez he takes more than 3 hits? wtf zelda that's not how bosses work.
i didnt realize that they could have defense
instead of just increasing his health
wow really!? how do people find this out grimmp4Lol
can you get here without the master sword normally?
You didn't bonk on nothing lolz
You still bonked into the wall lolz
Omg if it's in here...I'd be mad for you
In twilight's hush, where shadows blend,   A hero’s path will darkness end.   Through realms of dusk and silent plea,   A princess waits for dawn to be.    With courage fierce and heart so true,   The light breaks through, the sky turns blue.   In Hyrule’s tale, a dawn will rise,   As twilight fades from darkened skies. Cheer100
Yeah I think you got the second Dom in city
I just remembered this is a race and I can't ask if you've been to a certain area
i just search every check lantern locked
so DCS on path to BnC
but i didnt get the hint to and its a sometimes not an always
no the only always are Goronspringwater/iza1/plumm/ice puzzle/shellblade
Where did you find the second clawshot?
Thanks Val....I guess that's the lantern hint
and for the 5th seed in a row i did argorock with Ordon sword ....
at least it happens during training
boom is in the first check in SPR
and if i did star2 before going to CITS (wich i though for a moment) i would have done SPR first
thats how it goes sometimes i guess
at least it didnt happen in a qualifier
you showed us saturday that you are a good contestant
anyway gg and have a good night
Wait the points can expire? Wut
yo Phantom how’d the race go?
Like a "go to your room" kind of bad
Oof, pizza will make it better FeelsOkayMan
Idk if he'll let me get bread twists lolz
Sorry Phan :( I just realized I've been saying "he"
can’t be worse than your old place, those delivery stories were wiiiiiiiiild
is master quest for steam only?
i did hence why im asking
have no idea how difficult that is
creating a level? idk it seemed no harder than making a Mario Maker level, it's mainly just about can you create a good level or not lmao.
I hate it when fuccking sand is in vanilla
you can also have multiplayer in the dungeons
I’m much too uncreative to design a level, best I could do is recreate a Zelda level
also shoutouts to disgaea mouse pad
basically just mario maker 2 for zelda
im gonna make a dungeon or two
a free game sounds cool but I lack the attention span for level design
Disgaea is fun, wonder if randos exist for any of those games lmao.
for Phantom to program a randomizer? lmao I don't think one exists
I've been messing around making a dungeon with oot decomp
oh yeah, oot modding has come a long way
ooh OoT dungeon making sounds fun af.
its not easy still since you need allot of knowledge, but its fun
but there "is" a BN6 rando
brb, looking for your youtube vod KEKW

so using that in risch's stream tomorrow LUL
I started completing the TP cheevos
its just the boss challenges rly
like fighting fyrus clanker style only
fyrus you can combine at least
morpheel is just a double entry
dude I love when my first arrow on fyrus despite being same angle always just whiffs
what the fuck am I doin 🤣
anyhow - yea some will just take a bit
its the first grab on fyrus which is harsh I feel like rly only if you wanna combine the 3 arrow damageless with clanker whle fight
iron boots mortal draw I reckon
yea so you do the entire climb each reset
given I am ooccoo'ing before each major fight rn in dungoens
cus that also means a 15s cutscene on top of safe reload
in the pond ya mean yea
I will fiddle with that after cave and shit when I can do heart pieces
I mean I have not played boat much at all
it will be huge patchworking out a solution
but if I find anything obv. I will tell
except at least you can safe right before you do it
but you can bet I have speedup bound to controller now
fuck watching the same safe reload every couple minutes all slow and shit
like - I am glad that speed up is okay with hardcore mode given some of the shit you have to do
I just coulda had the double fyrus cheevo cleanup
and got cucked by iron boots giving me the shortest finisher jump I have seen EVER
but link wanted to stab the floor
and tried to sidehop close, but regrabbed my Z
brain stuck in N64 target button naming
but I know now I had it basically twice
meaning easy, just couple more tries right phanto274Smile
okay, being stepped on by fyrus indeed does do damage, I was assuming that but didnt have it happen
but also man why did it take me 10 tries to get that double
only works ironless though I reckon
cus otherwise no way you have the movement
also apparently diababa doesnt have a 3heart cheevo cus "haha lmao ofc"
love also how the marked as missable on Retroachievements does NOT include the 3heart boss fights
how much was the initial bomb bag, 120?
so conveniently too expensive for baby wallet to get hylian and that PrideLaugh
I should know this given rando but oh well
looking for BN5 maps I see terra started to update them but never finished. He stopped at scilab 2
wanted to say, you can have snappy menus on 30 too
would be nice if the menus were snappier, agree
feels like you have to wait forever to pick anything in battle
sounds like they matched menu to animations rather then the animations to the menu then
have they watched a single run in the last decade?
“time to ignore everything that has come before me”
amish, have you ever seen a BN6 run?
I think I’ve seen a couple, don’t you pause and it resets the encounter timer?
I don’t get those people at all
but also - yea especially if its an older game, look around for routes is not bad at all :D
Ah what’s the actual strat? I remember seeing that section but not enough to know
to be fair, when I did Astral Chain I didnt look at any resources but that was for the 24 hour challenge
oor was it 12 hour? i dont remember
how do you draw lines on your maps?
Oh that’s right I remember seeing that now
all the games have you switch to Lan in the first scenario. Oven Comp, Gas Comp, Principle Comp, Radio Comp, Main Comp, and School Comp
I'd love being able to reset step count in any game with random encounters tbh :D
bn2 has a ton of ways to reset step counts
when sneakrun and locate enemy runs out, talking to cubes, talking to monitors in plane comps, talking to ice, there is a lot
yeah there's nothing I hate more than a puzzle/maze dungeon with random encounters. It's like oh how do I figure this out *BOOM ENCOUNTER* now I have to spend like 15 sec remembering wtf I was doing before the encounter.
Ive made it thru plane comps with only 3 sneakruns and no encounters
it's never a good jack in time when you're streaming.
I think you mean Beta Swrd KEKW
Crazy to me how much slower boss battles seem in BN 1
as someone who played a ton of TCGs, ya clearly gotta work on your draw skills
On a scale from 1 to 10 my friend youre fucked. In lack of other words id say youre fucked. You are as they say in japanese, fucked from the head down to the knees I am sorry to inform you. You are fundementally fucked.
I heard that on twitter today but it had a cute jingle with it KEKW
idk what is going on in this game but i like the part where you rollerblade everywhere
this is why all games need unskipable cutscenes, so speedrunners are forced to show us all the lore
thats something I thought you already knew that LUL
I have no clue what that means or how it effects gameplay but neat?
i wanna be done with these damn maps, ive only done 3 phanto274Smile
Its wild II saw my first BN Speedrun over 10 years ago
it was good play lies of p and lol
Also about the romhack, uh, don't
Nah it's not bad, it's just not all people will like how much damage some enemies do
It's more the target crowd it's intended for, casuals will drop it like midway lol
I already saw in the romhack server several fuck you for different parts KEKW
the wapon mecanik is the good point
I dont recommend the gamecube blutooth dongle I use
I do, cause you can remap your controls
so since I said I finished 3 maps, ive only diid the map for drill comp 2. This is gonna take longer than I thought
so I wanna say it was a mistake not to have hawkeye for the cart defense
specifically just to snipe a couple things out - it is manageable without
yo gl phantom, pax badge arrived today
am referring to fireless cart defense there, not "just" defending the cart obv.
it's a "yes i can be in these areas" badge
ah yeah, i gotta figure out how pricey parking will be, it's like a 15ish min drive for me
you gotta see my drill comp 3 map LUL
yeah but it's all highway so it's like, not reasonable to walk or bike KEKW
the fishing for all fish can be done in fishing pond without troubles right
as in no story flag shenanigans
nah, south, i'm close to the airport
yea I know about the journal being ez that way
but if there's the pond stuff anyway, I wont cheap out I dont think
NODDERS i'm not far from white center at all, i can drive through there getting to work if bridges are up
my plan rn is to LJA the rupee chest at kak gorge owl, over to iza for that cus bomb bags arent locked by cheevos last I recall
and then I AM ALREADY THERE
My plan right now is to go fuck myself widepeepoHappy
This game really does say fuck you
phanto274GG still a fun stream night
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
jokes on you, this game has no filenames
hope all is well phantom, also I hope my silly dm splosion on a certain fishShy JoelNOPERS was oky
workin on some Quest Master rn it's pretty fun
the new emotes are looking clean
my favorite is the nomb with BRB over the face KEKW
wait the go live message said tp seed?
surely you get to power plant again Kappa
if ya did look into tthe loach derps of mine phantom: I hope it helps PrideLove
I will obviously have to go back and catch one more of it, but it feels like what I described to ya is the most you can get on "consistency"
like - I spent about 90minutes or so on it I think? and that was for one
and in your case, you might also need a new safe cus if you caught one already at max size, it may just enver work for the thing
strimer your title says "for fun" but I thought speed runing was strictly pain and agony ?
so - unrelated to fishing and fishing holes with seasons right
you got any tips for blizzetta damageless
specifically after 4th ball swing rly yea
obviously if nothin comes to mind its fine PrideLaugh like surely I'd figure a "1 time it works" out by retries
just like how it was quite "fun" to figure out the toad
good thing the slingshot does deal with the small fry
so in theory you can stock up ammo just for tht, and deal with the small ones by back paddling and ranged with 1 spin right when they fall
my silly brain didnt want to waste ammo though
earlier today I did a TP seed with Anni, nothing crazy happened really but I only playeed to 3rd dungeon cause I had other stuff to do
and like - I would guess even, that darknut with clankers on throughout is arguably less problematic then its made out to be
I had the same laughing reaction lol
oh I forgot about smog... takes me back
also didnt think you knew smog
do you remember which TTS I said id use for Risch?
you speak Japanese? or you just raw dogging it
i heard best of luck solider
oh sorry i thought you would need to speak or read Japanese in order to play a game in Japanese
how do you do japanese number doors?
I wish we could sell our chips for zenny in this game
OOOO did I come into a successful run
that... is silly imo but oh well
I guess ppl rly did grind this game then
RNG manip is neat but makes for a vastly different run
You can manip everything--when you get an encounter, what encounter you get, etc.
it does sound very learnable at least
not as much reset heavy then
past skill / execution I mean
like - you're not resetting for good espeons or quils
There's like one part where you do want to chain an RNG manip for a few minutes.
if you mess that up, you redo the whole section
any% is cool the first time you watch it, cant say more beyond that
uh I forget the exact number but around then
its like watch ACE to me, "oh thats cool"
like - its very "execution resets only" and party trick-ish
the good bit of how that sounds like?
you're not on RNG hell in a sense
I wanna see you S rank sharkman KEKW
BN3 often uses draw manips or like Wind * manip.
BN4+ are functionally unmanippable due to saving RNG state to SRAM.
bn2 is the hardest to manip out of the 3
when I was testing controls in BN5 thee other night EVERY AREA gave me a bugfrag. I had 4 before Colonel KEKW
aaanyhoo - after now sittin here and mostly just vibin, I guess I finally should try blizzetta again
yesterday I was just plain too tired for it PrideLaugh
when was the last time you played 5?
is it that different from 6?
there is a tail cannon i guess
i thought it targeted panels randomly
i remember risch got a used bn6 cart and tried to beat gregar without looking at the folder. It had not a single charge chips LUL
isnt neovari a PMD in end area?
ok I am not likin myself
I just had a blizzeta with 14 ball throws
it rly was more my positioning
pronyo talking about hard coding random text for april fools KEKW
wild that you got the 1 out of 100 chance
do you know about the mystery data megaman cant decode?
its one time items you already picked up, but when you jack in it respawns
always thought it would be funny to see Lan infront of the doghouse with a fishing rod
How are you losing against stone man?
need 145k more zenny and I am officialy done with MMBN1
i get 50k every time I go there
found a site selling new gamecube smash controllers
seems like a good idea to get extras while I can
its in CAD for 64.99 and 65.00 is for free shipping so I may get 2 for the free shipping lol
i hacked my switch and i'm playing yokai watch 4 lol
the first was okay, they really got better with each installment
the battle system in 4 is pretty cool honestly
question, can I cheat and get the style changes at the beginning of the game in MMBN2?
or do I have to wait
i think i'll cheat engine it
i want wood shield, hub, and I don't know what my third style will be
wood shield is cracked for casual play
shield levels the fasted and just reg treebomb
i think my third style will likely be custom but I don't know what element
looking something up on an old komari vod and he got hosted KEKW
kind of glad it isn't anymore
too many times have I been in a chill stream
and then they host someone that has their music set to 300%
I did like streams that would host GDQ cause they were more lax on the rules
i miss when GDQ was batshit crazy and there were almost no rules
so...are you doing a Yai cosplay ? :)
Man can you imagine if your oven or fridge was plugged into the internet? Such a wild concept
not that wild, I was at bestbuy and someone was playing pokemon showdown on a fridge
@Axl_SR trying to catch a shiny ice pokemon probably
my mind runs to "attack of the show" but I know that doesnt match up LUL
plus your HP doesnt even heal between fights
ratty's are always the worst viruses
don't you love how they introduced this fight right after a grueling fight?
I was trying to get area grab R in BN3 earlier since I’m on blue and can only get 1 * code
are you as hyped as I am for MMBN7?
Let it be known, on the record, that I called it
capcom asked which megaman do you want to see more o
starforce had a better story, but terrible combat for sure
i wish capcom would keep making MMBN games like Activision makes COD games
yo Phantom, phanto274GG on the big PB/completed run earlier!
it seems really annoying to have to collect a certain amount of or chips when some of them are rng to drop
isn't there a kid that trades a longsword away?
but you also had to fight woodman and all the others too don't you?
Oh man, buster doing 5 feels massive in this game too
Goodnight everyone, have a good one!
its cold outside for once so very happy
im losing it over here! I just heard someone call Decidueye a "Deck A Duey" and I fucking cant phanto274S
last night I did a BN3 rando, so happy i found body guard lol
@Axl_SR That's what they're called when you have 10 of em LUL
i couldnt get bn5 going and it was getting late
also my gamecube controlllers arrived today
Oh no what'd I do now!?
so I now have 3 sealed gamecube controllers,2 sealed brawler 64 controllers, 2 sealed Switch SNES controllers, and 1 sealed Pokken controller lol
excuse me? You go to tracking and unmark show all locations. So what are they asking for?
how does the tracker know what is out of logic tho?
pay attention!? I can't do that!
you dont even care about pop tracker anyways so sure why not
yeah, I agree with that. Like when you ported over BN3 and emerald to emotracker you didnt change anything.
I prob wouldve said something to JKB but thats me
that does not answer my question
purple, cause your layout has been that for a while plus you match the pape hud with it too lol
im adding you to my tomodachi island
btw i have seen bots using turkish letters to get pass block terms
chat would you say phantom is quirky or normal
ok so ban bot copy paste to add to terms
wasnt i the horse or something
im gonna say "pretty normal" then
also i didn't know mods could add block terms
Phanotm is an "easygoing - dreamer" according to Tomodachi
OMG, that is so funny the pape channel called out BN3 KEKW
somehow im reminded of when i played totk it imported my botw horses and i forgot i named my horses all kinds of dutch swearwords
i have a async ap coming up and i am doing 5 seeds AAAA
so what are hint points exactly?
i have bought stuff in shops for pape for hint points before
letters still count i think and koot when they are off
Im just glad you showed how to edit the tracker so now I dont have to bug you about every little thing.
like I even combed thru emerrald and locally gave it berry and trainer logic
so for these number checks are the first 2 always the same and the rest are random or semi-random?
gl with the run or runs
also I am happy for I did complete the cheevo set on TP
and MAN was I pissed when the spider puree came active AFTER I was in temple of time KEKW
had to go back via new savefile just for that
did you have the time or will to look into the fishing stuff or nah?
also if they get an overworld map they could just mark it there what is out of logic
like if ch3 is excluded just right on the box and done
new pape rando maptracker setup stuff thought that?
oh hey, i can now redeem vip KEKW
the good thing? at least they KNOW your maptrackers are good
the bad thing? they should git gud
its not hard to do that via simple checkbox
and I have NOT had the pleasure of actual coding in like 4 years
but thats SUCH a "just read up, git gud, done"
Yo Phantom, glad to hear you’re feeling better and gl on the runs todays! phanto274GL
sorry for diggin into already cold noodles there PrideLaugh
just - a) ignore what you dont need to do
look at how wooferz for WWR did that AAAAGES ago
like - its not witchcraft lmfao
In Battle Network’s realm where battles roar,   Drawing escape is but a distant shore.   Trapped in a grid of ceaseless strife,   No path to flee from the digital life.   In every clash, the chains are tight—   Escape eludes in the endless fight. Cheer100
like - AP should just get fed auto junk based on it and done
again: look at how WWR poptracker does it
do you still get hint points for hitting that multi coin block?
what I then not get rightt
is why they dont just make it be a 10 pack of coins
and turn the multi coin blocks into QoL'd normal blocks
and respectively single coin blocks as well
yeaaa, BUT you get what I mean
and I am specifically talking about the AP implement
the AP devs do have access to that, no?
i should get emudeck working on my steamdeck
gimme a sec my hair is annoying
so only pape devs have access to the pape rando code is the gist of it?
would it be an issue for them to ask to fork it for that purpose though
as cool as that sonic collection is I honestly dont care about most of that shit, $250 is a huge ask, you could buy a switch for that price
how many closed source randos are there I wonder...
thats.... rough for this in a sense
though at the same time like
I dont get why for AP specifically its an issue then
outside POV, so please pardon my french there: as much as I respect it, that just smells of bad shenanigans talk
it also took a while to get the ball rolling for them to be open to the idea of it being on AP
and in terms of how AP poptracker for pape handles that further: my guess as to why it handles itself the way it does is bc of actively reading where the items are and translating that to the tracker
rather then just checkbox based seting toggles, done
which should then fix all the possible spoils talk
why not just accept that for actual racing, you go for the standalone Pape implement and done deal
cus to me, AP Rando has TONS of "yea this could be an issue for official races" vibes
if ONLY for the console you have to be connected to
any reason for number 274 for your emotes?
I have not, but also like - to me its more a "look we can have it in AP because AP"
you have to connect it to something
yeah for affiliates the emote names are just like the first 6 letters then numbers if there are duplicates.
when the prefixes already exist, they put in a number to make it unique
and it use too be not like that
that must have been changed then
tippiShrug as said. I dont see no issue with that step as long as you accept that with pape in AP, you just dont try to race w it
phantom gotta hit partner for a unique prefix
cause it wasnt like that when I was play testing AP seeds on console beforre it went multiworld
cus you can easily just - you know - accept a standalone rando for standalone seeds / solo seeds gets used over AP
I really dont see the problem there
and like - I overall get your point, I just dont see where that interferes if that makes sense
they couldn't just you know click on the tracker
I may get a new laptop this week... old one died and my wallet is crying now
@blacktiger51 autotracker =/= user input required
as someone who's never played the game why did that end the run and what were you supposed to do differently?
so it just woulda taken forever got it
a 2h run, gosh, how painful is rng?
you pause on the frame the fight starts to skip it
ive been struggling with early key in bn5
anyway - what I then gather so far: just accept AP not being solo rando for Pape, done deal in the easy way
and the long winded way? figure out with the pape dev team how the boots should work
and for the tracker, look at stuff like WWR
and obscure the info to the tracker by settings boxes
Honestly, not sure what other problems you have with Pape AP (besides BizHawk) but for me I think the only thing that would be nice to have would be an indication when items have been received and when they're done
Phantom did you see the Nintendo Museum stuff?
You can play Wii games with a giant Wii remote
just for standalone seeds its iffy
Yeah waiting is rough but I get that some of it's limited on the mod side, I think indication would mitigate it a bit
Me when pinged at 10 am
Ima hit the hay, gamescom season is upon us and that's so much pain for us who are on the business side... talk to you tomorrow
they COULD as said just obscure some data from server to client via the settings which are selected before seed roll
if only that would stop the gremlins phantom KEKW
you assume that people can read
the promblem is the people who would ping you are never gonna read that lmao
speaking of pointless ping in a discord you dont use dont mind me @everyone'ing for giant ds
that sounds too simple, what if I submit something in a horrible way?
the thing is you think people will even read that
cus I mean - look at what I had done before you ported the Pape pack for Emotracker / your legacy webpage over to poptracker KEKW
like - I therefore also kinda fall into that gremlin pool KEKW
make it a pop up window every time they open the tracker KEKW
again: I kinda fall into the gremlin pool, so to an extent I get where the gremlin brain might come from
I needa figure out how paper mario works at some point, seems interesting to play
I'm gonna ping u 11 times tomorrow morning
I used emo tracker and was real confused with the map tracker
On the topic of weird discord users. Someone in the Rando discord joined today and asked to talk to the owner so they could be made mod LUL
anyway: again! - sorry for when the pape tracker came to be for poptracker, I was gremlin in a sense then too
That's exactly how you become mod for sure
and arguably worse as much as you had been thinkin about porting it and being done with it at that point PrideLaugh
but phaaaaantom, thats being prepaaaaared for an uuuupdate
their reasoning for wanting to be a mod is they like Goomballa, and she is totally in that game Kappa
so the usual telephone game really
just saying "look its telephone game FUN"
that's how you do it! Always add to the top LUL
YOU AD TO THE END OF AN ARRAY
YOU ADD TO THE END OF AN ARRAY!
is that part of the randomizer??? picking where in the array the check goes!?
AN ARRAY USED FOR DATA DOESNT HAVE TO BE ALL NEAT AND TIDY FOR WHERE DATA IS
and I 100% get where that stupid sentiment comes from
BUT IT MUST BE ALPHABETICAL ORDER OR ELSE EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE ANARCHY AND NOTHING MATTERS!
Sounds like they do it on purpose lmao, why would they even fo it that way
have you EVER heard of that silly game called 7 days to die?
PC game now available on consoles, was in Early access for 10 years?
well there's some times where maybe it's reasonable. BUT NOT CAUSE I'M TOO STUPID TO PUT THINGS AT THE END OF AN ARRAY!
have you heard how they look at that? KEKW
for reference: since like 5 years ago, its a sentiment of "oh yea TFP (the fun pimps, company name behind that) just broke shit, deal with it"
it was ALWAYS labeled as Alpha
oh i remember that game bought it to play with friends and we never played it once KEKWait
Now a days triple a games releases their alpha versions as full games
TO WHICH THEN IN THE DEV FORUM BLOCK ONE OF THE DEVS SAYS "Axx (so alpha version this and that), 1.0, gold edition dont matter, all water under the bridge" NO IT FUCKING ISNT
EVEN FUCKING EA OR UBISOFT DONT LET THAT FLY
and they break most of their shit
they cant even fucking code Uno at ubisoft
They never saw a fuckin beta and they never fucking will till the day they die :LUL:
but yea no, that whole versioning thing has not changed
its something you literally learn to this day during coding related unless you learn it by doing it
THERE IS A REASON US MONKEY TYPEWRIGHTER PEOPLE CAME UP WITH IT KEKW
and its so that the less PC smart monkey with their typewrighters get what "us smart monkey typewrighters" came up with
which in that case, I for myself need to be excluded from being actual smart cus I didnt have the chance to work in coding much myself
but you get the point / sentiment
reminder to add roll to your folder
and you know at least try to do everything you can to prevent as much breakage as possible.
the beta is quite literally why the emerald AP tracker was / still is so super behind on its settings and shit, I wanna bet on that
like - not even just jokingly
like maybe not adding items to the middle of arrays lmao
I wanna actually fucking bet on that
people for AP at this point just wait for stable to make changes to mappacks IN POST OF AN UPDATE
which then takes a while with silly nonsense like that
43 never works why do you keep trying it Kappa
and I SWEAR ppl like berserker would not do that sort of shenanigans
okay there was that one time last week but thats an exception
I got steamed on that thought
is the fact that with stuff like adding in items into existing lists no matter the type
you dont have to have them human readable
WHY is that a priority over say, fixing up the webpage gen not flashing people
maybe a UI update to get out of the beta minecraft looking launcher
SO EASY THINGS TO MAKE THE FLOW OF USING SOFTWARE EASIER
and I am not asking for like a app based icon scroll thingy
@Axl_SR whenever phantom doesn't start with 43 he gets it 1st try. So clearly he needs to stop :P
just a bit more clean up over pure function
numberman didnt calc his vic condition right
I know of someone who wants to do a mod for their end
also for my personal taste, settings parsing text interpretation shit
WHY is it dependant on specific icons to exist
just fucking string parse that shit, cut out the fluff icons, dont use them in settings names ever, done
literally the easiest thing in the fucking world
text interpretation is semester ONE of coding even before pseudo
with like scratch and shit or whatever you have for drag and drop learn software
yeah I was doing that shit at like 10 lmao
and also a wishful thing someone I talked to brought up when they were doing AP related: launcher-built in settings parsing
aka a little text editor window you can open up or better yet, making it pull how the webpage is getting fed the dataa
and letting you set up a dynamic UI based on those existing elements
so stuff which should be lightweight to do on paper
sorry, gremlin me just was excited about seeing that ban emote tippiTap
but you really shouldnt be scared about UI
its not that much worse then getting a game to fucking run with custom shit
if anything, custom shit in a videogame is like 3 times harder then UI coding
so if you're already shooting for the stars, might as well pitstop on the moon on your way
breaking shit by messing up lists
thats like taking a book about cooking to the arts section of a library
and leaving the librarian to be pissed
thats just pissy / dick move
I dont just pour salt into your coffee either
the entire reason SO many mods were made past it
was that there WAS a good UI to utilize
on the ingame side mind, but still
HOW Many mods hook into that mod / require it
so like - it should not be different here
or players in a modding scene
completely unrelated, my pokeclicker is progressing nicely PrideUwu
(which I also modded with scripts which LOOK NICE, otherwise I would not use them)
and at this point AP is deep enough that a good UI and not breaking basic stuff should be learned
as part of good apworld upkeep
even outside of coding school stuff
you should know that when you put the coke where the sprite goes
yeah there's a lot of companies that are terrible with breaking API changes and they're getting paid tons to like be competent.
and I KNOW I dumbed it down to the silliest example possible
ya dont put the coke where the sprite goes
broom dont go into the toilet
a car doesnt park on the roof
tell a mechanic their wrenches and screw drivers are sorted backwards
they will literally be upset about it for like half a year
or how I know the team talk - which in english goes "There's no I in Team"?
and it's not like it's something where it was very difficult. It's like the most basic thing ever. It just shows their total lack of awareness for how their shit is being used.
"TEAM should not stand for "toll ein anderer machts" " aka "great, someone else does it"
lil german to english crossover of a saying
which in a sense is 2 different sayings, but also like - it very much is referring to the same overall sentiment
a team = a group = work together, be open in communication
and if one part of a team isnt doing that, the other parts will dip on it
or at the least in a usable, stable way which wont get messed with
you dont change how the baseline interface or API handles itself
if at all, you add new hook ins
im back, how much ranting did I miss?
you dont change how existing hooks worked
my gremlin brain loves this type of nonsense rantings, so I am fueling it KEKW
or in this case is not
I AM GLAD we cant share a coffee or some food
we'd BOTH be late if we'd sit down and start talkin like that KEKW
also in the mail I got property tax stuff. My house went down in value by 55K since last year FeelsBadMan
know what? it sure was nice that bn2 made bug frags fixed
I swear if my directly related ppl here dont figure out how to care for their pets
I aint the one to clean up them not dealing with fleas in their cats ;-;
and I KNOW FOR A FACT one of them has them like BAD
whats worse is the cat which has them bad is also the one they were super heavy like "fuck, we cant even hold / pick ths cat up"
but them doing their nonsense ruins it every time
so I really REALLY dont wanna bother
and I am sad about the cat, but also like.... I tried for over 2 years
and after 2 years of them being adamant its their cat, I really dont give to shits
do not worry tippiLove I know I am rambling
run more important than us chatting
doesnt this comp have L button strats?
it's always fun tryna figure out wtf is goin on in these games I've never played that are in Japanese lmao
traffic light comps have been hacked and your friend Mayl is on a runaway bus
looks like me in gargoyle comps LUL
bubble wrap is so good casually
whens the true end boss...door virus?
all this talk about door viruses is making me rember eye divine cybermancy...
not even a mountain dew drop...
I could never speedrun a game this RNG heavy I'd just hate everything about it lol.
its the opposite problem for me
and I keep s ranking them
so, whats your fav battlechip in the series? i like the shadow chips myself. its like an improved invs almost... with the caviet you take damage from cut damage.
if theres rng, think theres a manip for the chip data?
Phantom there is a discussion in morphs chat rn
Do you think a goomba could top?
Damn you got more faith than I do
I may or may not be part of the convo raven is talking about lmao
Cosmo is the usual :) Hope you have some good escape chip rng
Haven't tuned into one of these yet. How goes the attempts?
yeah bn2 single segment is so much nicer
no library data checks, op sneakruns and prism glitch
I love stacking shockwave but yeah invis1 is a nice RNG drop
bad draws really ruin the numberman fight
I thought it was top 4 out of your first 4
maybe youll get paired up with fatkid again LUL
heres hoping for good rng this run
tp... with that abbreviation its hard not to make toilet related jokes~
i never understood why the bloke thought drinking the purple water was a good idea...
they don't have that in the future
... or even just a fire and good old evaporator set ups?
too bad you cant make a folder full of em...
... sorry for the hose down in the water works.
shame this isnt one of the later battlenetworks. airshot plus icemans own ice cubes would be so funny...
what is up with that background, it's so trippy
... just looking at these games make me shudder these days thinking about the smart device craze.
i made some good progress in MMBN2
... you know now that i think of it the battle networks combat system is pretty uncommon. shame its loads of fun
There does need to be an indie company that should start one up
I mean, Link to the Past got a spiritual successor, Blossom Tales
any plans for a MMBN2 speedrun?
number man would prob make a decient dungeon master for a dnd campaighn.
is speedrunning fun for you?... also thats the fastest reset yet ive seen.
cant blame ya on the boredom front. thats how i got into randomizers
any concord players in chat? Dunno why they would decide to release it a day after black myth wukong lol
that sounds like a tightrope walk and a hald
with the oven on fire i wonder if seymores boss is due for dinner there?
never know fireman could be a burn out with his pattern
just curious have you heard about the open netbattle project?
eh i got distracted by a kinder chocolate ad. bad draws? well the invis is somewhat usefull...
mmm sounds like a delicious canned soup indeed. hope your next ones better.
hey theres the escaoes you wanted earlyer...
prob one of the few kills gutsman gets in this series... peoples speedruns.
... you mean i coulda skipped that mess by loosing?
ok after a lengthy swearing session thank you for the information
huh, the bot gave me a stupid thought. channel points can be redeemed for a lot of things... can they be used to trigger an ad break too?
nice to see they allow it. i tend to get a lot of stupid ideas.
... think it will go to thrree?
ghosts weak to stabbing who knew eh?
im kinda jellous how lan can just stop on a dime with those skate shoes.
for merchendising purposes i would say gutsman would make a good paperweight with his stance.
i like how stoneman is basicly rockcube the navi~
arg sharkman... not my fave fight him and that submarine bloke are tedious at times...
eh shockwaves not the worst. and guards allright.
say whats the worst code you think? i would guess x
classic good codes... you mean *?
one improvement i love they added later was the regular chip system, makes program advances so more reliable
run away from the spooky jumpscare.
ah shades of doom wads and their event lines.
sword pee... well thats kinda like an aqua sword...
phantom where do I go to disable the terrible new feature again
They added a button that let's people give you a popup that says COLLAB WITH ME PLEASE
The only way to remove it
Is whitelist it to favs only
Like oh boy the site that just had hate raid issues not terribly long ago wants to add a button to abuse
seems bad features are the name of the day... one i hate is that react panel youtube added that looks like they ripped it outa a adult chatroom the emotes cover the chat windo and sometimes the stream
Twitch had a few good changes this year... and now they're back to shit into the fan
God the mobile app is abhorrent
menuing the app is horrible and there's 0 customization to the UI that just got objectively worse
Can't even see my followed categories anymore
Which for a fighting game viewer wanting to watch events is pretty irritating
if so would that folder be sponsored by QUAKEer oats?
anything that causes the numb condion? would linken park quallify?
something neat about the prog virus, they can delete themself
??? wonder what the bots refrencing?
I just learned I can play rayman origins in ultra wide phanto274ColonD
Im one of the crazy ones that loved origins and and thought legends was great but not nearly as good
and then for controls I used JoyToKey to map keyboard to pokken controller
lets be glad capcom isnt into the content creation biz like sega... i could imagine their take on poggers would be proggers ... as in the mr program.
i rember woody being quite the tank...
found another AP rando for you to try LUL
Yu-Gi-Oh! Ultimate Masters: World Championship Tournament 2006 KEKW
yugioh rando? that sounds like pain.
there also a apworld for yugioh forbidden memories but that is hell
Splash says hi bc hes too lazy to come in the stream
... is it possable to have an extreme need for sadomasichism to do it?
Gonna have you on in the back, I'm busy advocating for justice over at Freeze's stream
It didn't but I was hoping it would
I think Twitch update SUCKS!!!! stickshamSUCKS
You showed the old man a meme off tik tok
Aayyyy I barely made it. GG!!
nnever know might get there one day
thanjks for the stream then sleep well
@splashv_ did you find a job on Twitter?
Is there an option for no sails?
was NOT expecting the late night Raven stream, but I ain't complaining
also, I was sitting out in my grandma's garden, and heard my phone from outside
apparently we had too much fun w/ the longshot and MM hookshot
@Ohrocks can you believe that direct w/ no games? smdh
they want me to come to their lame ass museum and learn shit
Who's going to play giant Smash 3DS with me?
lol, I was wondering why you were posting about the Mega Nintendo DS
Giant Smash on the Mega Nintendo 3DS
My timeline's trying to sway me into acting unwise over a rat
if / when you get a sec, check ur Twitter dms
20 bucks is something to me tf?
$20 is the $5, it ain't shit in the long run
If it builds up into combo breaker money, it's important
my $'s currently building for Mixfest
I joined Costco at the start of May, so my vacation time's guaranteed to refresh right before CB
I've NEVER seen this grotto before
I'm currently reading this Marvel about this dude harassing Dr. fuckin' DOOM over $200
tbf, I'd have done the same thing over $200
I've a friend who's so Goddamn contrarian, he thinks the Wii U is better than the Switch
same mf'er who thinks Sonic Omens is a good game
"I like the Wii U better because I modded the shit outta it" - him, paraphrased
Okay but you can't look down at the gamepad with the switch
that's fine, but that's like saying my PC is the best console cuz I can run a buncha emulators on in
I am tired as hell after eating like it was combo breaker weekend today
I think the iQue is the best console
if you're comparing consoles, it should be vanilla hardware, not mods
had mcdonalds portillo's and dairy queen
And you didn't share @seventyfourtg ?
why is there a catgirl when I type mods
@Ohrocks It was a family occasion
The only mod emote that should exist is modCheck
then, why tf does it appear for ME? ? ?
was it cuz I was in morph stream before I jumped over here?
I like how the light arrow is just a shotgun
these are the best light arrows
mostly cuz those damn things are non-existent after WW
worst part about MM is you get nothing but arrows from every dungeon
WW's the last time you get element arrows (I think?)
morph, why does mods show a catgirl in your stream
The "not feel so good" arrows
imagine how bad ganon is if he doesn't get erased by light arrows
AIN'T NO DAMN WAY YOU GONNA GET BUTTS IN THE SEAT WITH THAT GARBAGE
what's the point of fast food when this shit's so expensive
Just pray they open a Jersey Mike's
at least Chipotle offers food that pretends to be healthy
one of the things I miss about the old job is this Vienna's that did a 2 hotdog + fries + drink for like $7
that combo hard-carried me when I was rushing out the door without eating breakfast
Minigames?  If it's a Luigi minigame I'm all for it, if not... runera3Leave
I think this sNeed SUCKS!!! stickshamSUCKS
work at 11am, so I'm heading to bed
don't work for a living. This shit sucks
Pokémon Unite made an update to reports... for Voice Chatting
They're going to monitor what is said and deemed ban worthy or permanent account suspension.  They'll also look into who is abusing the report system... and timeout accounts for "false" reports
I sent Jesse the notes and his response is "aw fuck"
Maggie is going to have them
Now you you need the gem in the sword to have piss in it
All RavenFP had to say was, "I think this seed is SUS!" stickshamSUCKS
stickshamSUCKS I think this Hyrule SUCKS!!!
You'll never get those seconds back
Should've just hit all your shots smh
The Link behind the slaughter of Ganon
yoo, I missed the end of last night's stream so congrats on the sub 1:53
hey phantom, gl on the runs
Hey Phantom! Hope you are doing well
do the japanese say error or ellol?
when I talk to blackjack he says "osu"
i thought stalkor was trying to say hello lol
you just grinded for early levels. its fiiiiine
was reviewing the rules for TPR S1, it sure is restrictive
Ive never even heard of a stream delay
the satelite virus battle chip that has the cursor
its so good for iceman, Dalus got it once lol
yeah waterworks comps really outstay their welcome
single virus encounters are the strangest thing bn1 has
the escapes running from the first 5 slots LUL
chad doesn't deserve to have his emails read LUL
you want to go 5 steps without encounters? you should try bn2 then KEKW
bn2 SS is superior in every way
dash manip is getting the 5 dash chips from dog house?
half the folder and no escape itskir5Sadcrying
if there was an average expected time loss for not getting escapes it what be interesting
the worst bn1 draw RNG I have ever seen itskir5Angypup
well if we tracked how many encounters are in a run on average and how often you get escape youd find out how far you are over or under escaping
dynawave is my fav chip. I can't believe the mettaur 3's wouldn't drop any
but does the WR get good escape draws the whole way through? maybe 1 split is always gonna get owned
I think it ends up being close-ish to 50/50
if its 50/50 and the wr got every escape he wanted gonna be basically unbreakable till a new manip
Any% makes all the RNG chips turn into the only encounters
yes remobit is an RNG chip
yeah i thought maybe 120 sword would be good but meh luck
but each time you gold a split makes it harder to gold it next time. shows progress
or need the money for later
there's where all your escapes went
bottom decking your escapes working LUL
and their chip only does 100
thank goodness getting to the den town school blackboard power up is consistent
If there was a crayon encounter there I would be scared
yeah i mean gambling is fun xd
JP runners movement looking scary close to TAS
1 escape? ez draw. 5 escapes? Hardest chip draw of all time
does saving and restarting reset your step counter?
right i was just thinking it might be faster  xd. didnt know the rules
I've been making a few dungeons with quest master since I learned about it from you, really fun game
I'm designing mine with the overworld maket in mind lmao
yo gl on the runs today Phantom! phanto274GL
There we go c’mon chip trader
finally, a stream that contains no salt
so September’s game is… BN4 phanto274ColonD
gl on cards or chips or whatever theyre called
i have a good feeling about this run
everytime i watch you run this i get so close to replaying falzar
the lair doesnt have megaman anymore NOOOO
i had to do some stuff im back
okay trying and doing are two different things
is this the game with like 15 billion passwords?
NumberMan is so feared in today's society
ok i followed a series of clues and dug up a hidden chest containing cybeast gregar and am now playing
Also, gathering clips for the promo video
Beat fireman in 1 hour am I on pace
boss can't win if you escape HahaThink
hope the run's been good to ya
Missed the stream but gratz on the PB!
brb going to Japan to go ham on the Nintendo gachapon machines for Gamecube controller replacement parts
yea could even just be my end browser or my brain
its not as if you suddenly look like 160p v 1080p
currently tryin to decide if it was a good idea for me to have started the monkey ball 2 set
but the speed challenges are speedrun-angle-based PrideLaugh
soooo thats a steep "yup off the rails we go!"
but its then definitely also among the tech which I need to fiddle with
I'm not working tonight but I'm also not done sleeping 😴
its not on every level which is good
I am currently just mild happy that I got the SM64DS set done now PrideLaugh
started it yesterday in a friendly achievement gathering race (8hrs were set, most cheevos get wins) between me and a cozy person and after that I obviously then wanted to finish that set PrideLaugh
surprised how much I wasnt mad at the controls of that game as a kid
cus BOY are dpad controls for former joystick movement rough
the biggest jump for me rly just was that when you recently played either 64 or other 3d Mario entries then go to it
you can feel the wish to have a joystick over the dpad
and having fixed angle movement in 3d with environments wanting you to have 360degrees is very feelable - especially when you dont have good touchscreen access
Where is your plushie of that enemy, phantom 🤨
also for the retrocheevo set (which I know you dont necessarily look much into completions there) - having the minigames there as much as its relatively easy to get most of them done, have a couple rough entries if you are lacking that touchscreen
and having had to back that up with pause buffering to make due was most certainly something PrideLaugh
hey phantom, gl on the runs
I have a protoman plush gminus1UwU
You didn't have to one up me gminus1RIP
this all has to be setup based KappaPride
joking in case not obvious but also wouldnt doubt it given how early in the run it is
it'll die and people will be cursed to forever drink the grape juice
I love how the school comp theme is a remix of the title music
bn1's OST in general is quite underrated
i should make a new dungeon
but i ain't got no ideas lmao
nice a metguard G. Now all you need is a dash G phanto274Smile
sounds like they are scary golds
it's impossible for him to NOT be a moron
dex the name in terms of writing it out?
either way: he was dash dancing, playing melee with himself
I have been around teamBN for 3 years
aka outside of manips, there's some insane timesaves which could be possible under the best circumstances outside of movement and other execution related timesaves
I used to think dalus was the best bn runner until jugoomba took over
yeah once they changed it to lifesword it was like "finally some good fucking food"
but in this game it's like "oh. ew."
and then they just massively overcorrected in 2 lol
most bn1 PA's are really strange since instead of being a more powerful version of the chip family like with heavystamp from bn2 its just cycling between the three
gater, lifesword 3 and bodyguard are insane
bn2 does have lifesword 2 and 3
the blade chips come in * code and with gospel duping you can just spam the PA without messing with folder flow
bn2's pas are so notorious that prof made the no g patch lol
bn3 was last bn game that had some good PA's. They fell off hard in bn4-6
Is this the one with the K Y Jelly chips? XD
I don't remember which one had it, since they change up the letters each game, I just remember that one of them has Jelly chips that only have the letters K and Y
Might have been 3, that's the one I played most as a kid
@azuraiak yep its bn3. Metagel1 K an Y are custom style exclusive chips
K is blue exclusive and Y is white exclusive
So, do you prefer random encounter systems in games, or ones where you can see (and avoid) encounters on the overworld?
Since you play both kinds of games
Makes me wonder why so many RPGs insist on random battles
@azuraiak it was easier to program
if you can adjust encounter-rates in the wild (not necessarily the rarity though preferably also) I dont mind RNG encounters
Especially in games where specific enemies have specific drops, etc
i know someone who absolutely HATES random encounters and thinks any game with it is just terrible and it's like... chill out lol
they definitely have their place in the sense that they make rendering an overworld simpler
not that efficiency with rendering an overworld has been a high priority nowadays because "why not crank the hardware out to the max"
Unrelated question, of the MMBN series, which one would you say is your actual favorite to play?
I disagree. 6 is the best casual bn game
like - sure, there are games which dont need to saturate the hardware to the max. and devs which still care about efficient coding
@past88345 I just realized something, I think 6 is the only one I never finished at least the plot. Never managed to 100% any post games, though. Having to trade chips got in the way lol
i can agree with that easily
i'd rank 6 above 3 honestly just by virtue of having way more navicust freedom throughout the game
100% bn3 requires trading but others don't thankfully
i love 3 don't get me wrong but always needing press or needing to swap in energychange for various parts and just not really getting that full control over your navicust layout
I mean, 4 was written by a grade schooler, wasn't it?
Like, literally, kid won a contest
4 was written? I thought they just threw darts at a wall and made a plot with where they landed.
Nice WideSword to get out of that situation.
yeah i cannot find anything about a kid writing the storyline for bn4
you read the email already LUL
just to spread more hate on the game
Anyone ever watch the anime based on this series?
it has its issues sure but lets not make stuff up about it lmao
I was going to watch it all but I became too based
these are my first posts in THIS STREAM
@mirby_studios It's possible that was just a schoolyard rumor about the game
Credit where credit is due. BN4 has the best ending.
they're not gonna let a kid write a story for a full video game
design a navi? sure. write the entire main storyline? no
bn4's ending makes you go: "Is that it?!"
You can't beat Regal jumping off a building in slow-mo straight into credits.
I mean the storyline is "tournament, then suddenly the big bad that had nothing to do with the rest of the story"
especially not with how well received bn3 was, they're not gonna go "you know what lets just not let anyone professional write this story lets just have some random kid write it"
adults can write bad stories too
Yeah. I'd just wager it up to "Oh man, we need to make another game and quickly" more than a kid wrote it.
Now if you told me that a kid designed a navi, I can believe that since they did have competitions to get your own navi in the game. But those were delegated to Mr. Famous and BowlMan/MistMan, right?
nope, they had those designs for the rest of the series
gridman was also a kid design iirc
basically mr famous's navis outside of gateman were fan designs afaik
Yeah. That's what I was saying.
ah i missed that part about famous lol
You good. 👍 It's really cool that they even did that, imo.
Imagine the bragging rights you get as a kid.
i mean it's just bringing back the NES MM contests which was cool too
Come to think of it, the person who told me that 4 was written by a contest winner also told me incorrect things about 3
I think he might not be a reliable source of info XD
He thought a good chunk of the postgame was Japan only for 3
... Which sadly WAS true for 6
If your house is on fire, don't ask them what to do. LUL
anyways friendly reminder that one of the artists for both the eyeshield 21 manga and one-punch man's online version also designed both Dust Man and Crystal Man in MM4 and MM5 lol
that would be strange if a contest winner got to write the plot
@honornite he's a chef now, so he'd probably start cooking
first to ask that this hour, yes
The first since the last guy
oh nice, comparing with jugoomba KEKW
I wish the tower chips returned
i never liked them honestly, just because if i accidentally moved i could just miss with them entirely
I bought actual retro games today... as in not wii and and not gamecube LUL
Oh no, Link! Your hearts are beeping
link tot he past and pokemon gold
fire tower at least left lingering fire which the enemy could walk into
you dont jack in for the HP memory?
Dang. That's a sick battle background. I'd like that in BN6.
I made the drive for lttp, and they still had gold so why not? Ive never actually played gen 2 before
is crystal that much better than gold?
... I'm wondering what a randomiser for this game would be like. A big ol' mess most likely
@axl_sr you can be a girl in Crystal so it's 10x better imo lol
honestly i dont care about that
its just a gameboy sprite after all
The main advantage of Crystal is a guaranteed encounter with Suicune
platinum felt like what gen 4 should have been by base
I heard there is a save glitch for getting all the starters, and with sparce encounters I may just go that route
Yes, but Platinum being so obviously superior to D/P is probably why they stopped making Special Third Versions after that
black 2 white 2 really benefited from being sequels
Because they worried people would just not buy the original releases
ultra sun and moon feel like a waste of development time
despite the 3rd version never selling as well?
USUM coming out a year after SM sure felt like a slap in the face
oh right, that did release lol
Sucks that XZ and YZ never came to be or pokemon Z
The anime along with sun and moon had to fill in the blanks
thank god everything will go well this run
sucks that triarrow doesn't combo numberman because he still flinches to weak chips
i have come to formally apologize for my internet killing your streak in my stream phantom :(
bn1's bosses are so weird because they either flinch to chips that are 30 damage or greater or never flinch at all
stoneman flinches to chips that 100 or more so he never does in an any% run
the most escape reliant part of the run
"I wish we had a little more money"
sadly can only listen and not watch
there is more skill in a MMBN game than a card game TBH
Because it's not only work with what you got, its reaction speed and timing
then gl with the goal to beat the pb
ugh you switch back to lan right when the song gets good lmao
What's worst, BN1 or BN2 runs?
what little I played BN2, that shit somehow felt rougher than BN1
BN2 has so many QoL updates over 1 it's smoother overall lmao
either way at least you can run at will lol
I could never handle speedrunning a game this rng heavy tbh
we will never stop the bots for good so phanto274Ban
last time i played lttp I needed a guide to finish it lol
i have 4 streams open and it was only you
bot what are you on lmao
where has the time gone? Its been 20 years since the first naruto movie phanto274S
So I just tried to fire up gold and it didnt want to start
I opened it and the back of the board was black
btw they literally opened it to swap the battery but didnt clean the back
so I cleaned it myself and now it works
I didnt think to take a pick before
they got it to work cause they tested the save cause of the new battery
thoughts on doing a starter only run? Cause you can save and reset to get all 3
like is it enough to get you thru the game cause HMs and stuff
cyndaquil i imagine could learn it
so totodile line cannot use waterfall. How required is it?
did you know that around the time the BN6 released you could go on capcom's BN website and you could play 3 BGM's from BN6? one was cyber city, another was exploring the net, and I think the last one was virus encounter.
I def browsed thatt stuff as a kid. I even went on the japanese site and thats how I learned chaos unison was in 5. I popped off seeing a screen of proto chaos LUL
ProtoChaos pause buffer + SuperArmor is how I S ranked ProtoMan to make his SP chip better
ngl, I like the first game having unique panels for each dungeon
hows it going. we got a run going, ill let you focus
oh? stream during my shift?! I will be there
maybe blacktigerr will be asleep so I can be first for once KEKW
@Axl_SR i don't sleep until 2 KEKW up by noon
hear that phantom? you need to start earlier phanto274Ohoho
also axl I'm close to 69 1st
just pretend you have movement bug
couldnt let you have a 5 min pb xd
Insane run bro LETS FUCKING GO
but they ran the game forever
is isaac rolling your pax seed?
ball is in fatkids court LUL
Tournament Qualifier Race, no help, no specific questions like "where was x?", etc.
How many in racetime so far?
Thought it'd be something like 40
well this is during 1st shift so likely a bit of people are working
Gm I'm still slamming my pc
I only know Ike and beest in this
which good players are in the race room, i only know you and swiftike are playing (nobody else i know plays tp)
Idk we have top players here
I would watching gymnast too but I need my other monitor
race isnt for 30m still right?
Heyo, GL in the race today
I got so fucking mad at oot that I just unfollowed years ago
I dont care about zelda that much LUL
I used to restream for them lol. But I kinda don't enjoy racing randos anymore, I just wanna play for fun
@bleedingblue11 we also raced years ago when we had our group, now like, no one's around anymore lol
Yeah I think we all kinda got over racing OOT
Community kinda was. I remember asking in the discord where iron boots were when I did gold scale water in a weekly and got flamed for missing them
maybe i should play it then lol
@bleedingblue11 they shamed me for ff for a 50 strength logic
oot rando is unironically too small to be enjoyable
It can be enjoyable audio, the community is dogshit
when in douubt just assume every song is from smash lol
Even in scrubs people were toxic as shit towards me
Scrubs wasn't as bad but it still wasn't great
Just talk like a regular person
includes "you forgot to mark [item]"
I will still be degen on main
This is gonna start at like 12:20 my time
Every weekly I ever joined there were always a few that weren't ready until like 5 mins after start time
I think OOT standard was force at 5 min after
Gotta teach people to be on time somehow
if you can't be on time, lose idc
If you keep waiting on them they'll keep being late
I feel like I should know this song but cant put my finger on it
This is milk bar from mm
Oh don't remember what the last one was
He did a truckload of rando before release
He is pichu, just not until racetime basically
damn you started super early i just got back to my room
No one wants to be the first
This is sonic adventure 1 right?
Lmao oops, it sounds like the snowboarding song
I have a song I want to make you add
Ike's too busy fighting for his friends
mostly done with stuff on my end so can focus on the race
did you get to do anything with gymnast outside of the run at GDQ?
Nah too many FEH players and Engage and Smash players are all making Ike work
63rd TP rando, almost at seed 69 KEKW
we need a celebration for race 69
im writing down hints myself LUL
Was dancing with niece in law until we got interrupted by a emergency weather thing
Haro haro good luck good luck, are we loosing already? Kappa
Took us right back to the TV version on paw patrol
I did the shadows... on shadow (lol), doing patrick star rn
oh no link has no hearts D: is dead?!
No help or specific questions... got it
Okay I still can't immediately get wolf link to surface... he just swims upwards
Tournament? Was gonna ask why yer live so early LOL good luck
didnt know you could side jump there to avoid fall damage
Where's the decency of the seed evo17Flip
2 rods don't make a right @axl_sr
If only I had luck as great as you when it comes to Bo
well, that's one way of hopping up a ledge
He uses side step so much
dont we call that one goat Jeffery?
"aight homie, I tried being reasonable" (notches bomb arrow)
I missed it... what'd ya get?
You didn't have to call yourself a jackass :/
Dunno much about this game, is sword required in every seed or can you get through without one
Honestly it's ZSR tradition to roll the worst bullshit for qual 1 of a tournament
Having Ball is at least 'ok'
I leave for a bit and it's still being garbage
Like what he has to do is ass
Like to make you have to go through these dungeons again due to sword placement is dumb
I know how you feel man...it's fucking stupid
Had this seed I told axl about where I got tired and looked at the spoiler log...progression went to a goddamn circle
That shouldn't have been a thing
good i was wondering if anyone else had finished
Sadge i been afk for the pass 30 mins trying to fix my ps5 pretty sure its dead
oh no blacktiger! is the warranty still good?
nope i bought it off someone like 3 years ago
the ps5 has already been out for that long??? jfc i feel old
So like the 1st bomb bag was behind rod? Ol
Yeah I remember that chest. Alot of folks just cheese it like you say
Yeah.. the placement of that sword is sad
I wonder where that last sword is at 🤔
I was peeking at Gym earlier
No he had steel sword by Grounds
Zelda sucks at aiming, stay tune
So I don't know what happened with Gym
alot of the finishing times are pretty close
For what I see the rando leeches won this race
the fact all the swords were sword locked was insane lol
I got soft locked on dead sword
if you want my dungeons I can send you the codes. First one is parkour, second is traditional but long.
so I left, found spinner, and instantly had to go back lmao
I’ve been listening to this while playing Escape Sim
I can send my dungeon too, its just traditional zelda dungeon
my second dungeon is only like 20% complete
i know darkness has some really big ones lmao
Yeah I just finished the really big one lol
i remembered you said you were gonna play our stuff, so I spoilered it for that
I was working on that basically the entire time you were playing rando lol. Finished like 30 min ago.
ID for the long one is: 4281326
that is the intended way. The heart piece ones are difficult
Yeah maybe I shoulda put a way to get back from that lol
or made that one easier lol
okay this mighta been harder than I anticipated lol
I thought checkpoints would heal yeah so there's a very limited number of healing spots...
could be worse, like how my levels check points just didn't work so people would die and have to restart
go up if you want to die
you get a full heart out of it tho :P
yeah the elevated ones do that
phantom playing something made this year holy shit
i havent seen much but it looks really cool for people who like the classic zeldas right
never been a big fan of them but i kinda wanna try this
phantombot will randomly generate the command and the giveaway opens
like monkeys and typewriters or whatever
height based combat in a top down game wait a minute
"can i beat quest master without sail cloth?!"
oh hey that works too lmao
I don't think that was the intended way lmao
notice how sometimes the arrows spawn shooting backwards.
oh you're really gonna hate my dungeon if you don't like those thigns...
prolly will be fixed by tomorrow or something yeah lmao
allot of these puzzles use to require you to do the roll into the tornado but I made it possible without cuz people didn't seem to figure it out easily
i have no way of hinting you to do that either
yeah I was about to say
this is totally different from when I tried it out
the sword coins are kinda like gold skutullas for me
my dungeon has an actual shop cause gotta give people a reason to collect all dem coinz
you get a reward if you collect all of them
just no one ever finds the first one
but I didn't know how to get to it
I made it more obvious when I updated it
top-down game w/ rolling? I'm sold
you can kinda just charge spin attack and walk under him when he hops
I have yet to try this game myself yet
But I also dont wanna fight this boss and he seems to be in every dungeon LOL
okay that's a definite bug lol
you might have to his retry
so youd have to re do all of it
think that's it. Cause yeah you can't finish now
you need the rod to kill the final phase
you can still do this part at least
yeah the key for the final hit is to have him jump at you then roll under him
you can go under him when he hops
if you charge spin you can just walk under him too
thats why the pot is there and also the reset switch
back again ps5 still dead Sadge i try everything at this part need a new 1 i guess
Well no wonder all I've watched had wooden at most
Meh first race seeds are always a clown show regardless
it took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to figure out that you could just go up to the upper level to get into the tornado trap. I tried for like 5 minutes to jump from the lower tornado to the upp er one
Dungeons I got for my first seed, AG, lakebed and cits
I hate that they can't be killed
oh yeah I put it there on purpose
I figured like bombs or something could do it but nah
cuz the puzzle is easier from that side
what if I locked the door
and made you do the loop LUL
I feel like i should have made 1 more floor with sail cloth stuff
but I can remake this dungeon from the ground up when overworld editor comes out
wait that floating one has no balloon!?
it glitched when I put the balloon on it
you should do a tier list of the BN6 patch cards Kappa
geetting that BN content out there
If Kabu from kirby was a boss fight
I wonder if they'll make mini versions of this boss as the armos
yeah Julian (the lead dev) talked about making one
well on the bright side youre gonna be real good at this boss
if you aren't moving when he flies up he will immediately slam
so you can kinda speed it up
slime was like you can't fire me I quit!
I thought they updated the ai to not do that lmao
sail cloth makes the hits easier as well
should I spoiler it or nah
also this ones gonna take 2 hours
yeah there's a cracked wall in the first room. I never figured out how to blow it up tho.
well killing enemies will make it perform better !
but the engine does not like big maps
as fluid as stunt race fx rn
also look at the top right :P
I think its so big with many loaded things
I feel like they could load a 30x30 around the player or something and just have stuff in memory but not rendered
you should check out the first offshoot btw once you're done here.
oh yeah that a bit jank maybe I should telegraph that better. But when you enter make sure you go to the left and touch the area where there is no wind
for some reason if you change floors it won't respawn you
if you don't touch a valid floor
so make sure you touch the offshoot where there is no wind
but yeah this was my attempt at a sidescroller lol
put the tornado back you can't have nice things
too many enemies and it causes lag for everyone
you'd see the chest, but not the door actually
I was gonna make an extra hidden dungeon with a shop but there isn't really anything good to sell and I ran out of dungeon ideas
yeah the sidescroller is very jank
it's easier to start from the other side
yeah I didn't realize those were one way lmao
it relies on a technique that's not well telegraphed but I tried to teach it above
5 waves mighta been a bit much
so you don't hit multiple yeah
yeah there are 2 solutions actually, and that is one of em
I ran out of ideas lol
originally that one was gonna be simon but I couldn't make it work the way I wanted.
oh right you have sailcloth you can cheat XD
yeah the other one is really hard
yeah that's the only heart fragment in any dirt/rock/bush
this one is absurdly difficult lmao
yeah you need to do the sidescrollers to get the final heart
but at least they're still full heals
the lever was just to make the teleporter disappear
it is but only when you first charge it
this map is so big and confusing lmao
yeah especially since everything is one way
yeah I made sure to give a ton in my traditional dungeon A cause I had nothing else to give really and B cause it's so big
yeah the green blades travel along walls
This game looks so Zelda - A Link to the past -like
The skeletons are moving 100% like a ALTTP ones
well you can use the extra key for the map
Orrr you could be a gamer and save the key
yeah that's the room you need ot get to I think
That room didn't open up until after you hit the switches on the way to moldorm, I think
Weird that you can't grab the heart with it
I guess that's what the extra keys were for
So this seems kind of miserable
this is gonna be 4 waves lmao
I think this level lives up to your name
see if you can light them up
This is gonna take a while lmao
wow that was still shorter than my dungeon lmao
Well I guess they can give it to a friend
if you enter the boss area with no keys you're just fucked lol
damn you were only 1 min off WR
I have a dungeon for you yo try...
Do you have dungeons lined up?
I have a code for kaizo platforming that I didn't make :P
Apparently Fire Rod is the objectively correct choice
try to keep the Lunarc's away from the walls
Oh they literally one shot you ?
wtf is this i just got back
so pretty sure my ps5 motherboard is fried
My map is getting to this point propokM
I'll throw in a level if you want
Assuming you haven't played it, I'll put in this level: 4240712
This level seems alright so far
Oh, I gotta find a use for that hahah
you can see em on the map they show up as Xs on walls
Maybe check your map if you can't see cracked walls
tbh the cracked wall is way harder to see on this theme than the grass one lmao
maybe that's just cause I've never played/built a map with this theme tho
Agreed, though I thought this theme was more thematically appropriate for bomb stuff
Sideways cart to make it one-way :)
You'd be surprised how long people take to realize they can blow that wall from the other side of the fence
Fun fact, bats can't hurt you when in a mine cart, it's just fun scare tactic
Mechanic if you're not aware, you can roll into crates and barrels to break them
that animation also plays if you roll into a tree in the overworld
Compass pointed to the key in the pot, not the heart piece
Classic Zelda, giving you a bomb flower
There's 8 heart pieces in the level, it's ok if you miss one
if you ever get a boomerang you can get that I think
wow ur playing mina the hollower early
took a walk and spotted a place that offers 1/3 double cheeseburgers for $3.99
will investigate further (ie, when I'm hungry)
That *might* work but honestly not sure
that's definitely not the intended way lol
I tried to add safety rails
Hm.... that's interesting, honestly didn't know you could push the cart back onto the rail
for when the game adds durability ig lmao
The lever made the left conveyor belt move
that seemed a bit much lol
Green slimes make the bombs bounce away instead of just exploding, unfortunately
how uh... how was qualifiers today haha\
there aren't many fire enemies unfortunately
wow as soon as you start talkling i get an ad, thanks twitch much apreciated
Maybe one day I'll replace it, but for now it works and makes it unique compared to the 20,000 Moldorms out there
just fire slimes, fire bats, and shellshots that can shoot fireballs
i think the shots were what really pushed it over the edge
how was the seed today? it seemed riugh
yeah i only saw snippets on TSR, bcuz i was working
yeah even when doing sphere 0 checks, faron field is last
comments are up on racetime btw
i read the racetime comments but i didnt realize it was THIS bad yeesh
how did he do arbiters without spinner?
i was looking at the ranking afterwards just SWEATING hahaha
it's funny there was a massive gap after your time lol
yeah and out of 29, like 6 DNF, and then 19 beat my PB lmao so im just SWEATING in regards to my abilit to race
oh you out of logiced not needing dom rod? beautiful
other people did not tho apparently
bewildebeest said they did all dom rod checks
im guessing it was the owl statue chest on eldin bridge? sorry i was listening but my brain blanked out on the locaiton you said
i saw gyms comment abt eldin bridge
yeah being able to skip ddr is excellent
yeah I mean you were within 10 min of 5th
I wanna see what happened with pigeons run, he wasn't restreamed and i was surprised on his time
quite a few are saying they got lantern late
from what snippet i hear, i do think i heard them speak about the sword, because i heard them talking about "they need to go to faron field now"
like one said their go mode was lantern into spinner
but yeha sounds like an unlucky seed, makes me sweat about how im gonna do saturday LMAO
i'll be running saturday, and commentating sunday
when do you leave for pax again?
yeah thats why im commentating LMAO
the yapping is the best part tho LMAO
oh Pocky, I took a nap. Werre you able to solve troubleshooting?
yeah my PC decided to just die on me yesterday? I had to reinstall windows bcuz the windows 10 update just broke my entire windows
fun fact: there are a bunch of different ways to do the lower part of this puzzle
im very far away from my monitor LMAO
i found like 3 or 4 ways and when i had maddy playtest they found yet another way lol
draw your path before starting over
anyways, good luck with your stream, ima head to bed lmao work be killing me
some of these comments are funny
"didnt know that stealing bomb bag could take your bow away" and "too dumb to load the correct seed"
yeah idk why you don't use KB. KB makes the game much easier imo cause afaik you're locked into 8 directions even with analog stick.
uh there's a lever in the upper left...
yeah couldn't really make that one more intuitive
the way keys follow you reminds me of yoshis island
you can't put anything in them (yet)
nah you can't put stuff in the grass
also cause it was the only way to actually get you to reset to start of room without jank or unintended cheese
i tried conveyers and you could hella cheese the room lol
i am not ashamed of my references
made an arrow with them to point at the door
i am not the best player at zelda or zelda-likes. if it's not simple it's probably not the idea
oh there IS a softlock in this room but you have to intentionally do it
i kept it there as punishment lol
i did not expect this room to be a sticking point lol
the softlock is throwing the key over the conveyers
which... why would you throw it backwards
to a place you can't reach again
there were other softlocks but that's why i had maddy test the stage, so they would find ones i missed lol
i had a few softlocks in that minecart room and i had one in the 2 3 1 switch room cause i forgot to put a reset there lol
yeah I already have 93 hours in the game and I got it from you last Wednesday lmao.
if you make stages in this game, please find someone to playtest them. smartest thing you can do
so I don't have to lag the game with my overworld
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
have a good one phantom :3
@Mirby_Studios I submit my levels dry no playtester lmao :P they've gone surprisingly not terribly
yeah I'll try to make a bigger level for next time :P
I'm sorry phantom but if you lose this we're no longer friends
my new ps5 get here In 4 hours POGGIES
Prayge my rebirth save is saved in cloud
Phantom iom so nervous lmao save me
hey hey! phanto274Wave i just moved back to college
you need to put it on an item slot of a bomb bag, otherwise you won't have bombs
do you need to give yourself bomb bag?
you can see, next to the slot on the bottem of the screen what is default
I think it is 12 to 14
it is stupid getting bombs on gz :(
ok press x to delete it
nah it didn't hit and I don't know what causes it to sometimes not hit
I think you are not allowed to claw at the same time the bomb explodes
ah yes, the sword not in the inventory but still having a sword
yea I didn't know it either, I warped there from a biginning of a vanilla safe without a sword so I could try it out
use dom rod to pull the sword free Kappa
seems to only interact with sword
Yoo Phantom, good luck today phanto274BLANKIES str9ngLove
I still can't understand lja...it's really hard
Hey Phantom! GL with the randos
I just signed up for pmr league season three!
perfect rng + new peach strat lmao
Just saw Jaiden's new video. She won a million from mr beast to give to her subs and is using it to pay for people going to art school.
did you see the no sword morpheel thing
the bomb can just not hit the eye sometimes
well that makes it easier I guess
isaac also said its race legal
so I guess if we need lakebed swordless there you go
I figured it would be, but I wanted to know from isaac
cuz I dont feel like getting dqed
Maybe the bomb thing for snowpeak?
only reason id learn that is cuz it feels slower to do it vanilla
What is this btw? I could practice the blizzeta thing
I just watched someone do it and started doing it 80% consistently tbh
I have trouble doing some stuff
Well I would try and it wouldn't work
we mean the 1 cycle right
you kinda just stab the wall
and then roll into position fast
is that easier than item wheeel buffer?
iwabi setup is faster for sure '
tbh you can also just kill the mini boss if you want, it loses a bit of time though
especially if you dont have master sword LUL
Oh wait...I read that backwards lolz
Hey Phan...why do you have to delete save files to play a new seed?
hopefully today you wont fail the dom rod jump skip 20 times phanto274Smile
How do you get into the official race?
I mean like how good do you need to do in the qualifiers to move up?
finally found kibble my dog likes
I was giving her another kibble brand but she would only eat it once every 2 or 3 days
rip people with problems with 1 min remaining
do you know who is restreamed?
Thrown out like an application at a job with horrible managers
Yo i got TacoBell on the way
Ooooo did you get me a soft taco?
last seed I took notes as you were playing, not doing that this time tho lol
you know i hated my managers at el pollo loco but i still do love the food
i used to customize the $5 cheap burrito and add stuff to it lmao
is el pollo loco west coast only?
saved a bit of money that way
until they told me i had to stop doing that
it was founded in socal lmao
I'm doing a seasons rando for ap and idk how tf to get this check Madge
and the one i worked at was east bay
are they actually delaying for the one perrson?
whats the lore of that small cabinet behind you?
theres an el polo loco like 30 mins from me in central cali
okay, im not doing pape league either, its the 4ch LCL with coinsanity
I went to a local con and I am TIRED
about to get my hair cut
When you need a nap but you wanna watch race
they got congress everywhere these days
just put it over your game feed LUL
This is my first live zelda race with Phantom
But I'm also happy to be out of it
this is a qualifier match no help no asking where x was ect
I served, but now it's time to rest
Serving so hard takes a lot outta ya
I got a lotta Art merch
@blacktiger51 what if they miss goombario?
Ok Midna with that hair color is serving
I just took a shower, so I am COZY
Who knew ALTTP Blue Mail had such good initial item luck
its thee color blue and white whatever that means
they're blue, pink and white :P
That's why I said ALTTP Blue Mail Link
Because the only pink haired Link is ALTTP Link
oh I get it!! Link is matching your shirt!
rip. First time for everything right?
oh my god i just had a chatter that when i pointed out we didn't have the vehicle he wanted asked me to tell him what other companies might
Based on the items I have ideas as to where things are. Watching 3 streams while playing OW. Oh I've never had he so far
I see lots of blue for some reason lol
I'm super curious if I'm right and I think you'll be getting there before the other two so I'm mainly watching yours
that check was like "you've got mail"
Merhaps, but it's a qual race so I can't really say X location  because they'll think people are giving ideas
That and I've studied how logic works
nah go mode was getting Ball & Chain and Spinner as the first 2 items
I seem to always find both.
Oh yea I always look at ganon's castle sign. Tells you with race settings
that's 100x better than the inn reward!
you wouldnt by chance be able to unfuck a photoshop file?
What have you done with the PS file to fuck it?
I had classes on PS and never managed to break it. I am honestly impressed in the good way
been working on drawing on and off for past two months. I decide to stop for night. I hit save, watch it hit 100% and clear. Closed file, closed PS, put computer to sleep mode and go to bed
next morning, wake computer up, open photoshop, open file
all layers gone, and the image is just black and red
Getting one of the dom rods is almost never that hard. It's getting both that could have been fun
got the snipe clipped for ya
There was something here which is all I cared about.
Is it possible to LJA to hat spot btw
I've been tempted to try but I just always forget until I get back there
Oh no, especially with never trying it
Yea you can't get to tight yet though
OH hey so about that tight rope
I wonder if watching a 100% SR would show me a faster way to do this because jesus
I mean if you got time... pretty sure you gotta kill gohma with something somehow
For that magic armor you- oh yea :P
Snowpeak is just full of snow and nothing else
can ceiling deku be reached with ball and chain?
If you're high enough I think so.
This is no longer a race for ganon. It's now a race for all 7 hidden skills
I'm surprised the wooden sword could hold up to such powerful skills
I just noticed a cosmetic thing ive never noticed
so when you destroy the web with the ball and chain the color of the web will be what the lantern color will be. In this case it will be red
That makes sense. Never noticed that
oh my god just told a customer the team they want is open monday through friday and they asked "are they open today" did you see me say saturday
@Mirby_Studios welcome to customer service. Where they think they're smarter than you because of your job
What spider? Why were you claw shotting air?
i had someone yesterday ask a question, then i answered it using their own words to make sure it wasn't misunderstood... then they asked the same exact question again
Trust me. It's the exact same in the military. So dumb'
complain and you shall receive :P
wow what an unexpected place to find that wild
I had a seed where gale was the chest straight out of the temple
This is going to be small key 100%
Sir, you're not supposed to step on those.
sub 1 dungeon is really nice
btw, I found out diddy kong racing is in AP
it even has a pop tracker lol
I always forget how similar this boss looks to Gravemind KEKW
gonna chill here until bed. gamescom is killing me
so ive played the base DKR and it mostly just shuffles loading zones but I like what AP is doing. The balloons are color coded so like you need to find the 8 red balloons which belong to dino domain to actually finish that area. 5 colors in total for the 4 worlds plus hub world.
I have to mod our official stream, post on social media the whole time, yell at the photographer, appease the client and hope the CCs don't veto our content because "you got their bad side in that video"
"photographers and designers hate her guts"
I have learned a new place to skip an owl statue
I know that you can jump to the letter back in desert. Idk how to get to the chest though
you need aaaaall the things monkaSTEER
better than last rando with the sword
Oop. Buddy is back, OW time.  Time to hate our lives :D
our stream had several 2-3k people raids today and the only assholes spawned for the one slot where we had a drag queen CC on stage. The chat destroyed them quickly though, it was fun to watch
I'm too tired to think, someone gotta give me a hint
halp, I'm out of brain juice
Phantom doesn't have pink hair tho
i just looked it up, I know what the colors are now. Normally I dont pay again to that stuff lol
im failing to connect the dots KEKW
I'm thinking into the wrong direction it seems
No bgm makes this awkward lol
Still, add some like lullaby or some shit
I hate how loaded this spring is KEKW
i forget what jump strike looks like
Not useful, but it was something
rip... pronyo removing season zero from the presets
Bounces just like his man boobs
well, I love that this is required right now Cheer100
Can you even do under water goron? Because every time I've tried it doesn't let me without zora
that "goddam it" made me laugh
thank god for that one rupie you got in the inn so you can afford water bombs!
btw out of your new emotes ive been using phanto274S the most
maddy just got home and was like "what the hell one are they playing" and i said twilight princess and they went "i was gonna say this is too creepy"
and i said "yeah twilight princess"
MM is the creepiest tho with the masks :P
i love that you literally SQUASH IT with a GIANT FIST
Hey...luckily you didn't go through the temple instead xD
boss keya nd dip was the right choice lol
midna's like you already got a sword what do you need another one for?
oh right this game has snow area
i wonder where the other dom rod is
Full of nothing but snow and peak...and yetis
If I joined this race I would've been super fucked thinking sword was in the temple not on boss lolz
i peaked at another vod, i know where the dom rod is
i was about to ask how we doing here
hey at least you got a sword this time…
Did the sign hint to vanilla?
6 keys incluing cheese or no
whenever I play TP casually, I already get lost in this dungeon
also the ice box puzzles, hate them
Knowing what I know about this dungeon now, it would not be that hard in vanilla game
I just don't like this dungeon
Honestly this is my favorite boss because it's different than the others
Aren't all bosses different than the others?
for some weird reason I like the skeleton dragon even though I dislike the spinner item itself
I choked on my drink, thanks
wow not taking the chest. It could be double dom rod Kappa
great spin should count as 2 hits
I'm just terrible luck for your starting arrow shots ig
is that how you feel about bow? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEUGHGHGH
gannon says it's not over yet gotta keep the timer running :P
okay im back, can I say the things now?
D rod was at the top of ToT, and if you skipped boots you could get memo with magic armor, and lantern gives a bow in faron mist. But botts arre also required for fishing rod in stockcave
would you still be able to get fishing rod in stock cave without boots?
also gymnast was going into hyrule when you were going to ruins for reference
I'm wondering if, when you have MA you just wear it since you don't get slowed down. Could be interesting
i remember seeing it but where was it?
that wouldve been faster than doing iza for sure
finding first bow and sword in mist would be huge if it went thatt direction
yeah, normally you rush that hint at the fishing hole
people that did bo early got really rewarded
oh no Pocky is doing upper ToT
Even I wouldn't go goats at that point
and their sword is go mode
8 people in 5 minutes is wild
ngl I thought it was stalphoes
Here I was going to say gl but GG! phanto274GG
wait, I was distracted with our bad photographer. so did you qualify?
yeah, she just needs to fight the boss but has been exploring
I last locationed every item for progression
I didnt grab the armor cuz I went early too
If I had a hint saying boots is required and on iza and I dont have dungeons needing boots Id prob fish up MA early
it's almost midnight here and I still don't have the fucking video from my photographer because he fucked up for the third time now and has to redo shit
problem is if you dont get the hint, you aren't grabbing it
and if you get the hint after, whos running back there just to grab it
can you show stockcave without boots?
stockcave without boots is just parkour
I hope when they update the website they set up a cosmetics log
It's honestly pretty simple once you learn the angle
so you dont have to re do it every single time
Lava does 2 hearts no matter what
yeah i do that one too
doing ganondorf with mortal draw tho
OoT Lonk is proud that you learned all of his skills
shoulda picked up those rupies from Yeta
I just hope my placement is good enough to keep me in top 24
cuz Id hate to drop out
I did someone go to goron springs just to buy arrows
I forgot that shield existed tbh
ill keep it in mind for ruppeesanity
I got my sword from there
I ended up full clearing tot cuz I didnt wanna gamble it
you do the fight in tot and if you dont find it then you can go deeper
remote bombs and new boss are out for quest master
it will take me 50 hours to finish
I wanna see you do the 73 spherre seed that was genned LUL
ive done no keysanity before. I didnt enjoy it
watch next league be no keysanity
turns out I didn't miss a tattle after all. I had no idea that the magikoopa in the beginning doesn't count towards your tattle log and you have to get it later
so aside from me misunderstanding the Tutankoopa fight and accidentally saving after, I was able to one shot the set PrideUwu
yeah you finally completely your paper mario master quest jaye
there should be a seed where progress is locked behind this shop :P
thank goodness since I didn't want to play the whole game over just to tattle everything again
the restream has a close race
the only time collecting rupies will be important
cuz they just decided not to do poes
twitch we need a "jamming to malo mart" category please
make people wonder what the hell the context is in that one
okay, which 7tv mod is a sekapoko watcher, confess
time for me to make an LttP MSU and every song will be malo mart
i would but i need to make my SMZ3 expanded BN one first
the SM side will be network transmission music
i already have it planned out even
i just need to... actually make it
has the format been decided yet or is voting still up?
whats the best tracker/settings for paper mario noobs
the emotracker map one kinda confused me allot
cuz of how it layed out the maps
i couldn't tell where was what
I assume the hard part about combat is understanding what you need to win it
also it felt bad being and go mode and watching everyone finish ahead of me PepeHands
people started finishing as I beat blizzeta
yeah, I just happened to have it open
I've been itching to do a rando again soon
also, I just mastered Pac-Man on RA ohheyi30UWU
finally got arcade stuff to start working
and it was actually in hardcore mode?
everything wasn't too bad except for reaching level 17
Oh did you get one of those new controllers I've been seeing on twitter or is it just modded?
Where di you get the stick replacement out of curiosity? I need to replace mine soon I think
Oh no it's just another controller KEKW
but yeah, I don't do anything in softcore Mirby
I think Monado has a good handle on controller parts so I'll probably ask him
did it get a bunch of likes?
the new season is Added hidden panels, overworld and block coinsanity, partner upgrade shuffle to blitz settings. Should be the seeds 4-6 list.
Oh shoot maybe we bug Pronyo about that
Time to engage the groundhog day loop
well you could RNG into vanilla mario :P
today... we rando with no keys!
Just cut/paste your original intro :P
oh? last person finished TP with a 3:14
you might want to see a doctor
ok, gnight, tmrw is the last gamescom day... and then it's monday NotLikeThis
oh invis blocks are invis that's annoying.
my favorite classic cartoon, steamboat kooper
vanilla cake mix and calc lmao
is the leave and re-enter bug fixed in rando?
you kill a rando shy guy, leave and re-enter and the calc is on the ground.
I can smell the child is coming
These Shy guys and their hoard of stuff
hmm I wonder what this will be...
I got an ad for a Detroit axle what does that mean
you found all 4 keys in like the first 5 checks lmao
this is 7 stars, no keysanity
that's what you get for trying to cheese an intended puzzle!
I mean it's at least random on who gets upgraded
the first ever rando I did Power Bomb was vanilla cost but Mega Bomb was 1 FP :D
Or just find Super Rank Watt
dang did a tpr qual immediately into a wwr tournament match lol
I always forget how to get to here lol
the seed they're on is at 1:22
if you have bow you should be able to shop there imo
oh damn wait a minute this race is neck and neck
they literally in the same rooms
next day delivery with amazon prime
bro holy shit they literally killed ET boss at the same time
its a offical tournament match so I guess they picked a different match
looks like i didn't lose my rebirth save phanto274Pog
not doing 13 chapters of shit again
Not a good Ultra rank Bombette
is this fully rando FP/BP or semi-rando?
this chapter is one of the funniest low scaled
you gonna submit this as a PM64 speedrun :P
The hunt for a flying turtle to carry
Feels weird to see you play Pape now KEKW
So pretty much tp and pape?
I haven’t had a chance to try a seed of the proposed setting yet, what’s your opinion on them?
I thought the star beam settings would get more love but maybe the other ones paired with it weren’t great
does star beam even have any use outside of bowser?
Would be funny to manip peril with though
im making the worst seed in existence right now with plando
what a worth while and great room that was
also hows the seed going for you
would you play this terrible seed I've orchestrated Kappa
so you're saying theres a chance
Super Rank Watt is all you need
it's just the hammer and the chest above it right?
What kind of settings are these??
Ohhhh right the stones count as keys
are these settings so that all key items are in their chapter?
you know what would be funny would be dungeon shuffle where the keys are forced to be in the chapter that the dungeon is shuffled to. So like if the ruins entrance took you to chapter 7 all the ruins keys would be in the chapter 7 dungeon LUL
you should show the TP rando people this stream and tell them that no keysanity is a terrible idea and they should turn it on Kappa
but what's on the other side... prolly a 2nd blueberry and Boo Portrait :P
weak af Huff is always nice
I always forget does the tts thing work on resub
hey there's something in there you should buy
I would bribe you to get the goomba but I spent too much on that snivy lmao
2dcon is in a WAY better venue now
won't need to bribe if goombario is starting partner :P
It's laid out so much better now
also wtf game is that voice line from???
They still hate tournaments tho nothing has a prize anymore LOL
I think this will be a good rebuttal of why keysanity should always be on lmao
Only prizes were for 3rd strike and puzzle bobble cause the dude running them just made medals and shit
I did get a piece of paper saying I won for kof though lol
this kid took it, i think his name was Ash
that doesn't sound like shadow at all
damn i lost all my pictures i forgot about that Madge
I assume it's random from the game not random from the character lmao
I can't believe that ended up being an encounter
I think it's really cool you can still tell what's going on in the cutscenes without any dialogue at all
Why are you there Goombario, get back into that shop display that you belong in
when will there be a crowd control rando? so like pay x bits to take away a key or boots partner etc
Hopefully more random partner upgrade locations and not just shuffled vanilla
Oh god this room will suck now
Well not quite suck but way harder to skip the last two goombas
i did the parakarry way without looking at a vid KEKW
btw, right now you are ranked 8th with the first 2 qualifiers
just letting you know where its at rn
A little while ago someone was asking for a random pokemon type. I missed the pokemon part and said "high maintenance" OMEGALUL Cheer100
I am prob gonna enter tomorrows TP race
Nice. I made the start of a seed
Two flying turtles in this desert alongside some shoes
playing on gamecube must be uncommon cause I only see nintendont mentioned
interesting, the thing for me is to run wii I need a retrotink5X pro
it "works" but when I had to use my wii for GCMM the 2X only displayed it in black and white lol
do you have all the sometime hints memorized?
i have you on YouTube playing older ones right now. that's what I've been watching all day
Ive got a lot of catching up to do.
and that why you watch phantom5800 to teach you how to deal with hard fights
man there's 40 people on the standings list
i don't think I've ever seen that many people for tpr
some people already have 4 games
what sucks is i keep losing time to random stuff and or my execution just decides to be bad on a particular thing
tbf im doing quals as they come
I just dont wanna hit that spurt where all of them are out of my time frame
i constantly grind and practice between
tbf I dont think you could have done anything about sword just being sword locked
cuz your choice I think was statistically unlikely to be that
I just mean with the knowledge present
I think qual 2 went good for everyone
even though I last located bug I still didn't do bad lol
I feel like if you're doing ordon early
you might as well do goats and bo
the more I do it the more i feel that way
Well I wasn't saying you should always do them, just if you're gonna rush ordon off rip, the hint at that point doesn't do anything for you it feels like
also not gonna lie is really funny who they picked and then they picked ryuja with them
cuz all of them were similar skill level, and then there was ryuja
not calling them bad, but ryuja is kind of a lop sided match up for them, they're all equal in level I think roughly
atm you are the 8th place
So I guess we'll see how that progresses
one of these times I will remember to time that during a battle to try to throw you off
Can nax hurry to give ttyd rando
Or ootmm is of more importance
I guess that's what caused him to be knocked out lol
hey have u considered: hitting the button
If you're shuffling coins might as well make them all but keys shuffled
You're already shuffling a fuck ton of items KEKW
season 3 settings, 7 chapters, no keysanity Kappa
these settings will probably add about 10 minutes on average, for that sound about right? and potential for massive timesave if you get lucky
Maybe the median won't go up that much more
I like the idea of having to be more flexible on partners but I guess we’ll see how that actually plays out
Well you have less upgrades total with shuffle cause a bunch are shuffled into dead chapters right?
who the hell had that upgrade at the top
thought i saw someone else, mustve imagined it
I think that's the bigger issue yeah. If you had most of the upgrades not being able to choose would be less of an issue. Like if it was the keysanityless seed where they were just shuffled within themselves I think that would be much better.
I feel like there's gonna be a lot of that yeah...
but maybe this seed was just really tough
I'm just saving for hammy runs
doing my 1st pokemon rando and my starter was so ass and still using him cuz nothing better Madge
i just got waterfall so its a little better
Good ol' Paper Mario. I got a free demo in Nintendo Power back in the day!
my sp attack is lower then my attack so its still ass but its stab i guess
Sevii Islands, not to be confused with the Orange Islands
Out of curiosity, what time zone are you in, if it's ok to ask?
Ayo its the ass Pokémon game
Ass Pokemon? That's my favorite Type!
Yeah. Sure, i did, hopefully, no
i voted for the wrong thing and its didn't let me change my vote Madge
Poll? I'll have to check it out
Where is the poll? I don't see it
I tried to learn any% and fucking hated it
Kind of, but waterfall colosseum is like, idk shits crazy, react and improv
Yo gl on the race today Phantom! phanto274GL
oh Pog got tm 26 earthquake but my pokemon cant learn it Madge
excited to see the new settings
bye bye level 40 starter hello level 29 rhydon
That yuji naka quote aged like shit lmao
Me when I lose my bike
Yo a piece of shit Pog
Wtf is this pre chapter 1
@SwiftPichu_ i didnt do it, dont blame me
yoo, glad I could tune into a stream. Been watching the yt like none stop for the last week lmao (even the older videos)
Who needs the storeroom key lol
groove guy is the second worse to leave alive, first being mediguy
My most recent solo AP seed had Laki as the only partner for a while, made good use of 4FP Hurricane early on
you can clip without a partner
it's just a fairly precise angle against the wall
Don't make me do it Madge
I feel like these seeds can be fast as f
kinda but more lenient i think
like i think you can just push against the wall and slowly roll stick until it works
gonna see if i remember how to do it lol it's been like two years
Narrowed like that toas narrowly avoided getting pulverized by that hsmmer
Am i even following adam? Lmao
Fixed lol, jesus I suck at remembering
Cut to every panel having Cake
hi... wanna guess why I'm not asleep yet LuL the photographer is doing bs again
Isn't that tree a letter in vanilla too?
at least paper mario music is always a delight
I don't either, I was just confirming if that was normally a letter
and not hit a photographer with an electric fly swatter
ey, at least the gamescom is over. not like tomorrow is... monday.
in theory yet but but for the upcoming week
there is a map i remember finding in the rando discord that has a good route that already cuts through those rooms, i just dont remember where it is haha
because someone decided to take a vacation and I'm the only stand-in for some stuff so I'm not allowed to take my additional days off yet
monkeyPls at least the desert is a jam
okay just relearned how to do the pink station clip lol, it's basically gourmet guy skip but a little easier
Nope if it says clip high chances of nope
All these items for ch 7
Suspicious number of ch7 items we've seen...
You should be able to smash that
it's not really too hard just a little annoying lol
you have to slowly roll just barely left of up and get mario to push into a corner where he gets locked in and then just barely roll more after that and spin
I’m usually a YT viewer but just happened to see this stream
I’m guessing this is one of the Season 3 candidate seeds
Fish doesn't do much with these chapters but could still be required
well we know what the build is now
blowing up a wall, smashing it, same result
I really want the key one to turn out just one time
I forgot Charmy was in there
We'll see when I bring duct tape
how do these randos work? similarly to zelda rando with the cards being like dungeons and you try to be able to complete them?
So, what, 1 key and 1 seed?
@SwiftPichu_ that's my ass not my face
thank you for being appropriate in your terms, chu
They're fun to chill with also
Seeing Mario throw the seeds is funny
It's what I do to chill if I can mostly
I assume that attack does more damage if you're low health
never played a single paper mario game LUL
also rankings are updated now, there's 43 total people
Yeah Beest should know all of twilight lol
yeah I know, but his execution is so far up there, id have to win purely through gambles I think
Keep getting ads for the new Beetlejuice movie. Anyone planning to go see it?
I got a bug ad while the PiP was bugged
ah meaning I should join S3 PMR
Ooo there's a lot of people playing twilight. 43 players is good
I think isaac is the opposite side of being really good at tpr
cuz isaac probably isn't as execution dominant as beest but bro knows the logic like the back of his hand
I mean we can assume already lmao
I swear isaac almost always sub 2's
Flip the baby and pray it's boots
Becoming good at randos takes a whole lot of time and dedication to it
though part of it is luck
this looks like a go mode kinda thing to me
okay, 4 versions later we got a usable video and I can go sleep holy heck
@Rgamer0 in my case, I don't have time to get good over time
so i just rushed 50 seeds in 1 week
I think im doing ok for being really new at tpr
Did you join the qualifier 3 race?
Man I been seeing some early quals, it's crazy
It's just quals season this month
there's been loads and loads of rando tournaments and quals
and there's even more coming up
I think its gonna burn allot of people out lmao
I'm currently watching dk64 doing there's. Then there's Windwaker, and Twilight
Yeah they're burning people out with this lol
what do you mean you had a seizure? Are you ok?
Today sorta drowsy. Last night I slammed my head into the fridge and bit my lip in it
Woke up with rain and emt people. I should probably start listening to my body when it gives warnings
I see this pape might be going better than your pb?
Give bowser the ol 1 2 wap wap
Bowser coin flip on not healing pls
Yeah I had VERY few instances where he didn't and it was a miracle lol
Not enough to work on final bowser
Like this set up is janky
damn if only you have ultra boots :tf:
There's an angle where I see a win
You were so far ahead going into the first fight it was silly
just woke up, good luck phanto274Sleep
I’d imagine that a few would be gutsy enough to fight Bowser with this low level of equipment
Bowser just sucks to fight with
it’s looking like the gamba might be hunt for Ultra boots unless there is a required chapter that needs them
This set of chapters was rough on the Mario gear
I misplayed horribly at every turn lol
I hated the TP seed today. DNf'd at 2:30
Well it really doesn't help when you mark chapter 3 instead of 4. That sent me down a path of failure
Damn...maybe I should try out the seed...I saved it but was gonna do it later
In the middle I was like are we sure it isn't ch 7 lmfao
which is fine, I'll take a sub 1:40 any day
I was still in 2nd dungeon needing to fight boss, had not even been to 3rd dungeon and still only wood sword. At my pace wouldve taken me like 4 hours
I probably fought too much in ch1, but I knew I was light on power and stats
You’re my background dinner video for tonight phanto274Smile
About to get some dinner soon
I leveled up 2-3 times at the top XD
How important were panels in that seed? I didn't get super boots until late and then I forgot most of the time to check them
sorry haven't been paying a whole lotta attention, but was that an actual race you just did?
i knew it was xenoblade right away lmao
I'm gonna head out...do the seed I made and practice some jumps
oohh the first one was at the railroad station panel
would you take "no lyric anime ost" addditions for the playlist?
It has been cursed by Goombario
for TP what is mem card swapping?
oh? I dont like the idea of removing a memory card lol
I don't like the idea of risking corruption from doing that
Super boots and hammer this early mmm
besides the troll it was boots and hammer and two turtles
About to be flipping panels all day
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask. How do you throw items out of your inventory?
Gotcha, I was trying to figure that out on my own at one point and couldn't for the life of me
hello we missed you last seed
seems the game wants the hammer build
farming in a race? What's going on?
full compliment of partners, and was that Bombette at Ultra-rank?
GGs with the race, I took all that time and couldn't beat final bowser
It was my first blitz run ever so I'm not too upset with it. I'm looking forward to see how you played yours
yeah for one Mario is fully geared up
I was sad I couldn't find goombario phanto274Cry lueygaGoodLuck
I lost a ton of time because I forgot the panel by the dojo and I checked rip cheato super late
Anyways GL with the rest of the runs today! I'll be in and out lurking lueygaGoodLuck phanto274GL
can i squirt on tutenkoopa next?
Aight, I'm off to go make dinner. Good luck with the rest of your runs tonight Phantom
Yeah, I'll be down to give more races a go in the future
will he not heal while star rod'd
12 hp at that point right?
This one seems worthy for Goombario
Then again looking at how prologue checks will determine if chapter one is in the pool
I got the ultra boots in the race lueygaOops
triple dip was in the library in peaches castle
were you danger Mario in the race?
Time for round three the verse returns phanto274GL
quality of items are saying that this isn’t required so far
I like to watch on my tv but its connected to my wifes account lol
probably just like decision making, like when is it worth dipping a certain chapter or area and when is it not. at least for me I understand how the rando works just not how to make certain decisions
Do you ever feel bad that Laki's cloud looks all sad when you put it on lava?
how do I make github suggestions again?
how did you beat bowser without star beam KEKW
better question, how did he beat him without Goombario Kappa
Do the coins push that many badges out of the pool or something?
I think part of it is also less upgrades cause they're being shuffled into dead chapters too.
I know missing partner upgrades can be rough, which is why blitz had Ultra Stone start
oh you have ultra rank goombario!
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Great stream! hope to catch ya live again soon phanto274BLANKIES
I have 111,101 channel points... so close to only 1s lol
I was camping on twitch for 30 minutes waiting on the go live and it never gave it to me phanto274S
yeah, I saw it in my email that you fixed it
I forgot how to submit github fixes so Im like "just do this" LUL
swift and i were posting it at the same time
Obviously mine is basically tp only considering
I feel like I dont need the map, but sunday I NEEDED IT lol
oh btw name the horse swftpchu
how many are you doing today?
also shoutouts to 200 hours of TP rando
is it digital participation or irl run at pax?
I don't really know at this point KEKW
The bot is right, I did a run today so no shot I'm doing another one lmao
oh right, you can get all 4 poes here
L target and hold forward? didnt know about that
i do "ill remember this surely" notes
i think its harder in tp because you get so many hints at once
i already forgot the fyrus hint lol
in mm its only 1 at a time and they are pretty spread out
in my handwritten notes I have the always hints written out and if its dead I just write X
You've reached the isle of hidden skills
And he's old as shit community wise
I'm gonna be honest...I miss toph and scar in Evo instead
I beat it for the first time recently lol
so real expert commentary there lmao
My thoughts went to "sonic adventure 1"
GTAce has been doing nintendo championship right? making sure its the right guy
Was gonna ask how do you play a glitch filled game...glitchless
so he is a real gamer LUL
Name is so blue that it's bleeding blue phanto274Wave
btw we should prob start talking about the next AP only a few days left lol
Yeah, was kinda wondering if we were doing an async or another live one with Phantom at PAX
You got some owls to check lolz
I dont wanna do it on sunday tho. Id rather this saturday or the next one
Just keep riding me like you do
One of these days being degen is gonna backfire
Mostly surprised it hasn't in 5 years
go to the desert surely youll find the lantern there LUL
Damn so no sub 20 attempt
Oh hey she a dumb bitch just like me
do you know how to get kakariko heart piece without bombs?
I saw someone target the left and right side of the rock and they got it
Makes sense but also oh no community drama over it incoming
Who the fuck cares about logic
You get it or you don't
That doesn't make it a 50/50 lmao
@darkness3827 I'm mocking rando nerds who only think of logic and oh no breaking logic bla bla
I feel like breaking logic is more suited for pape than TP
Yeah there's nothing wrong with going out of logic, just you have to keep track of what item you skipped along the sequence
You almost always benefit from breaking logic as long as you know the logic
Any randomizer really. Cept maybe Minecraft idk if that has logic lmao
It's like wtf is the point lol
is sword required for anything in AG?
stallord you can just work attack right?
Can you do AG without clawshot?
well I need it for the one poe LUL
basement poe that you clawshot up for
Soon just go mode sword hunt
imagine going in without clawshot phanto274Facepalm
right fyrus you can just shoot arrows lol
sadly it's not like OoT where they just give you the sword cause they assume you already had it ;(
good thing I guess is it cant be on double clawshot checks tippiGiggle
that sounds like STAR to me
unironically btw: pmd red rescue team is kinda hard to master the cheevo set for c.c
so... you know about recruiting pokemon?
red rescue team doesnt allow you to recruit end stages of an evo line
and exp gains are not exactly easy
yeah as much as I love BRT it's kinda jank.
pair that with cheevos for starter mon has to reach lv.90 and partner mon needs lv.50 among other things, and you are lined up for lots of casual playing
Not being able to recruit if you have a full party also sucks
@Darkness3827 which I need to experiment with if you can use escape orbs on recruits
cus if you can, as weird as it would be, its a workaround
I think that's prolly my biggest complaint of the game. It makes going in with 4 characters kinda pointless
@Darkness3827 worse then 4 characters is the size limit for your team
bring an onix in? yea good luck recruiting much else
so I dont really mind it being a bit of a grind in that regard
PrideFlower happy to hear ya out
Redeads are stalfos change my mind
I liked the redeads of this game lots
For me they're just revamped stalfos Axl lol
nah you're fine with that thought pichu :D
still prefer them over OoT/MM's or windwakers in design
as much as they definitely are more annoying here
shoulda genned it to start with 0 IVs
lowkey hate the stalfos of this game - not for their fight itself, but more the fact you cant defeat them without explosives or ball and chain
yea I know they are like those
but given stalfos in OoT as an example let you deal with them as is, not to mention the small stalfos in 2D also being doable without bombs
its just the stalfos knights andd all that
YEP key logic be like that
my reason for knowing this is illy
cus you know - played OoTR / MMR and such
makes you learn key logic layouts and shit
especially Water & Fire temple hammer that in
ooccoo in AG is SO far out of the way 🤣
Niece got carpet burn on her knee and was crying from the pain, then the bandaid, then couldn't have more peroxide -.-
You always find a sword there gamer?
@AnniLyn2 hope your niece is now overall feelin better PrideFlower
She's like 2 so she'll cry no matter what lolz
yea well still PrideLaugh if my brain connected right as to what carpet burn is, its not bad ofc. but also like any other human, differences in perceived pain PrideFlower
What mode is this btw? Keys own dungeon?
keys own dungeon by looks ye
I love when you tell her no...she says take her with so you don't get lost
KEKW I forgot she does that
I wonder btw since the TP cheevo set, where else you in theory can just do nonsense with iron boots to deal damage KEKW
yea I think I know which room you're thinkin
link be like "drop it tutterJAM "
Drop it like it's hot? No drop it like it's heavy
local game shop got a copy of fire emblem path of radience... 220 big ones... and I got my copy for 20 in a gamestop bargain bin LUL
lmfao axl, good pulls you both had for that game by sound
if you guys wanna se his haul...
one item missing for the full haha sillies in this game btw PrideLaugh
cus we got lamp oil and we got bombs
lot of good stuff in there
I got Gale new and Colosseum used for like $20. Gale is like $200 cause I have the poster still and Colosseum is $100 iirc.
so what I immediately see axl? PoP Warrior Within is a good one
then below RE zero, is that spyro?
Time was basically like "you want swords? It's not here lul"
Unless this boss has a sword again
sorry, I am just havin big ol happy eyes over the picture axl sent
like AT LEAST 10 titles of that picture I wold be happy having in that version
What is you guys favorite insufferable unskippable scene?
@AnniLyn2 uhhhhhh we talking vanilla unskippable or rando "unskippable" ?
oh you mean in this game in particular
Mine would have to be watching fyrus freak out
Well at least there's a thumbnail idea for this particular seed
Nope just the image of an outline of a sword
I guess my favourite would have to be a certain bird in windwaker
Well @darkness3827 doesn't have to be
cus that bird AND THE FIGHT are a single cutscene
well any game it's what I said :P
for this game idk. Prolly Yeta
yeta is up there in being a cutscene boss fight yea
the good thing I will give yeta is that you can at least work the fight like as if its a fight
not like King Helmaroc in Windwaker
where ya just wait and become an aviary expert KEKW
If it wasn't this game...it would definitely have to be watching the windmill in OoT
windmill in OoT gets skipped for rando purposes though
you see it mildly start up in OoTR, then skip right past it
Were you trying to roll back under the 2nd one? I wasn't watching
and in Combo Rando it gets fully skipped for a GI cutscene
I have seen people do it, but I still need to learn it
as in literally just "get an item, get out, no cutscenes AT ALL"
No I have definitely seen Beest do it in rando
@isaac_twpr with or without irons on? could make a difference in how far you get flung by damage
fair - it does sound like precise, fast movement
I just realized you can't do the skip without a sword
@Jonxhas sorry I stepped out, glad you got a kick from that pic tho
@Axl_SR nah you're fine :D I LOVE nerding over pictures like that
we had a lil local games + console repairshop around here when I ways a kiddo, it was SUCH a vibe
His hair is down to earth too
like that 1 room you go in and see EVERYTHING and are just like "WOOOOOOOAH" type of shop
Finally a pointy thing and more bombs
sadly they had to close their shop SadgeCry
iamgine finding all 4 swords in the same room lol
4 swords.... that sounds like it could be the name of a game
Man...that does sound like it could be a game
I feel like not voiding would be faster, but could time it
100% normal irons movement should be worth, with fast irons could be similar to fast irons outdoing it?
like - how long is a voidout, 10s?
health in a HP chest KEKW
how is the sword not magnetized to the wall like the boots?
arrows also work despite their iron tips
or arrowheads to be more precise
I think midna is trying to tell you something lol
just cause it's metal doesn't mean it's magnetic. Maybe it's an aluminum sword lmao
sord is not made of iron, but magic
@FatPidgeyBirb yo the magic sword which is used to talk to people! IT WONT HURT THEM! PrideLaugh
I'm in clawshot go mode anyways
Master Link, did you know that swords are traditionally made to hurt entities such as yourself?
"Maybe you should get a shield." Well maybe you should get these yourself
@FatPidgeyBirb clearly you have not learned the ways of the CDI zelda game swords YEP
shields? they don't deal damage or solve puzzles so what good are they???
Shields are good for OoT, that's about it other than if a mirror shield is needed for puzzles
I know a dude who would rail so hard at the fact you didn't pick up that heart piece lmfao
Are you...by any chance...talking about AVGN?
@Rgamer0 you say that - MM shields kinda dont do shit except mirror for igos, OoT shields ONLY matter for Deku tree (hylian for adult, deku for kid) and Mirror (Spirit temple), Windwaker its again a "Mirror shield for puzzles" and in this its Toadpoli grotto (bought/found) OOOR MAYBE specific fight logic stuff 🤣
@AnniLyn2 nope, some dude name brett. He also thinks he knows everything about any given game and he sure doesn't
for tech? have you not learned about retargeting rgamer? goomeeDerp or you thinkin about scooting for hookshot GV bridge skip
@Jonxhas Don't you need any shield for Ganon in WW?
I'm sure he doesn't know about scorn
@FatPidgeyBirb yea, but any shield can do that
TotK has most useful shields cause you can stick flamethrowers to em
like - the reason I dont count for ganons shield for that fight is because WWR you normally clear like 90% of your seed anyway
meaning THAT YOU WILL HAVE A SHIELD
if you genuinely manage to have shield go mode in WWR, the seed was godawful I would dare say
shout outs to me being bad at puppet and forgetting I needed Boomerang one seed
i tabbed out what did you find?
when you need 4 Master swords, 3 bows, hookshot grapple hook MINIMUM for go mode puppet / ganon as is
the shield just tacks on top and usually happens
OR with some settings, WWR you just start swordless with shield
Or deteriorate... because I drank a lot of milk as a kid
what was the word you said?
Yo gl with the practice Phantom! phanto274GL
if it is what I think it is
swordless WW is fun until you need to do its version of cave of ordeals swordless
that's why you turn off Savage Labyrinth 😏
@FatPidgeyBirb that's what I said :P
Dude that's like mountain dew and milk
I don't want to be stuck in Laby for 10 mins when I could be doing something else that's more fun
yalls can have your crazy milk names, imma just enjoy not thinkin about milk for a day I guess 🤣
I had pilk and it's okay
I assume the P is for Pepsi and not what I originally thought when rgamer mentioned it LUL
like - I bet it isnt the worst people can do to fluids
Yes, the P is for Pepsi
as in it might be delicious
but also like... I really dont wanna try KEKW
(don't ask about what I thought it was instead)
@Darkness3827 yellow snow related perchance? KEKW
I mean people do ice cream floats in soda so you're mixing milk into your soda
I just watched the grumps try MD and milk...no thank you
@AnniLyn2 to be fair, they over-exaggerate a LOT when they do shit
Not voiding in that room is much faster. 7.4s was what I got
If arin doesn't overexaggerate anything...something is wrong
It's a type of shot lolz
THINK OF ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN POKE FOR 0 DAMAGE NOW tippiTap
wait it really deals damage to bulblins?
must be the ranged modifier bulblins got going
Yeah because you run into them before getting the bow
ALSO THINK OF THE BONEFISH AND BOMB FISH
actually has a roll in damageless ^
there should be like a random enemy late game that's like super vulnerable to slingshot like how the moles take double damage to hammer throw. That'd be funny af.
tryin'a think, where else could it play a roll
Well that was the dommy Roddy Mommy WotH
domrods like being on top of things catSpin
If you get Dom rod early...even revived...you got owls to check lolz
When you come back he gets jumpy in fear xD
are you really sure you should be handing out swords as carnival prizes???
@Rgamer0 such be the fate of people impostering tingle
I didn't even see that...but still :3
Arbiters Grounds I have returned to bargain with you but this time I come with the Master Sword
silly question for yalls: from generations 1 through to 3 (not higher, important kinda) favourite pokemon?
@Darkness3827 need more specific, I dont wanna have 6 mons same name KEKW
for reference: I decided to do the silly of naming EVERY rescue team member
also phanto274Smile I do think umbreon is potentially taken without words
and then evolve the eevee into whatever you want
is nintendo gonna be at pax?
@AnniLyn2 I dont think this close to echos of wisdom any game will get a remaster again
sneak peek stuff for new pokemon stuff probably given the release cycles that usually is at
maybe mario and luigi will be there?
depends on what their new direct stuff is covering I reckon
I hope starbomb is gonna be there to boost up the announcement for another mario party
bets it will be close to that in terms of what the hands on peeks might be
I could see epic mickey at a 3rd party booth maybe
honestly what I would be hoping for is a Pikmin 5 as silly as it'd be
yes we didnt hear shit about it and all
does TPC count as a partner lmao?
honestly fingers crossed they dont dig much mroe into noobisoft
this fight damageless was hilarious to do come to think
not if you're also doing swordless PrideLaugh
An actual pachinko machine of stallord..
@AnniLyn2 I dont need to imagine - it always feels like it
and then cus I rarely feel like there's good rng coming to the stalsoldier spawns, I get ricochet back into the bladetraps
What was stallord even before...a dragon?
stallord was what volvagia could have been if it wasnt reduced to big flying snek
and then phantom had to rummage treasure room
Wait no twinrova were still snake like
oh nvm, HC is full keys start with?
I was under the impression that it was still keys own dungeon or here, OoTR brain to that end
with treasure room being basically the equivalent to light trial
Make ganon play the organ again
isaac would probably know this better then I coulde ver, but: would junking treasure room turn HC into a front loaded affair for keys or no? ß
Link built like the pill sent to cure hyrule of its gsnonitis
could ever* man I hate this keyboard
we gettin clanker credits for sillies or nah tippiTap
Why does darknut spawn a giant ass hitbox shrn he pulls his other sword out
cause he cheats or some shit idk
Did you roll back in lolz
you know how those BN mobile games have been recovered? We now have a kingdom hearts game too lol
@Axl_SR you talking about the old version of union X?
that whole lore dump Kingdom hearts game with the MMO aspects on old phones?
or we talkin KH coded axl?
which that one was remade as Re:Coded on DS
No, we talking about Kingdom Hearts Magical Canvas
thats GENUINELY a KH game I havent heard of
did they skip one for lore stuff? 🤣
sounds like the name for a Kirby game
oh is it time to say GG already?
You have any tips regarding fighting ganon 1v1?
@Axl_SR I guess the good thing is its "just a picross game" - no way you could lore dump with that 🤣
there is unique key blade lore tho KEKW
The quick spins are becoming dumb... been having more trouble doing them
@Axl_SR oh.... my.... god.... okay, into the rabbit whole I go, time to read up on the nonsense HahaSweat
Use to be able to do them better but lately it's been shit
im trolling Jon, I have no idea KEKW
Jon did you just say rabbit whole
Do you have any advice on last locating early game progression
because with Kingdom hearts lore, you dont have rabbit holes
you have rabbit WHOLES cus if they find a detail to make matter, they BANK on it
Every qual I've played so far I feel like I've missed the early game chains and do every other early thing
you all have heard about how CONVOLUTED KH lore is right? KEKWBag
And I keep losing tons of time to it
Can never enter arbiters without a sword phan
@Jonxhas eh stop acting like it's MGS or something :P
@Jonxhas btw that emulator is super rough. I recommend using JoyToKey to map keyboard keys to a controller
@Darkness3827 🤣 you read up on it and tell me your head dont hurt - MGS lore is easy compared
@Axl_SR I wont play, just read up - never played union X either, just read up on the rough lore about it and the 5 keyblade grandmasters with their box and shit
I mean like... the fact that you're looking for the BK asks your lady choice is death sword..
KH lore isn't hard to convoluted, it's just super stupid cuz the devs keep making their lore irrelevant and then claiming it's relevant
drop 8 "normal games" and a JP ONLY PHONE MOBILE GAME (technically 7 and 2 since Coded was JP only phone before DS got Re:Coded)
I've never played any KH game. Ik it and MGS are like the most convoluted stories lol.
INCLUDING FINAL MIX VERSIONS OF GAMES TO FILL EXTRA LORE IN
release them in a convoluted "as you go order"
I got around to learning kak gorge double claw wolf jump
and tie in a 12 years plot lore wise backwards PLUS INCLUDE TIME TRAVEL LIKE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
And the ljas for the beside castle town owl chest and desert one
thats your roundabout of why KH lore sucks to understand
I'm sure there's a big MSG sub-plot in MGS given how dumb the plot gets.
at LEAST MGS lore doesnt time travel
I mean all the games are out of order
I wont say MGS lore is easy to piece together
because that definitely would be false
but yeah they're pretty restricted to the games they're in.
but its something you can piece together
Now the game with the easiest to understand plot is Sonic 06. It retcons itself. The end.
Imma have to update the tracker huh?
I remember tryna piece together the game in chronological order tho and it's very confusing lmao.
to be fair, I think most of the MGS game piecing together is trilogy based sorta
So...do you think that when it comes to the hints...season 1 is stronger than actual strong hints?
Getting claw or spinner when you don't need it are super nice
with KH games its "play this PSP GAME FIRST" for lore start (which was like the 5th game or so in released games or something
AND THEN PLAY IT IN A CERTAIN WAY
and then you got others which you technically have to play side by side cus we sure do love when its a story line which shapes a rough hourglass shape
anyway tldr: KH lore sucks, time travel is a convoluted copout mess of a lore tool
Wouldn't that be 12 of them since it's 24 bugs in total?
WAY too much to think about to make time travel not implode your storyline
hell - Zelda games fall into that trap too with both OoT / MM and with TotK in the most recent entry of it
I'm tryna think of a time travel game with good lore. IG Chrono Trigger. There aren't many lmao.
Chrono trigger I think did it the best yea
Agitha had nothing for one seed and I kept finding bugs evo17Flip
in OoT you somehow have other people knowing of stuff which happened but it happens in reverse order during gameplay
Does MM count as time travel? lmao
MM technically just cuts link into being a blank shape no one knows of
MM is a 3day groundhog day, I'd count it
with the biggest thing being the fact you keep your stuff and certain events are 1 time only
well that is lovely... the Taiko game I bought a month ago is coming to all other platforms and has 120FPS. Wouldve loved to have that on PS5
plus your inventory not resetting for reasons of gameplay / QoL rly
but I did get it for just 20 bucks tho
@Axl_SR hey - having the legacy version to me sounds like potentially not dealing with early remaster bugs
Stick with the ps2 and 360
I have never wanted a PS2 or 360 lol
but I mean it doesn't really effect anything plot related. All it really does is give Link extra time. The plot wouldn't change at all if Link did everything within the initial 3 day window I don't think. Or am I misremembering stuff?
Link looks like the gum and casing of hubba bubba
@Darkness3827 1st off, you can NOT 100% in a single cycle ever
as certain items are received to late to do things with them
then you have a questline which splits into 2 branches early (and then 2 more at the end of it for a path)
the MINIMUM cyclecount you can reach is 4 including 0th cycle
cus you need to save the bomb lady for all nights mask
and you need to do Anju and kafeis questline twice (which results in not saving bomb lady) for letter turnins
if you take glitches into account using duplication of items, you COULD potentially skip a 3rd normal cycle
by duplicating the letter in question
OR say, by playing the Wii U Version and using the debug menu
but at the point of considering Wii U you're considering wild single console shit
and afaik duplicating that letter is a bit more difficult then duplicating other items with vanilla item menu behavior
yeah I moreso mean from a plot perspective than a gameplay perspective but yeah. Like if Link had 2 weeks to get everything done and no time travel does that change the plot of the game at all really?
@Darkness3827 I dunno - the plan for MM according to some beta / debug digging sounds like it was supposed to be an entire week of ingame stuff happening after another
but then time crunch for release compressed it to 3 days
she understands I'll Help in dog tho
as said though lore wise, the biggest "sin" you could give MM is the fact that your big transformation mask get or say, ranch defense on day 2 night after aliens on day 1 result in different rewards given different items you have
also Ik I am ramblin, my bad 😅
more thinkin cus its a wall of text PrideLaugh
also I dunno how my brain just now connected it: nice 4:3 game layout
dont know why I just now realized that
paper mario is like a weird mix between 4:3 to 16:9 right?
3.6 period (I think thats what it'd be called?)
yeah I think 9x5. Cause 9x6 would be 3x2. so 1.666 would be one less than that.
the repeating number bit I know as period hence the question 😅
cus there's a math term for it, but I dunno if its the same between english and german
I know there's a symbol for repeating decimal which is a line over the repeating part but idk if there's a term for that.
@Darkness3827 thats what I was thinkin of yea
@Jonxhas according to a quick google: "The bar that is over a repeated decimal is called a repetend bar."
we love castle town talkbox traps
I wonder how many people you'd have to talk to for not rolling to be faster LUL
plus at that point, you'd then just wolf and rush past them that way
which would I reckon be faster then if you end up with 2 talkboxes average
excluding the fact that agithas door LOVES to talk to you
no, I mean the person on agithas window and the sign to her domain KEKW
also I HATE how if you are wolf in castle town you cant hide at giovani's and then warp in vanilla, even after hiding at giovani's for a quick double dip
did you trade cause you have wooden sword?
jumpslashing the fire slugs means you will get hit by their spherical fire blast more often then not
cus link loves to step too close to them
it'd be funny if you took damage fighting fire enemies with wood sword
then again it would also have to mean that your wooden sword would just light up like fireworks
I think left side you can do a rolling jump or something across the wall?
or better yet wood sword burns away and you're back to swordless LUL
I keep boots on for this room since it removes a point of failure and costs less than a second
god fast boots is nice I wish that was a casual mechanic :(
I think it's more consistent to use boots for sure
@Darkness3827 vanillamizer option when goomeeDerp *genuinely more joking then actually asking for it*
Also with fast boots probably not even faster to do the jump slasn
cus like - vanillamizer fast boots would make iron boots segments (and if turned on as well, spinner) be so fun to mess around with
the only "timeloss" you get from irons is putting them on / off with fast iron boots, right?
You can just side hop to avoid the time loss of that
A lot of this dungeon has you putting on boots in midair for free
Such as when dropping from a ceiling
There's only a few spots where boots has to be equipped from the floor
just tryin'a think if you have to put them on on flat ground that potential target camera movement is the only big one right?
There's like 2 spots where you have to land
Cuz a magnet will just pick you back up
Last I remember was wooden sword
love this fight casually btw - when you accidentally doubletap A and instantly take damage for just pressing a button twice
🙃 totally not me being salty about damageless shenanigans PrideLaugh
Talking to the goron elders heals you
I got healed in my route video
@isaac_twpr it would make sense, I mean - specifically MM Grandma long story also does so in MMRando cus of how the specific Getitem handles itself
link that's not how you open doors
its not a fll heart, but it did give 1
better in that regard to tatl even
also rather certain with bomb arrows that you can corner skillshot from below skipping the irons ceiling there, no?
They should get rid of the signs and make all the hints come from Midna
so then you'd have to listen to her.
bets someone had thought of that though, ngl
like how for OoTR TO THIS DAY people are like "how about navi giving out hints"
Nobody is better than fludd though
when you got no real good way to call upon navi hints without sarias song
and even then navi is mostly just talkin nonsense
\o/ return of trans pride link
PrideLaugh wanted to take a bath
Time to watch fyrus freak out again
Midna giving hints would just be wind waker rando
@nozomup windwaker rando having hints is the most hilarious thing to me
Boat just dumps exposition on you
like - how far you STILL have to go out of your way for hints in WWR to me always makes them not worth kinda
it's funnier coming from Mr Hoho tbh
I never got to finish wwv
I don't like the standing in place for a really long time as soon as the race starts
@isaac_twpr summary of why WWR hints to me => fuck hints, just go play game
Idk about you, but I am on the move
I'm getting better about not standing still when doing hints
avg extra time an hour (excluding skill ranges to decrease) yea
Good players still finished like 2-1 hours
cus you cant skip long checks once you can do them as easily
Unless you add more dumb checks
and as much as execution definitely lowers time a lot
Ice block required => no one has fun
@isaac_twpr wdym, viewers LOVE that KEKW
Too easy for crappy last locations
its like how in MMR everyone hates doing pamelas father check
was that faster than the 7 skillz qualifier rando?
tippiNotes time to start noting down the chain in my head
I almost sneezed out my popcorn...
@AnniLyn2 wdym sneezing out popcorn 🤣
I'm eating popcorn and had to sneeze lolz
Had to hurry and swallow the popcorn because I felt it... made it in time
@AnniLyn2 🤣 well I stand by it: dont sneeze out popcorn KEKW cant be good for your respiratory tract 🤣
Eldin stockave... home if hidden skills
but can you get a perfect score? goomeeDerp
Getting a perfect score use to soft lock you out of getting the reward for plumm
It got patched and found a few weeks ago
I watched it happen to someone
come to think another silly question given plumm game: cursed check plumm game perfect score reward?
and then double minigame rewards so that if you hit perfect score 1st round, you get given both items?
being evil today are we jonxhas?
From what I understood, max score possible is a separate reward, and it would give you that one, but since you had max score you couldn't get the 10k one
@nozomup that sounds about nintendo sillies
Only need 10000 so bleh lolz
but yea me brain just out here being a silly with the double rewards - could technically apply to iza if skipping iza help would be a feasible option and then giving both on the pot shooting, plumm game -> get both if perfect score 1st round - dunno if there even is much else on the minigame front in this game
oh thats a fancy lantern fire color
I gotta say it again, that tunic color scheme is fire
pink flame also fits the color scheme
you just wind up on the surface when you transform
I aint phantomBot, I dont need to turn grammar that sideways 🤣
what if instead of going local caching route
you'd instead have "export cosmetics" options?
which then exports the general settings
It's a good palate but I'm serious his hair looks like hubba bubba
cus Imma guess, music plando isnt an option
or you no longer made it random and just forced this to be Link's color scheme for everybody!
So any of you guys remember how pink that was lolz
Saved cosmetics are on my list but I have been busy for 12 months lol
let link be in his himbo era with this pink for everyone tbh
as with any mod based project PrideFlower it takes the time it needs
I mean is anything in ordon
northern desert is the bulblin blockade portion only?
just tryin to mark it in my head cus so far I didnt really make tooo too much sense of the hints for regions in this game yet and all
and then wolf + corner chest on that ledge
since bulblin camp is its own region (including the AG entrance chest I reckon)
cus otherwise you could have cases of going past bulblin camp for 1 check but not a dungeon
Ag entrance chest is part of bublin camp
@AnniLyn2 it would make sense for hint purposes
Poe there is also a check
Figured it would just be part of GD
But it's more so each one is a blob
Bulbin camp is it's own zone
Entrance rando going to make things very difficult though
yea true - gonna guess that poe is also region-tied to bulblin camp though
It's just dead for every seed
So idk what the future will look like
honestly I'd just keep currently established regions
the big one rly is if you count doors leading to rooms inside them as part of the region the door is from or as part of their OG region
cus by memory that is the exact problem combo rando MMOoTR ran into for hint problem purposes
as you can now even have single dungeon doors become entrances
if you let it go that crazy anyway
I am thinking we try to be reasonable, but for extreme entrance rando everything is just based on what it is now
I've been wondering if outside the spring would count as part of the spring or part of LH
I wont be able to judge ER decisions too too much anyway :D
The 2 checks outside the spring are Lake Hylia
my big input rly would just be "let it make sense" as in "grottos leading somewhere => part of the region the grotto entrance is from
and for possible dungeon boss/miniboss rando similarily
aka "count shuffled boss to new parent dungeon" for region rly
the big problem for minibosses being aerolfos in CitS I reckon
given its double door entrance/exit limiting it a lot there for simpler forms of ER
only being able to 50/50 with the Dino thing from Snowpeak
oh I missed it what was it?
which bets all of which things the TPR people already thought of tippiTap
Midna sold the master sword behind link's back to get that orange rupie.
@Darkness3827 worse - the hylians of old didnt need it guarding the sacred realm, so they sold it KEKW
It's over the arch thing I think
I have a setup, but hard to describe
Did you ever do star 1?
in terms of density I reckon its faster?
cus depending on items obviously seed dependant
You don't get to leave until like 3 minutes in
So you aren't getting any new info and the tradeoff is you get 3 checks
the check to hint density is the big dent
if its something good, you obviously feel kinda bad ish
In a 1v1 you can probably just copy your opponent's play
it rly would have to be like a path item thing
Or you can do opposite on purpose for gamble
rly it comes down to item placement if early ordon is worth
it's nice when that doesn't take 2 minutes
If you get lucky you get further into logic than them faster and if not you're behind
if you have a sphere 0 path item here hard locking progression
Flip a coin to keep people on their toes
and the hint is not early
then you sit there giggling if you did this early
you do get overall though what I am playin at
Grottos removed was just an idea on reducing overworld
eh - indifferent to me that check rly
the biggest bleh is the long walk to the grotto, not the check itself I feel like
If iza and plumm were good... does that mean Springwater rush is helpful too?
You got a rod... take it and run ya know
what would be hilarious is if 2nd fishrod is in spring
It can be bomb bag or bow if they aren't locked behind themselves
also the bomb bags so far would be interesting
If you did BK... you'd immediately had to gohma?
Temple of time in this I think got restricted from locking dungeon behind Big key
I think if gohma could have a key it would be like fire temple from oot
that whole "I do to an extent like the possibility of early boss in a dungeon" from OoT Fire temple
ToT does have a play where you rush the midpoint sign
Yeah only sometimes have a key
Man oot music is just sleep aid
you could do the swordless strat if you wanted to hate yourself more
I did this once and was extremely happy
is the straight on easier then a far angle?
Oh I thought that option was turned off isaac
This is why I don't learn ToT lol
No small keys on bosses is turned on
this to be fair I think is the hardest trick execution-wise over the throws here?
tbf that steep angle is for the swordless strat originally KEKW
I'm gonna figure out a way to do that jump every time without fail
this one i use 2 cues most people don't normally use
you're standing a bit far to the right for one, and the two pillars that the door bisect, i put the far one off screen
@TheGlubbers if its visual cues, cant hurt to tell tippiTap
no that's way too far right
standing pos too far right i mean
see those dark spots on the front of the step
Would you ever play mk with your subs again?
with the black dots on the edge?
i put links left foot, when facing the door, on the black dot on the edge that's currently under his right foot
hylian or zora tunic matter for your visual?
it's lenient enough that it doesn't matter
didnt see it, had snipping tool in front 😅
and you mentioned it being visualized on ZSR, so I can find it
There needs to be a setup you can do regardless of health
@Jonxhas i just cut the pillar to your left of the door down the middle and throw from there, no hearts needed
@isaac_twpr I mean - bets we can find a lineup on 3 hearts from the 10 hearts
@TheGlubbers noted - need to see it visually though so gimme a sec while I am rummaging ZSR related
whats that trick called, early heart piece 1/2 or something?
also i didn't realize you had dom rod
why did you do statue throws if you had dom rod KEKW
oh fair enough, its also just a cool strat
2nd heart 1st row see that line of bricks behind it?
it seems to line up with the edge of the 2nd heart outline rather well even on 3 hearts
@Jonxhas okay hear me out, because this looks like someone used my old visual cue for hundo and didn't know what the cue actually was KEKW
you see how in that picture, there's a pillar on either side of the door, and the one on the left side of the screen is cut down the middle?
i have an identical cue, with the right pillar, on the other side KEKW
yea I get that :D just tryin to see if there's other cues on top of that you could use
yeah i can phantom, i might still have the old pics
@Jonxhas this is super fair, to each their own
I see the 2nd heart being vertically aligned in the middle of the block edges
I am curious if my silly bogus idea on the 2nd heart would also be a reasonable lineup
you might also be able to use how the like little spire things on the fence line up with the lines on the pillars but idk if that's reliable. That's the first thing I noticed tbh.
cus if I see this not too wrongly, the edge of the 2nd heart backdrop lines up on the dot with the edge of that long brick 3rd row from top of the screen there?
i'll also get the standing positions cuz they've also got relatively obvious cues, at least imo
y'all, it is not that precise KEKW
Muted but what is the argue?
statue throws cue stuff chu KEKW
ToT 1st heart piece domrod skip statue throws yea
i legit opened an image of a cue and it looks exactly like something i might've sent ike like 3+ years ago for hundo KEKW
@Darkness3827 the 1st when following fence from right of screen to the left?
or how the far left one lines up with where the 10th heart is supposed to line up. Cause you could use that if you didn't have 10 hearts.
@theglubbers that's because you did, bitch I was in his learning streams and it sucked ass KEKW
@Darkness3827 yea definitely a drawback of any setup if its reliant on certain amounts of resources KEKW
even if health is in this sense then a resource
just imagine "crazy starting items" suddenly having 1 heart only
that sounds like a recipe for alcohol poisoning
I do love that center pillar line-up btw glubbers, just being silly on lookin at other bits of the picture
oh! another one glubbers (yes still peekin at that image) - bottom left corner of that screenshot, the edge of the dark tile lines up with edge of screen there?
or is that more a screenshot cut corner thing?
@Jonxhas if we're gonna figure out every single visual cue possible, the 5th heart is dead in the middle of the pillar to the right of the door.
@Darkness3827 yea I am currently on that "where's waldo" KEKW
idk if you're paying attention to chat but we have like 10 different visual cues for you to use for the statue throw btw Phantom
oh you're getting a novel because i'm giving you cues for where to stand and what angle to take
novels are great for that PrideLaugh
@TheGlubbers make sure to put our cues in too never know which one Phantom finds most useful :P
literally the best thing about rando silly gremlin strat theorycrafting imo
PLUS with rando learnings, those types of novels help new players greatly tippiFlower
takes away from the "knowledge on tricks" skillceiling towards a execution learning curve
oh i should probably learn more about S1 rando shouldn't I KEKW
i did one seed and that's all, my monitor for my console has been broken for a few days now
truuuu i know all of the checks in all of the dungeons too
S1 is what, Keys own dungeon, Fused Shards for HC, HC Keys start with?
QoL starting items really I hear
cus I reckon hawkeye for peeks, Shadow Crystal/Horse Call for movement
yea so a QoL starting item set excluding magic armor and then only godawful OW checks like block puzzle grotto are junked
(which imo isnt godawful but for racing definitely is up there in HUGE bottleneck cus no one likes to do a 3min 1 check thing
twilight palace doesn't exist in rando right?
PoT can exist, in this setting its not possible to roll
Zant Heart countainer is taken out from rolling dungeon reward
or if like stallord, there's a 2nd possibility now for that, that being junked
otherwise you coud have 3 dungeon items req but 4 dungeons needed cus AG slap on sorta
cus the Twilight Mirror warp isnt a "start with" warp
ohhh not required to get up here then
cause that's how you get the earing
wdym, you dont like having easy trick access to OoL endgame of the seed? KEKW
Early boss key to make up for it prayge
cus I feel like the big one which happened this seed is just a case of having had access to OoL endgame items with GM
eh KEKW just get lucky on 1Snowpeak small Snowpeak goomeeDerp
you dont need more then 1 if you get lucky with tricks, do ya?
Well I'd automatically assume it's not here cuz that would be too nice for rando
Oh so it has to have something
Dungeons are prioritized for foolish, so if a dungeon has nothing it will appear
So if it's not barren it has to have something preventing it
you're arguably making it harder by going right to left with your targets instead of left to right
very silly question in nonsense regards this
the "safer" part of the LJA then become earlier in the reaction time, it's something that depends on how confident you are the rang goes oob and how quickly you react
but if you were to have single clawshot equipped, find 2nd
does it auto update the equip in rando?
Back then it was, I saw Adam do it cmdrglSad
or do you still have to re-equip clawshot in that instance?
I get why it happens, just thinkin cus it could be done and such
KEKW it does feel very weird to have it be "i saw beest do this" and "i saw jeez do this", chu
instead of "i watched otti" or "i watched adam"
Yeah glub it just makes us see how old we are around here lol
I mean that's a good way to learn random ass tricks though
nozo, i'm not saying they aren't, i'm saying i've been around since before they were cracked and when they were learning KEKW
I mean - I get exactly where pichu's comin from overall KEKW
well, i've been around longer than jeez's been learning, not beest tho, he's been around for like 3 months longer than me
its like how I am like "oh I saw pushy do this or that" or "oh look at gigopler" with Majoras Mask KEKW
I don't know allot of tp runners sadly
I just know beest cuz I watched him way back before
Otti and Adam is like, what beest and nimzo is right now
dw nozo i swear at this point half people know me as "the"
yeah twitch wouldn't let me make my name The.Glubbers or i would
well - if you dont mind, I'll stay on glubbers KEKW
i don't mind at all lmfao
I got locked out of my nozzly account cuz of twitch funny
cus as much as "The." sounds hilarious given "just get the point!" sorta stuff, glubbers is easier to memorize
also what the fuck did you do with that loadzone
I mean tbf that's not really the game's fault lmao
you're not really expected to do that.
The loading zone is tied to yeta
so with other words the missing yeta actor caused that LZ nonsense
But you can still hit it
You have to reload the area for it to work
cutscenes gonna be longer than the fight.
@nozomup whats more hilarious I feel like is the fact you can still store the LZ traversal
she's looking into the eyes of the camera
so correct me on item placement please phantom, but Eldin Field center grotto -> Ball & Chain, Plumm -> Spinner, Eldin Stalfos big chest -> Lantern, South HF Spinner chest -> 2nd Rod, Snowpeak Ruins for 2nd Clawshot?
it'd be funny if it was like dom rod or somethin
and dungeon Clear order by logic would be Snowpeak and then split between GM and ToT?
Spring would HAVE to be because domrods were late in logic
cus your DomRod ws behind Lantern
so the other has to have been double clawshot lantern locked as well
the one you had was from Domain lit lantern chests yea
it sounds like a weird edge case of requirements to go mode
I'd assume given iron boots were behind double clawshot in South HF double clawshot chest
could it be the swords? idkr how the hints work.
cus the Iron boots you NEED to have for domain lit chest
Swords typically aren't paths but they can be I think
so its a split sphere-wise there between lantern + iron boots or lantern + double clawshot I reckon
DomRod was Domain Lit Lantern chests
needing iron boots from HF Double Clawshot chest
so your first domRod being in Spring makes sense sphere wise
cus then you dont need Iron Boots
yea and its before Iron Boots logically
v the domrod you have is 1 sphere deeper cus its after Iron Boots
zelda float lower this fight would go by so much faster.
I love when zeldanon does that
by far the best ganon in presentation IMO
yeah I wish it was much less wait wait wait wait hit
but I mean tbh that's a lot of zelda bosses
like - since Agahnim, wait -> play has been pretty up there
and in 3d it has established itself a lot for Zelda games to have wait -> hit -> evade loops
so as to make it a learnable experience
it's already 11 where I'm at just about :P
sent ya the items which I think explain the Spring path to Armogohma
it just was deep as fuck in terms of logic
very much "go mode items" filled
want me to send a video of goku vs vegeta to make it an actual manga
oh god its shit and fart isnt it
i had an AD pb for literal years where the filename was "cumsock"
Wasn't that the same dungeon set as another seed earlier?
given "what if no spoiler" and shit
i am too, the start of the run also goes "it gets reset on bit but fuck it why not, not like i'm gonna hit bit anyways"
does ordon being barren include your house?
So this is literally the same seed in terms of dungeons but with different random checks
Sounds like a good time for a first
👍 didnt get to see the item, just saw you be quick on text
Did they ever do One Step From Eden I wonder?
the throw rang button but no go whee button SadgeBusiness
@TheGlubbers so far gales is a "stay" button, no "GET OVER HERE" button KEKW truuuue
i'm learning a decent bit about how to read logic just by listening to you talk about the seed
Way to many "Eldin this" checks
It's one where you tap B to do an attack for the jump
just genned a seed, it gave me "artistic midna" KEKW
the fact it can come up this far 🤣
there's 10 in the right side grave from entrance
the one on the right spawns a 10 rupee
the one which isnt the poe basically
Wonder if that spawns on the Rutela layer
usually I only pick that up in casual if I am lacking money for either hylian or bomb bag
I would route that in => red rupee at LH for guaranteed Flight by Fowl
@isaac_twpr curious also if its a repeatable one
or if its a 1 off yellow rupee, should anyone ever consider freestanding rupee shuffle stuff
which I mean - its rando, so probably at some point
Doing good, hosted a random tournament this weekend at 2D Con
I way overprepared for it, I have enough left over to host 2-3 more tournaments lol
so in terms of hints (this is me askin silly stuff bets) its 3 path, 4 barren?
You know what a random tournament is? A lot of people don't
Yeah, every match is a different game. I had 48 ready and only used 10 lol
Nobody ever expects Sonic Adventure 2 to show up on a tournament, but it did! 😆
@Scarrien thats a solid speedgame last I recall
I thought you said it was for 2D Con :P
It was the multi-player mode, yeah. I had all four options in the rotation, but only Sonic/Shadow came up
how long the avg rando run?
No sword hint for barren dungeons
tryhard mode is lame for practice imo anyway
Since it's bow locked at the top
wasnt wolf good for most of this? KEKW
can we have them work more like with diobaba? KEKW
just imagine the mess this could be with buying shield logic again KEKW
last area where you were with horse
Water clothes and water lure and water dommy Roddy Mommy
And now this shield which should have been wet
you ever just see the hylian shield on a mountain? hill? Big ass rock?
and you got 2nd domrod in lantern cave
which needs smash boulders to open
its a very weird logic roundabout rn KEKW
I think I know what you're thinkin, also feel like the distance might be too far though KEKW
yea if it would be like down 3 times as much, maybe
the rare double stars game option rn hoooly
ima head out thanks for stream
Right, there is a max of 1 hinted-barren dungeon
I like that midna hair. Makes me think of Super Mario Sunshine or something
happy to say that now that everything fell into logic, I can make sense of the spheres KEKW
what a sphere braintrain without that 1st bombbag
hey - good thing so far is that GM is flat in spheres for keys KEKW
want me to catch you up?
Yeah you got it right near the lantern maze
wanted to say - it mostly would be so you could get snowpeak ooccoo out the way
but like - that would mean you needing spinner i n there locking ball&chain
like - it'd need some funky logic chain to be that way
can you test if that yellow rupee respawns?
and you had picked it up
just was curious for my silly brain whether repeatable or not
it'd be a disgusting rupee farm given how loaded with cash this game is yea
would need some insane item order for that to matter
the item to item path being MIA is rough PrideLaugh
or if its items you dont have, it'd give rough logical direction what not to do potentially
shoutouts to 2 2domrod runes havin been something by the way
Very close to just barren dungeons
just was on a short brb hence
Just only ball and chain missing, know where a sword is
and then technically a sword but that could as an example just be in lanayru spring
grove grotto was lantern, if the past ToT entrance stuff counts as grove, you also got clawshot there sphere 1
both lantern and the clawshot from there sphere 1 actually
Hyrule tackle and bait shop about to recieve visit from hero
I dont see a single clawshot lock thus far goomeeDerp
it was Eldin Lantern Cave Lantern Chest
Wishing you luck for the rando at PAX! Excited for Speedtember too c:
you know which day during pax the rando will be shown at pax?
surely its not gonna be these 2 outside chests
@TheGlubbers tippiFlower found the event PrideLove
yeah, sunday 9/1, it's at like 1:30pm isn't it
that's a very solid slot yeah
imma guess as well that the GDQ schedule shows times in timezone adjusted right? tippiTap
actually i think GDQ shows it in EDT KEKW
eh not like spr uses sword damage really
the only bit where damage could come in is the lizalfos lookin thing with ball&chain, no?
well - there are optional requirements as per usual with combat
cus combat is a variety of things per enemy respectively and all that fun stuff
no literally every enemy in snowpeak is best taken down with BA or B&C KEKW
what I am tryin to say is not "best way to take out" but "fight options" glubber PrideLaugh
cus I mean - toadpoli grotto has some fucked ways to deal with them
oh yeah this games just great at being versatile with combat
its not like OoT Ganon 2nd phase where everything deals damage except the last hit has to be master sword 🤣
but rather a case of "some enemies are specific, others are variety
cus technically most combat in these seeds is solved from start via wolf link
as much as wolf link in many cases isnt preferred
I dont mind wolf link, just that his damage doesnt help much for bosses, and it would take some insane shit for say wolf link v Aerolfos
or Wolf Link only dark hammer
the type of stuff which can come up every like 100 seeds I reckon
I think it does? but the clawshotless method is a lower level trick
which after doing it for the TP cheevo set, I could see calls for it being base logic without clawshot
It is in logic with just sword
that kak sword sounds more convenient
I remember one seed I was in kak about to do lakebedtemple and I was like "how crazy would it be if i just had a sword" and then I boomeranged a sword out of the rock, was pretty cool
thats some fun sphere density holy
I didnt feel like blowing it up so I just did the boomerang thing
where you grab it through the rock
so then you got (win conds included, keys not accounted for) a 5 sphere seed here, damn
obviously based on key layouts, spheres might be different
i dont think a 5 sphere seed is possible
the smallest ive seen is 8
@nozomup I did not include the key placement
hence why I am sayin 5 - with keys, probably 6 to 7
well, most items stop showing up after sphere 5
in this seeds case we're at sphere 3 for all the items
the main items that can show up late are second claw, spinner, and swords
unless I noted down a sphere the wrong way
thats based on my data analysis
but its only at like 100 seeds so
yea so for the sphere 3 items in this seed, you got spinner and ball&chain at desert
sphere 2 had 2 prog swords, both fish rods, clawshot, memo
sphere 1 had clawshot, hylian shield, 2 bow, 1 sword, lantern, zora armor, domrod 2
sphere 0 had hidden skill, domrod, rang, boots, bombs
and then secondary bombs also in 3
sphere 0 and 1 having a bulk of items
100 seeds is rather solid given average item total for TPR is what?
would guess barely reaching 200 in total?
uncommonly, I had a point where the seeds I genned snowpeak had like 15 items
Snowpeak and GM I feel are both relatively common given logic requirements
next after would be ToT, Lakebed, Forest, after that AG and CitS
it would have to do dungeon rewards first yep
cits is the dungeon that requires the most things iirc
if you want to full clear it '
it doesn't require that much if right side is dead
It used to not have even chances for each dungeon, but they should be even now
for Full clear, 2 swords, irons, spinner, 2 clawshots come to mind for CitS
rang I dunno where that comes in
you need rang to do right side
to get past the fake floors
AG on the other hand is sword, spinner, lantern, way of dealing with stalfos (so ballchain or bombs)?
funnily enough btw that sword is earlier sphere then the one at Lanayru field OR the one at Faron Field 🤣
city: iron boots, 2 swords, 2 claws, boomerang  LBT: 1 claw, iron boots, zora armor, 1 sword, bomb bag  AG: 1 Claw, Lantern, spinner, 1 sword
technically no swords for LBT now
you also need boomerang or bow
smash things for logic in AG since Stalfos nozo
is it not in logic to just climb up and spinner across
cuz you can do that without any tricks
@nozomup before that, you have poe hunt
you do need it for that 1 room I guess
he usually dies in 1 second
if it was about the ones before Deathsword, I'd also still say you logically need it
depending on key / item layout
but illogically 100% you can just reverse towards the trove and deathsword
no way to void up in this room right?
was silly thinkin that the thingy, whatsitcalled lasereye thing woulc be a nuisance
Statistically you usually get to continue up
so phantom - what does the manganime novel of glubbers tell ya tippiTap PrideLaugh
since we're here and all KEKW
i realized this room spawns spiders when you open that door
so I never go hint first
yo mortal draw in sphere godknows what 🤣
Are you sure that is the trigger?
I don't know what else would spawn them
I feel like I saw them sometimes even before hints
if you double enter you also get them in here I think?
how the fuck do they spawn them
oh nvm this is after spinner use, right
that mortal draw is up in sphere 4
being all smug about its quadratic sphere number
time to get drunk on the silliest drinkin game KappaPride
that sounds right, cuz i'm pretty sure what i've done is spin attack MD
idk how jump strike works for it
mortal draw was last picked up
granted, the last time i did that strat was uh, before sphere logic KEKW
I think JS is an instant 2-cycle if you just do one JS each time
I mortal drawed twice without fairy tears
also I lost count on the amount of hole blockades by armogohma KEKW
I think you do Jump slash => talk to midna to put sword away => then mortal draw
Probably not instant spawn, but still 2-cycle
how dumb is it btw that Hyrule Castle has 2 Green rupees
if he does the instant spawn cant you just do the wolf attack
or is the spawn not based on health
Instant spawn is when you deal an absurd amount of damage up front (assuming 2-cycle)
you getting tht domrod was a timesaver over waiting for a check to fill you up
so that digging around rly wasnt the worst sidetrack
huh goomeeDerp discord madge at me for tryin to send ya the sphere notes I had 🤣
silly stupid discord be like I guess
anyhow - the spheres of this seed were rather cozy once it fell into place so *shrug*
does pax have a couch in the back like gdq
wait who's super sonic i just sat back down
never met them but i might know of them through the grapevine
how long does this buff last come to think?
2d sonic runner named "supersonic" and then some numbers rings a bell
It goes away if you get hit
yeah we're in my time of night, no one's on really
this is why if i'm on late i tend to stay on until the aussies start to get on KEKW
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I got in here before he pinged lmao
anyways just here to put the tab up gotta shit then go to work
my memory's terrible with that stuff. I always remember right after I say it NotLikeThis
We've got... who pinned down raven?
I need a nap like crazy..
I legit completely forgot MySims existed until today
@AnniLyn2 "Who pinned down Raven?" Hmm
did you see the nintendo direct?
Japan gets a remaster of one of the most influential visual novels and US gets date a toilet the game
No @buff00n ...was asking who do we have pinned down because that's what came from the voice line thing
trials in the sky part 1 remake POGGIES
Apparently, Haunted Castle Revisited makes Haunted Castle worth a damn
Yeah I’m into the DQ games
they are NOT my type and I'm WAY too old for them
and tales of graces f miss playing it on ps3
Idk how old you guys are...lemme just make that known
All I can guess is Phan is like 27
Konami decided to get in on the 2D HD gravy train
are you rolling to see which seed you rolled? the rando-ception :P
I haven't played 'em in years, so I'm waiting to bite on Suikoden
my older brother's gonna freak. He loved 1 & 2
I'm interested in the new Mana game
Also who the hell asked for Balatro x Witcher III???
@Darkness3827 i played the demo and i was like this is shit and i love trial of mana
@blacktiger51 I need to play the demo, I've it downloaded, but I haven't booted it up yet
I need a good RPG to play. rn my only hope is modding Bravely Default II or FFV/VI Rando :/
Power Stone 2 with 4 players online is going to be very funny
I'd be estatic for Yakuza if I didn't already have 0 through 6 on PC
the game just feel really bad Sadge and i was hype for it
or modding rando into BDII lmao
I think I bought the Yakuza Collection for $30
I will never forgive Capcom for throwing Power Stone Collection on bloody PSP of all things
never had my interest in a title evaporate that quickly before or since
if it was a 1v1 cabinet, it was 1
1 is 1v1 only and 2 is 4 player free for all
So in pape...how can you tell which chapters you have to do?
I understand tp but here is different
you go to star summit and the stars you see correspond to the chapters you have to do
but yeah if haven't really memorized which one's which it's kinda difficult. Or don't know that's a thing like the first time I tried to do a blitz seed LUL
I mean I'm not planning on trying pape randos but curiosity got the best of me
Who knew cats can shed like huskies
I just noticed goombario start lmao
the fur in the trash takes form, another Chucky begins foaming the house
Oh geez, S3 has coin shuffle?
so are the coin bushes/trees not shuffled?
that's very odd to me lmao
my spring allergy sucks hard so I know how it feels
Havve you started the TP items only tracker or are you waiting for after Pax?
Ah, I see open partner upgrades are enabled too
I rolled a seed Im hopping is all dungeon but twilight lol
i've really been thinking about starting and not finishing another rando soon
a child held hostage by the fuzzy flag
I had to go to the dentist again today, deep clean the right side, then in a month I go back for the rest
so does prologue have the same scaling as chapter 1 or it's own random scaling?
how French vanilla of Bow to be near her home
so if a chapter is out of the pool will their areas be totally dead for key items
IIm glad we are getting Tales of Graces F re-released. Been wanting to revisit it but then Id have to dig out my PS3
well for the key items you need to complete the 4 chapters at least. It'll prolly have key items for the other dead chapters.
the areas are still accessible right? is it just filled with junk items
we need a new tales of game from bamco
i havent messed with these settings ever
time to make a youtube comment about how you should try 4 chapters no LCL :P
when are the single chapter sprints gonna start
more or less than 7 chapters, no keysanity? :P
i was watching your second seed from yesterday, wild how fast you went to GM
did you remember fice t check?
I can see the reason for including the extra Item Pouches too
how many are in the pool? 5?
i like it for allsanity but if youre only doing 4 chapters its just extra menuing
did rando get any cool updates lately?
Did Jesse's covid have any influence or has ist been primarily just alergies
Thats not how you spell that
does anyone know if i should watch any of the alien movies before i watch prometheus
but it's still in beta or some shit idk.
guess i have to watch 3 movies now Aware
spend 16 coins to get 1 coin
there should be an option to randomize what item Gourmet Guy will accept :P
does random have some crazy movement for that in glundo or no
there's only one real Jonathan here
Oh riiiiiiiight. That's the joke name they used in JP ain't it
yep that's his cool name in JP
that sounds like a you problem, Shadow.
I can't help it lolz I'm just normally exhausted
Yo have fun bullying general guy
Fine, have fun bullying the real supernova
I got sucked into SME hard
yay? I hope you get a break for your nose soon yea
honestly lucky I never had to deal with allergies much
oh not pollen but cat hair? oooof
all I know is I now collected nearly 40 shines or something and just now am I thinkin of going to bianco hills KEKW
and as for the alergies bit with the pollen - bets there's some but maybe you're just well enough accustomed to them existin
phantom can never touch grass SadPag
Those feel nice on my feet... if it isn't hot as hell
what do you expect that shit does when sun comes and says "hot"
tru but still like. they haven't invented plastic that doesn't melt at 150 degrees?
what gets used for plastic greenery is usually 2nd / 3rd grade shite
I renemberr sports classes on that shit
me sittin there, slidin across it, my entire skin burning from it
I'd rather have ash tracks then that shit tbh
at least ash easily washes out
This convo makes me want to get a slip n slide now lolz
about the one thing artificial greenery might be good at
except for the plastic crumbs you then have to kinda keep from getting washed anywhere where its not supposed to be
@annilyn2 hey how are you phanto274Wave
This month is just depressing for some reason
I wasn't paying attention lol did you dodge it???
I know I just woke up from a nap and saw you beat tubba but you left it there and I was so confused haha
Just your brain is automatically completing it as expected?
You got it locked and loaded basically
How's the practice seeds going? :)
this seed is boringly average based on your autopiloting lmao
cards are overrated. You don't need them
you could just put on FP plus lmao
Man these seeds seem to potentially be faster cause you get more opportunity to get the items you need with less travel
Idk man you look like you sleeping and gaming
Sorry Phan I had to lolz
If only it worked like that lolz
I forget about that one often
I honestly just split it when I come from left side
I'll do bottom half first, then top half after doing the town stuff
Her single slaps are funny to look at
@AnniLyn2 I call it her bitch slaps
See I WANTED to say bitch slaps lolz
I take it back...Phan is 28
It's always more than I expect
Oh cool long enough for me to shave and shower you'll be my noise
Look the beard is getting to my mouth eating
Later guys...HF Phan! Very expected phanto274GG evo17Hiyo
oh I have the diamond stone. I'm keeping it though :)
Been playing Stardew almost all day
After like a month in game
Modded the fuck outta my game
I did all this legit before
yeah Stardew is fun. I did like 1 playthrough tho and didn't really touch it again
I can't imagine someone getting mad at someone for using cheats in a single player game
@LunaAmethyst You cheated not only the game, but yourself :P
I did all of this legit before!
well assuming we're not talking bout like speedrunning cause you could argue that's still a single player game :P
but yeah casually it doesn't matter
I'm only doing it cuz it's my second file
I generally only use cheats in RPGs just to make games less grindy cause I don't got time for that shit.
but I play legit outside of that.
It's just saving time at that point
hugely appreciated bravely in that regard
cus you could turn up the exp gain by settings - and by quite a lot at that
Yeah it's literally called the cheat shop yeah
bravely literally has it in game settings
you could literally turn of / on / adjust exp, job exp and money drops
Love games that allow you to customize your experience
By end game you mean like end-end game, yeah that's fair
I generally get bored with Disgaea at around like lvl 500ish
I've heard 7 is much better
um excuse me mx strimmer, u forgor to mark a star that has no consequence on ur game tracking
4 is my fave. 5 is like the most fun to play but I really don't like it's story personally.
This category is just "Bowser got lazy"
"Yeah I'll just capture 4 of the Spirits, no big deal"
@LunaAmethyst it's majority vote, so if you get 4 on your side you can take control of the spirit council.
the other 3 weasled their way out of being captured and are just like lmao bruh weaksauce get it together losers at the other 4
a few minutes ago I became an uncle!!!
i was curious on your feelings for S3 so that was a good time to come in LUL
yeah i'm just not comfortable enough with panels i think, just not a big fan of the double dipping without super boots
is it crazy to like the 7 star seeds? idk why but i started liking those again
Goombario tattle for hints. Finally he'll be useful :P
yeah that's fair. oh absolutely, that's like... an hour saved LUL
I would then assume MM also works for ya
cus literally the same baseline as OoT has it
yeah i feel like OOT is the best example of how good hints can make a rando
technically a secondary hint location set in MMR, where the garo in Ikana can be incorporated as hint spots as well
oh I fucking hate the hints in ww races now lol
problem being that then your hints are gated by logic requirements to an extent (flows rather well in glitch logic)
Why do you think I stopped doing them LOL
routing for hints adds like a whole new part to the rando, i feel like that's fun
I only raced before hints in ww
The only other way to do hints would be like the fish from maps but that is so fucking slow lmao
Or just change letter check text to hints
the best I could see for windwaker past the lookers or whatever their name is is fish (way out of the way and not worth the time investment per single hint check not to mention bait bag locked)
If there's too many hints I dont have as much fun
I like the gambling and risk reward of rando
problem with the mail boxes I think is the fact that they internally all handle the same code and are just instances of the same overall actor if that makes sense
it's crazy how gossip stones lends itself to be hint stones too. like it's just in the game already lol
problem what I am tryin to get at is the fact that you got loads of mail related checks as well
which kinda ned those boxes to work like they currently do, so you'd have to add without hurting that
and I dunno if there's someone in the WWR dev team who'd like to fuck with that
the king of red lions is as dumb as the fish were before that
info dumb v 1minute avg time investment per single item hint
not including resource gathering and wasting
I think what WWR could do is use the stone text signs
like at that point why not just give people a hint dump before you boot up the game so they can just start playing instantly
becuse there is a couple of those
randos that are more about routing/logic vs execution i feel like always make races more exciting
pair that with the guys which have the telescopes (and which are giving out hints afaik)
and wooden signs which afaik also do exist
just each set on their own not enough to give a good option on their own
you'd have to use them all for a good range
and then obviously kinda find a way to lump the isles together so that you dont have loads of single check isles as foolish in low checktotal seeds and shit
cus that I think was the biggest hurdle for a WotH/Fool hint system which in turn initially had led to the fish being your only source of item specific only hints
cus you got 49 quadrants of in between 1 to maybe 5 checks average, outliers being outset or windfall which have LOADS to do compared cus they're the "hub" isles of the story
and going by check type (so say, big octos or lookout free chests, lookout combat chests, as like "check type region" so to speak)
i kinda wish ispy was on in these settings too, but i'm probably alone on that
kinda is also rough to get good calls on yay / nay
especially given you having maybe ONE item on one lookout free chest and then none of them are hinted foolish as an example
just reminds me of the same thought of always seeing invisible blocks being on now too
so you HAVE to come up with a system to somewhat evenly across check pool divide the quadrants
yeah considering they're potentially required I think you prolly should get I Spy just in case people don't know where all the panels are.
lmao if you happened to get all the key items for a non LCL dungeon could you just do that instead? Or does it need to be the 4 on SSS?
Cause I think you're just missing red key for chapter 7 LUL
with partner shuffle it's finally time for a potential kooper meta yoshiGasm
would be sick if they could put a little letter on it
since Bow and Bombette both begin with B :P
too bad you don't have Watt tho
since this isn’t a race quake hammer was in ch5 shop
oh right I’m way behind after I left internet… let me catch up
I see gamestop is trying to get back into retro games again. They crazy if they think people will trade in retro games KEKW
"heres 20 bucks for your dreamcast version of marvel vs capcom 2" LUL
the nice thing though is you have ultra stone HahaThink
you were 1 damage off lethal yeah
there was a mushroom in the chest before super
Doesn't electric shroom completely block babies?
Saw one of those in the shop
there was an upgrade in the shop too tho
1 FP Megabomb pls and thx
time to dip chapter 4 for upgrades? LUL
i heard there's a sushi upgrade between Kolorado and the wall 👀
harder than vanilla Lava Piranha yay!
lmao you could do chapter 7 now!
hey maybe UR Bombette is good!?
I feel like if partners are out of LCL then their upgrades should also be out of LCL tbh.
I enjoy partner upgrade shuffle a lot in 7 star, but yeah in 4 star it seems like you don't get anywhere near enough upgrades.
to be fair what will likely happen is people will see the issue with partner upgrade and then not want to do it next season
I hate that block so much lmao
well the dayzee gauntlet leading to it at least
dip chapter 4 for Watt :P
don’t know why but I think you almost dead
shell shot costing 1 fp is good
Good damage for 1 FP? SATISFACTION
yo hi Phantom hows pape treating you today
the previous one was easy. the first one was boring
should i bring the seed to the basement to teach it some things
2 fp outta sight isn't terrible, but yeah literally every other partner skill is lmao.
what if a mandatory item is in one of them
so I may not see watt this play through
what were the issues with S2 btw?
I wonder how it would feel if the AP implementation of LCL was back-ported since that behaves a bit differently...
and Watt is ultra ranked but prolly out of LCL
Progression in non-required chapters is vanilla, and from when I played, it seemed like all the partner upgrades were still in the pool
So I had almost every partner at Ultra-rank by the end
Tubba Blubba's hurt animation in that battle lives in my head rent free, I love that sprite
I have died of heat exhaustion already
Ice didn’t tell me they live in a fucking oven
Is star storm your best aoe option now?
I have a guess and I'm just coming back
Is it the one check that requires ultra hammer in the sewers that isn't winding path?
having to do that should be illegal i think
yo we clearin chapter 7 now? lmao
oh right lol, pretty sure we saw that and just forgot
told ya to dip chapter 4 for watt!!! :P
see, the pro strat is to just dip chapter 4 for power stuff
even if it's out of LCL :P
Yikes, yeah I think this might actually be a small point for AP
cause there's so many goddamn checks
I think I'm gonna go sleep now. Have fun with last seed. Hopefully chapter 4 will be in logic.
seems like the best seeds have chapter 4 required
would making partner costs cheaper help mitigate the randomness of upgrades?
is fully random lower on average than semi-random?
The only way to control the partner costs is to make them vanilla
The 2 partners you were missing last seed immediately lol
immediately replacing goombario with best child
and of course the one time you don't get her shes ultra ranked :(
aka two of the better chapters under this flagset
Yeah there was a reason Ultra Stone start was a thing for Blitz and this makes it worse
We have seen a Fortress Key too
whelp we saved by the massive checks of 4 and 5
This is the only chapter combo that allows no Super Boots
Yo, Phantom. Practice seed hype! KomodoHype
I’m just hoping the settings don’t suck for people. if they’re gonna suck I’d at least like to commiserate with everyone!
Welp, so much for no boots
Well, there's your hammer in a panel...
yeah cake mix and power plus
What settings did you end up voting for? Sorry if this question has already been asked
You specifically, I know we're running 2
pouches are such a nice add on to the randos.
I see, I totally understand. Yeah the 7 star spirit dungeon shuffle is a hard sell
Sucks that Blitz makes so many other things harder and pairs poorly with some settings
how would folks feel if all partner upgrades were all in progressive locations (not in the other 3 chapters)
I wonder how difficult it would be to implement path hints
And maybe the important NPCs could tell you the hints
I feel like overall you summed up my feel with most blitz settings tippiThink
not saying that this rn is a blitz type setting obviously
cus I dont know what the specifics of this are rn
100% I was one of those people, sometimes I felt super undertooled for the fight.
Agree with the hints for 7 chapters, need to be a way for them to be shorter imo
Oooooh how did you implement hints?
Ahh, so you can’t use a bulletin board to place a hint
Some kind of system would be nice though, no matter how they implement it
heck put new signs at the start or chapters
Cause that’s how TP does the hints right? it uses the signs?
shocker, that sounds like most of the lake hylia hints in OoT which no one loves to read KEKW
yeah 4 is just way too good
I mean it’s what, 15 total checks in that room
I wasn’t a huge fain of coinsanity as an option so I’m curious what people’s thoughts will be
And indirectly bombette via Sushie in 4
Wouldn't surprise me if 2 and 4 have similar numbers of total checks but 4 is so dense and so not out of the way that it's probably worth diving Blue Station ASAP even when it's out of logic
Unless your combat is just already amazing
leaving 5 with nearly every partner
Green spike tops look really good.
💀 the singular shy guy is so funny
We opened the tomb to take back the star spirit. LUL
Been watching your randomizer runs, had to drop a follow
i was getting a drink didn't know they starting early KEKW
could this perchance be THE run
Iza was hinted? i missed that
oh? has the update been pushed to github?
I take it I need to remove the pack I have to download from emotracker?
awesome and thanks! I prefer in this scenario to get from github just so I dont have to worry about my overrides
oh right! with items only I dont need to mark like bugs and open dungeons anymore
what do you think of doing owl statue chest first then jumping down for the grotto?
you cant be go mode till you find validation rupee
but the ruppees go to charity
which means you can write it off KEKW
or its a fake out domrod
So need to find the other dommy Roddy Mommy
Engage the wild goose chase for buggies
this'll be a fun seed I'm sure
nice, you found the deku stick
when did link learn Goku's instant transmission?
Get a hint for bombs to Ball and chain, get the item right after
Goku isn't the only one with Instant Transmission anymore, Vegeta has it too but only used it once and no more out of pride
Haven't seen the forest temple in a bit
Yes, Moro Arc in the Dragon Ball Super Manga
Hey uh phan... have you already been to city?
I'm a bit confused on how to lja in city in the beginning
I got to the first platform... problem is the second side
Today I finished a manga thats getting an anime adaption in October. The mother dies and 10 years later her memories return to a random child. Great stuff
So the hint for the Dommy Roddy may be for the first one
The title doesnt translate well into english so hoping they leave that in japanese lol
oh right next week starts SUBtember
Tried to watch yesterdays stream but got ads Sadge reminded me to resub though
Man is that a pink tunic blue hood link
he got that shit on though
Any guesses on what it is
And it's probably this bug that's spinner
but how else will you get great spin?!
what do you think of shuffling dungeon rewards?
I was trying to find a way to gen all the dungeons but exclude twilight
if we could start with a mirror shard that would handle it
How do you generate all dungeons? I just came back
I figured it had to be that
btw boots isnt marked again LUL
No need to spend 500 now
i thought for use you were gonna do helmosaur grotto lol
i wish the 6 bugs were on the left side of the screen
I do know before it was based on their spherre location
then they removed bug locations from the pool
Okay... I'll take a learning session with city another day...I dont feel good at all
clicked on pope and instant panic button
phanto274GL Phan... very expected phanto274GG phanto274GG phanto274BLANKIES
I ate too much and kinda feel like napping, but i got 9 hours of sleep last night so prob not the best idea
is pax gonna have fast spinner to show it off?
i do agree with this before city
you use said lake was dead Kappa
And now just a banana and a sword
I have returned with spaghetti peepoCozy
right, sphere 1 cause you need to knock down the spiders
i could see a sword being in snowpeak
was just thinking about how funny it would be if Link clipping thru that fence was in manga lol
My female ant for your sword
Makes me think boomerang can be vanilla
yeah this room is the worst
when are we getting fast whatever tf these things are called in rando? :(
Which have been in a few zeldas
they should move at like 3x speed
mm has a grand total of 1 peahat
these fans are also the worst
So this place held a sword got it
So peahats aren't in Phantom Hourglass or Spirit tracks
Bless windwaker molgera for being hit based so I never have to experience shit like this LOL
my ass would do extra cycle skips if I had to though
you killed a dragon living in the heavens above! have five bucks
Barren but for an indirect sword
if only it was 5 real dollars lol
Fully expecting boomerang within Forest temple
And the only reasons why the dungeons aren't barren this seed
Will this be your only seed?
church teaching you how to commit murder
The church thar preaches love via DEATH
me when the church teaches you the mortal draw
This now confirms forest is likely the boomerang
Yeah... have fun with him lolz
Also painful that the boomerang is go mode
What if rang is in mountain rather than ruins..
How did something huge as a peahat in oot and mm became a fucking plant that sounds like a trumpet in ww
I think they wanted to feature them without them taking lots of space
I kinda like how they look in wind waker
peahats dont even do anything in TP and ss, they're just moving clawshot posts
That shit in ss is also a peahat?
They really downgraded them a fuck ton
yeah they used pehats in the same way they used them in tp
use the gifts of the church templars
i know its crazy, but what if boomerang isn't here
maybe thats the randos plan all along
Well I played through the seed I was thinking but it was too fast. Will find another one
I see this was a long one
??? Wow that is kinda weird
Ain't no way the second seed is going to be worse
Yeah you're doing the Pax thing soon
Does this one have a spoiler log available?
Yeah that is why I mentioned the thing about hint signs. Was the KG sign
Blame Malo for making the seed longer
The double I need this stuff
Hopefully second verse better than the first hi again YouTube phanto274GL
20 bucks? dang i was hoping that check would be a peanut
you're fast, can't believe you already found 18 poes in 5 minutes
I mean yeah, where else would they be?
I should make a new seed for tomorrow..
I call a sword in lakebed
Was it Faron Field or Faron Woods that was dead..
still absolutely silly they made dom rod into a weapon in hyrule warriors
i also love using the spinner to just skate over hordes of foes lmao
How'd everything looking? I went to get popcorn
Perfect... could find big key and get it over with yeah?
Oh you don't have rang... can't do poe skip
Goes to show we can screw up once and still get it done
Imagine if the double claw chest had iron boots
but it's satisfying when you do it good
Oh no I love the star game
reading the seed well is rewarding
does swinging make it go any faster or is that just a boredom thing?
just got kaka alcove chest 3 times consectively
surprised how much the L target matters
also I copied the wrong setting string
flight by fowl gave a twilight boss key LUL
You managed to get all dungeons no twilight?
not really, if there was a way to start with a mirros shard you could prob mark the whole thing out of logic then
prob wouldnt be a bad idea to do south castle before lake since it takes you there
i assume Hidden Village is always barren with race settings
Oh so THAT'S how you do it!
I forgot you had to beat temple of time to get to it.
i skip ordon and sword was clawshot and goats was lantern phanto274S
well at least for you since lantern was in ordon you didn't have to go back for the other checks lol but yeah that's rough
I should mess around with yugioh AP to see if thats what I wanna run for the month
lucky for me 2006 is my favorite one on GBA
my problem is none of the games ik really well are on AP :(
Skybook s not good if city is not required
Seeds like that make you want to sometimes just refuse to enter a dungeon until you are go-mode lol
Have you seen the video of Link punching the eyeball lol
It was a sword in the last seed
Today wasn't your day it seems... at least it was at home and not at pax right?
2 minute wait for an orange rupie
How much time would have been saved by just go moding the dungeons after the bks
Star having dommy rods on both seeds
I guess the Star guy was waiting for Zelda to come in for her dommy rods on both
Okay I think I have locked the seed in
do you think he has a desire
oh hey you said my name
yeah if you give me the seed i'll just load it on my mem card and have it with me in case of disaster formatting or something
y'know if you throw boomerang at him you force a chance time
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
the problem of being on twitch at this time it's 4am so i never know which timezone some refer to
lopez is green in flower fields
he be maxing spooks now have you seen his shit
oh wait it's wednesday already I thought it was like tuesday
I was like why tf they gone so long
good luck learning the new stuff we "totally" dont know about
yesterday I did a fun TP seed, all dungeeons and key sanity, but I started with all hyrule keys. Finished over 9 hours lol
I've just started following you on Twitter, and I'm hopeful you'll follow me back <3
I did say isaac would find the worst seed possible
lol at racetime "is that THE pax phantom" LUL
no respect for Pax Glubbers? :(
are you pinning the always and sometime hints?
but I've been talking to glubber the whole time lmao
afk for a bit, feeding pupper befor eyou start
I never played octopath but I played Bravely Default II which is the same peeps and that has an absolutely gorgeous soundtrack
also I think I made a mistake playing all the quals in a row too early
cuz I've improved vastly between my 5th qual and this one
I say perish and they magically vanish
with a snap of my fingers, a more greatful twitch
yeah this qual is significantly smaller surprisingly
i wonder if its the time start
is there a yt vod of it yet
You could just make the command the run
Tabbing out of popes stream is a mistake I can no longer anticipate what's coming
points are based on top 3 yeah?
I would expect you pigeon and skystorm to be top 3
glubber and fodder aren't bad though so maybe they pop off
pupper is fed and I am ready now
Icola is pretty volatile based on watching him
korambu kinda just rushes stuff yeah?
yeah i didn't wanna deal with fire temple so i figured id just come here lmao
yeah i cant take those kind of risks god will make an example out of me
tektite grotto is EVIL and sHOULD BE SHUNNED
I think not doing tektike is ok
cuz it makes south more appealing later
I just do it cuz eh
yeah thats all i do, i check charo on my way to sign
heasd to jovani, loop back to aggie, then head out
I want to hit up Trusty someday
The artist I'm getting my current thing from doesnt animate so I got no one to help u there
oh dang if i knew there was this few entrants idve joined- but also not bcuz its 9 pm
and i have to work tomorrow
werent they also the last person to ready last time you did a quali? lmao
i see a lack of notable big names- i could've done well here too RIP too late now
ill have to watch that during my shift tomorrow
@nixnjix I've ran windwaker for 4 years LUL
if he doesnt have a score he must've DNF
Windwaker is a treat. I forgot they were doing something for a rando
HD rando is a lot of fun
I dont actively do attempts in speedrun categories anymore but I do love playing hd rando still
UZA at least means no Iza\
Anyone want to make a guess on which item will put in go mode?
bnc isnt required for go mode
imagine hidden skill is go mode KEKW
Hidden skill go mode would be amazing when there's a literal list of items needed for go
okay im gonna call it now, fishing rod is go mode
SPR barren and go mode coral earing lmao
good thing that wall was there lol
I definitely think this would have to be the worst set of dungeons given for a race seed
this was the same as the PAX seed
ooh it's the reverse of last time
Like this is a good set of dungeons for a marathon and pretty bad for a race because it has the potential to be loooong
whats the GDQ venue like at PAX? obviously its much smaller
I love not being able to see :D
it bet its so nice to be able to see the game again LUL
Tell that to the ALTTP runners
Who have the skill to navigate in the dark
my monitor is as bright as the sun so io can always see the game Well in the caves
Also they just updated Hyrule Historia to basically place Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom as their own branch
I mean it makes sense cause it doesn't fit anywhere LOL
Which makes sense given that the lore behind BotW and TotK don't really match with the rest of the timeline
botw has lore? who knew KEKW
Echoes of Wisdom does definitely fit in the main timeline however
We finally donate to the old fool
I remember the old fool did have a spinner once
donate to the church to be able to commit terrorism D:
And church of the mortal draw
you should go back to playing with light traps again LUL
battle network corners strike again LUL
i couldnt get that to save my life yesterday then got it first try today
Did he also turn chat off?
Hope ur summer was great and awesome!
Blue and red are such a nice touch
when marking pinned check with the items they have I noticed keys arent an option. Is that something simple for me to add?
ill just mark it with a poe then KEKW
yooo GG on your run at GDQ 2 days ago
you didn't post in daphe discord :O
I hope you are doing good
i'm locked behind howling stones...some i can't get to
i forgot to turn them off...gimme a break lol
i've had a seed where hints fucked me over
actually i think i complained about it in discord xD
No worries I got bamboozled by the desert placement as well.
hey I just came from a really shitty race seed!
I think I realize why I mess that up... trouble with timing in city
chapters 1237, first chapter being completable 1:15 in with lunar stone in pit
"Kakariko village barren" *bug has clawshot and have city*
who knew Lantern would be bane of our existence,
i ahte this room so much
The wing flap is funny to look at
My phone decided to force restart for an update
yo Phantom, gl with race and great job at Pax over the weekend!
I guessed that based on the last minute here lol Sadge
Which turned out to be crap
that is why oot and mm hints are goated. regardless if u activate pranks foolish
I hate when this happens, keep thinking it’s gotta be this and keep remembering checks worse and worse FeelsBadMan
Oh I hope so hard it is the first chest
im gonna get some sleep, night guys
so long axl a nice refreshing username
Oh rain told me to ask... does emotracker have like a save thing?
I think the overlapped hints basically screwed you over
So dumb...waste of something that could've been useful as a hint
One point maybe do a seed and not take hints...see how it plays out?
Hii Phantom! How was your trip? phanto274Smile
How does the point system work?
i'm glad you had a great time!
I'm gonna look for a Dorito now
I would say second worse... you had a qualifier race that pissed you off so bad you dnf and stopped playing for the night
Hint to a key when keysanity off seems really dumb
Seems like an oversight to me
Ff path to blizzeta. Iron boots to lantern to ball. But having an overlapped hint was just horrible and confusing
bye all enjoy ur Pax break.
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
Can't wait for Echoes of Wisdom in a few weeks
Tournament qualifier race, no advice, etc.
@blacktiger51 Can never first again :P
@Darkness3827 nope not redeeming it anymore
Tournament qualifier race, no advice, etc.
howdy hey, good luck on the race phantom!
Yes a bonus stream during the break!
yeah no restream today so i'll probably be hanging out here
How many goddamn cameras do you need? :P
How long til phones are just all cameras
nice i prob need a new phone my is like 5 years old KEKW
Yeah I find participation falls off at the end because people binge at the beginning
I would enter this one if i could
lets see if you get sniped again
yeah i've more or less dropped out lmao
Or more, if you beat them
nah the real meta is do really well onyour 5 races, then just do dogshit to boost everyone else
pretty sure you were at 16?
ive done 2 but my secopnd time is... so bad
but i just dont have it in me to do another race
Is it just your top 2 times that count?
your top 2 of your first 5
Okay. When I did a ZSR rando tourney it was more convoluted than that
well this is the first tourny
like 7 max, top and bottom 2 dropped so it was like scores 2-5
top 3 seems a bit better cause it's less about spiking 2 runs. Or droping the top and using the next 2 yeah.
Minish cap credits goes hard for tournament pre game
Yeah 5 attempts to get 2 good runs probably means most people play super risky
yeah just not going to a region ever saves a lot of time if you don't actually need to go there.
*blows up city in the sky*
Sure but you get snowpeek Kappa
okay now it's city formerly in the sky
I'm not familiar with tp rando, what key items are needed to complete the rando?
Oh interesting is the Hyrule castle barrier already down?
wait what's the other check for one fishing rod?
hmmmm yeah ok im convinved ill join the race
totally forgot bout that one lol.
you still gotta name it peaches tho im counting on you
Millions of peaches, peaches for me. Millions of peaches, peaches for free.
im kidding nah ill join why not
Forgot there was a slingshot in tp lol
see you on the otherr side, if I dont make it ill be watching lol
excuse me strimmer this is the wrong zelda game
Is there any other kind of deku toad
when did they put the mushroom kingdom into twilight princess
peaches? calm down jack black bowser
for whatever reason you can't predict losers bracket with the bracket prediction stuff unless they changed that.
You can turn on losers bracket predictions
holy shit i am almost at 750k points
i... i don't think he is random voice clip
i would of still got 69 if 1st was 10k
10000 x 69 is 690000 i would of been broke after
yeah I think the 2nd live one you did was like 33 peeps
i ordered snes usb controllers today will be here on sunday gonna be nice for snes and gba games
Name epona Cream? For Peaches and Cream lolz
gonna be really nice for fire red ap
ye just wishing luck then going silent
Never heard of it, lemme know what you think
i will i heard there are good
hmm the person who was last to ready up last time isn't ready and isn't live either NotLikeThis
Know what I mean? Peaches and Cream lolz
i been using a controller that looks like a xbox 360 controller
gonna be real i was expecting a third orange rupee there
funny moment where the rewards got better the easier it was to land on the platforms
ohey i guess that X8 16-bit demake is done, the 1.0 version is at SAGE
ooh I just noticed you changed the blue
wow you didn't get sniped for once
well that was unfortunate. 10 minutes into race something urgent came up costimg me 15 minutes phanto274Smile
i always wondered if this implies that this entire complex was in OoT also, we just never went into it
what have we seen? or ignore this if itll cause issues
i love that you just instantly surface lol
Yeah I guess were not getting klaws today
Waiting for build on a Friday...maybe it's time to call it early.
nice first hr but alas gotta head to hospital GL with rest
well your instinct was right about forest temple
link did you... did you fire yourself out of your bow
you wanna have my shit luck phantom?
also hope the seed is going well
FIRST dayzee encounter in ch4 of ttyd I get a amazy
and now I am tryin to figure out how to frickin dunk on that thing KEKW
I would guess you dont know if clock out works on amazy's right?
thanks still for the answer tippiFlower
There are 4 clawshot checks in the desert??
I was practicing the ljas...I could go to the chest but can't leave :/
I wonder if you can do that trick in vanilla tp
wow good to know that beating a darknut in hyrule warriors is as easy as it si in TP
just hit them once then loop around and annihilate :P
smh my head can't believe you read the log to see it was there
love how link's like "wait a minute i victory posed too soon
hows the ladder stuff set up for this?
gotcha, but you're allowed to play more for those score evals
cus "Just 2 seeds" sounds superbly rough otherwise
I GOT THAT ONE LAST TIME
so its kinda same to say how (this is me hearing but not 100% knowing) about how MMR bracket stuff is set up where you can I THINK? play up to 7, and you got your 4 bests of that which make up your avg score there
faron field is the one by ordon right
just was curious given you mentioned scoring and stuff, which somehow ppl need to come up with some metric for this to create your vs board after quals and such
its the one north of faron woods
vanilla its the in between after forest temple towards eldin region
or if you recall the ilia cart defense, the field where casually EVERYONE had the cart go in circles at least once at somepoint KEKW
just to clarify given you are go mode, but the room is still active, we arent allowed to give our 5 cents? tippiTap
PrideLaugh lets just say I got some Zelda Rando brain cents which seemingly make a triumphant return here
as in overall rando, given I did play WWR, MMR, OoTR respectively for funs and such
ggs, you're out of the seed! tippiTap
Do you want to know why people finished so fast?
South of Castle Town wolf jump
hey - its better then it havin been related to just sphere 0 stuff
which given you're finished now, my 5 cents to potential weird routing by people => hunting sphere 0's longer
in MMR, you could call a similar reference with most standard race settings on "overworld camping" given dungeons are so super dense on logic requirements
I view Faron Field as a mini flight-by-fowl
I haven't timed it, but I don't think it is that far from the FW portal
and more often then not without adding in checks from inside the dungeon or loosening up the logic reqs in those / to those, you end up with them having nothing
yep - and you cant even say its a bad play to just clear a dungeon out for items when you (player = you) are not in go mode yet
just a "dice rolls of rando seed gen decided yes / no on whether its good"
like with hunting down sphere 0's - you can get stuff from it, but you can also get nothing from it
There is Challenge Cup if you get pushed out
@Feli_Heli 1 day we will get a real ttyd rando
ppl were pokin at that feli tippiTap
just its not been far past a "poking it with rel loader" phase so far
another thing I would keep in mind with TTYD rando is you need some BIG QoL to declutter some of the big chase chapters
the ch7 start also is a long one for ttyd on that end
i have TacoBell on the way
right I member that one PrideLaugh
always good to have a brain cleanser if a rando seed was sucky tippiGiggle
How did peaches do today LMAO
I've been meaning to try PMR.
i also think i did very well, i got a new PB
I got dom rod before going into TOT
i got it right after getting rang in Stockave
ah, dom rod was go mode for me
bcuz my hints and pathing kinda all worked out for me
bcuz memo to TOT> i got dcs there, got spinner, then rang, then domrod, then went and cleared all 3 temples
i absolutley CHOKED on ganon tho i am so mad about it
yeah, bcuz i checked eldin really late, so i did stockcavce, got rang, decided to do stalfos and then got rod, and went back into FT
i dont think youre gonna fall out of top 24?
i only know that beest was joining too i think
ngl this is kinda the reason i dont wanna do rando race lol you can play well but if you just dont find the things then rip
the first rule of asyns is we dont talk about asyncs
we aren't allowedto talk about it intil the 8th
yeah I figured I was just wondering if you'd get extra points from that.
ok no im dumb, domrod was DCS in SCT
i dont remember what was in stalfos grotto
I feel like taking out grottos would reduce a lot of that. Cause they're often in the middle of nowhere lol.
Yeah Grottoes do tend to add a lot of variance in whatever Zeldas have them for rando
I mean you have the underwater goron check still :P
yeah there was alot of shenanigans with setting up the rules
yeah alot of people thought having bugs was too OP for sphere 1
at least 5…. come on kids! jcnoli11Toad
having 4 as out of chapter rotation will hurt a lot
but yeah shaved off like 28 minutes from my PB?? thats very exciting for me
Super Watt, partner problem is solved
yeah it's gotta be 7 or at least 6 I presume
yeah i just took some risks with my pathing and also just got lucky with checks, but idve been like 10 minutes less if i didnt have dolphin disconnecting my controller TWICE and also choking on ganon
I am finally out of creeple steeple PrideLaugh
time to do shenanigans so I can ultra rank bobbery early tippiGiggle
you know what I am thinkin about or nah?
Shoulda done chapter 5 last and just up & away'd him :P
yea thats what I am thinkin about doin - did it once, suuuper fun
AND I can also use tht to open up the path to ch6 return pipe early given I dont go through certain loadzones and mess shit up sideways
it’s apparently my two month suberversary, so I thought I’d gift some!
Fall asleep to tp and wake up to pape
The worst you could've done? But the timing was good... what did you place? Like 3rd?
Technically worked my first 9-5 today
yeah i joined today on a last minute impulse
like im glad i did bcuz i did a really good PB- but also like damn its wildly inconsistent
im curious to read pigeons comment
or maybe they realized that the qualifier was null for them anyways
well the last person is in the ganon fight so its a matter of time before we can see
lmao pigeons comment is "missed a mega jet lol"
lmao skinnydee "we should get rid of phase 3 ganon" lmao horse phase screws us all
i keep choking more on pig phase recently, which is upsetting
like i already ex[pect horse phase to suck- but the chokes ive been having on pig phase recently are wild
i get the hit, but i am never able to get to him in time to actualy HIT HIM when hes down
yeah i think i choked on like 2 hits on his stomach and failed a few charges and got barreled over
So he's doing good staying there to open the way
The most useful that Goombario has ever done
im curious to see the rankings
you say as issac immedialtley puts them out
well it still top best, and for the rest of us those wont matter
im assuming you alreayd did your 5?
yeah same im like 90% sure today was my fifth
because i think i did 4 live and 1 async
for this paper mario league? i assume youre not referring to TP
oh yeah but what if I get really cracked
you have a top 10 ten time?
I dont even know how to play this game
but yeha im sitting at 39- theres no way i make it into brackets here
but we can do the brazil league lmao
me n phantom if phantom gets knmocked out of brackets tomorrow
there is a CHANCE everyone does really badly tomorrow
its because of how the scores are calculated
i mean tbf the top 24 has like 10 speed runners
though I was referring to MMR
OoTR side I dont know if they did that like that
that seems a lot more fair
Yeah I think I was around to watching that Season matches
well I probably wont qualify either
4 which matter for MMR last I recall unless its changed
I mean even if it was 5 qualifiers drop the best and worst I think that'd be fine
what is score based on? is there more to it than time?
the sad thing is I've improved vastly since my 5 quals
teejay if you check the TPR tourney rules doc it shows what the scores are calculated on
so its not even reflective of those scores
i woulda joined todays qual but I over slept like hell lol
so say, 10 people play a seed, 1 person beats it in like 120minutes, gets the highest score of that match, anyone finishing after gets less (by some percentage which is decided by who made that scoring system for the respective qual stuff)
@Jonxhas interesting. so for each seed it's a comparison rather than something like median time across seeds.
like - I dont know if TPR would take like 10% or some such from 1st to 2nd and then gradually further down in similar decrements, but some odd numbers like tha is what I heard MMR racing side handles itself like
its actually very interesting that the top score for this qual is the lowest top score of all the other Quals
I dont think its very fair personally
there is the equaltion used for the scores in the rules document
@nozomup thats why you have more then 1 seed matter usually
cuz its not judging you as a runner it judges you based on how worse you are than the best player lol
so that its not a "swing of the day" / "not your seed" scoring
@nozomup that kinda makes sense insofar as it tries to normalize for "good" vs "bad" seeds
5 seeds is still not a good idea of how good you are
it might be that 2 was chosen not anticipating a high player count this time around? tippiShrug
its scored per seed, then the top two scores of the first 5 seeds you did
yeah we had no idea what the turnout would be for this tourny
as we had very few poeple showing up to the blossom races before turny annoiuncment
they did not do a good job talking about s1 coming up
and then it just kinda blewup since gym and beast and other big runners joined
so of course no one was showing up
beest and gym help with that but they also focus on other stuff so its not surprising they dont turn up
i mean everything was openly discussed in the race channels since blossom races started
you'd only know if you're there
thats not a good job talking about it
keeping it localized in your own community doesn't tell others about it
well yeah, we weren't expecting a huge outcome to becin with
you cant think that when you don't even talk about it to outside communities though
me n issac were talking about it and at first we thought we wouldn't even had 24 people
i was trying to think of something sassy but just went with a hi
tpr has been anticipated for awhile for its season 1
just no one knew it was even gonna happen
good to hear though that you got more people interested into TPRando then you initially thought for this type of stuff
cus that also spreads the brainworm of rando with TP PrideLaugh
ph yeah its not terrible that so many people showed up- but having the context that we weren't expecting this much of a turnout can explain for how the ruleset is
now that you've had more pape seeds with these settings, have your thoughts changed on them at all?
yeah i tried it and i just don't and have never enjoyed panels. i don't mind not playing lol
people are gonna lose because of panels 100%
i totally forgot about the ap KEKW
i think you calling the seeds volatile feels accurate
ive never played paper mario and only barely pay attention when i see you and Axl running it- so i have no idea what any of this means
Also coinsanity makes chapter 4 have a billion checks which kinda sucks if it's not in logic. Like the seed Phantom had with Ultra rank Watt but no Watt cause it was in chapter 4 and relying on not upgraded Laki cause both upgrades were also in chapter 4 (or was it Para I forget but still the point stands)
@PeachedPocky This is me with TP :)
i have been playing through the zelda games yeah
play through each of the first three pape games they're all great :D
or should i say i have beat tp but haven't played it since 07 so idk what going on KEKW
tbh only reason i joined qual today was bcuz i had free time today- bcuz no restream (i was up for commentating) and my friend was like "keep playing OOT" and i really.... didn't want to do that
I love SPM but it's very different from 64/TTYD
yeah im mid fire temple rn
sorry for the bad take- i do not care for oot. Im not having the best time
I'd say dont play it if you dont enjoy it
its not gonna be for everyone
its my first playthrough and im holding the same opinion as i did with WW.
I do gotta finish it tho
I mean im a oot addict
yeah I'm not a fan of MM or WW personally, each person is gonna have their own tastes.
i have played way too much oot KEKW
i think i have like 2000 hours in oot it's an awful game lol
tbh when people say OOT was the BESAT ZELDA EVER MADE i view that as the same way i view diamond and pearl as the best pokemon games- they arent./ its just nostalgia
and if you don't like it its ok
wait, it's possible to let other people not like things?
impossible you have to like what I like or else
I must go reevaluate my life.
@TeeJayOhNine isnt that crazy, being in a safe an accepting part of the internet
@RvPA yeah i have a little less then that KEKWait
I think I have about the same amount of hours as you Rv
@PeachedPocky idk most people I talk to about Pokemon say B2/W2 are the best
oh yeah and the remakes were just awful
been playing ootr for like 4 years bruh
gen 4 made me quit pokemon lol
Brilliant Diamond was my first Pokemon game YEP
I just recently started doing tpr so I dont play it as much now
BDSP i was so excited for bcuz sinnoh remakes and they botched it so hard
@MarioManTAW Oh god I am so sorry.
Pokemon gen discourse is new to me. I haven't heard many claims about which are the best
Diamond and pearl are goated! They are NOT the best pokemon games lmao
I'm a big fan of gen 1 and 2
It's fucking terrible, but it's going lmao
Gale/Colo are the best pokemon games I will hear no counter argument.
i think emerald is one of the best
gen 1 is not the best either
i played way too much yellow as a kid
idk why so many people think gen 1 is the best
I never played gen 3 but naturally have a lot of nostalgia for 1 and especially 2
I think gen 1 is fun but like man the mechanics
Emerald is my fave mainline game. Gale is my fave pokemon game period. BRT is my fave spinoff game.
i feel like i baaarely missed out on more pokemon as a kid
like my top 3 are emerald, XY, and SWSH in regards to replayability for me
Kanto is a good region, gen 1 is poorly programmed
like gen 1 was popular when i was in elementary school then it just kinda wasn't, it's like we all lost interest
my top 3 pokemon are pearl, xd gale of darkness, and pokemon stadium
i had a lot of fun with fire red rando when i try it
i just really enjoyed the story and the open world of it
The only game I ever played comp was ORAS LUL
tbh i think every other pokemon gen is a miss
It made it more fun to make strats imo
like you have a great one then the next one SUCKS
The Stat boosts for me are better than tera
IM LOOKING AT YOU SCARLET AND VIOLET
the only thing I dont like about sword and shield is their wild area is tacked on
oh yeah but i never cared about pokemon for *graphics*
they were made to be like 8 pixels big ffs
sure but the wild area looks like a n64 game and runs like one
I'd feel the same way about it, if you dynamax you actually go for the boosts rather than the health boost lol
every other part of the game is great
but then you do that and thats the "big feature" they promoted
still haven't played sword shield or scarlet and violet to this day will i play them nope KEKW
oh yeah youre not wrong- didn't care for the wild area, the concept was there- but then they took it into scarlet and violet and make it so much worse
It's more sane than Tera imo
scarlet and violet is just the wild area
Because Tera made the game worse
I did like scarlet and violet though
More than bad it's very fucking toxic
i loved the story of scarlet and violet- but the rushed development and the gameplay just ruined it and made it so awful
i heard tera and thought we were talking smite for a sec 👀
Yeah I played Gen 1-4 then quit, then came back for ORAS & SM and then saw Ultra SM and was like nope I'm quitting again screw pokemon.
like as soon as i beat it- didnt do any post game- i just uninstalled it and havent touched it since
Everyone talking about casuals and we're talking vgc KEKW
that's the game i've played the most, i think it's been a decade this year lol
yo I played a lot of Smite in like 2013-2014 lmao
I recently joined a VGC draft league and I think in draft closed team sheets is a lot more reasonable than tournament/ladder
i loved ORAS, i though sun/moon was good, Ultra sun and ultra mood was dumb and i never touched it
same the only reason I came back to pokemon was VGC lol
I think draft is really cool
never touched either versions of black/white
black and white is probably one of the best pokemon games they made
"gamefreak fucked up" i wasn't listening to what you were saying but that applies to so many things
It's getting better, I think but rough start for sure
its ugly and runs like shit
Even the fucking dolphin is bad
i really enjoy walking into a field and getting 2 fps
at least gen 9 didnt ALSO pull gen 7
only thing bearable about gen 9 was the barebones story that deadass gave me feelings and im MAD i got feelings about that crap game
It's a good but flawed game imo
the story atleast isn't that bad
actually had some cool character developement
I cant stand looking at that game or playing it very long though
story is only good quality about that game with all the charcaters from the factions coming together at the end i CRIED
You all complain about the fps like zelda 64 was 60 fps KEKW
@SwiftPichu_ a modern console shouldn't be the same fps as oot
And I will say DLC improved that a lot
@SwiftPichu_ its 2024 the game shouldn't be as ambitios as it tried to be to fail that so spectacularly
switch has that problem in general
Yeah nozo but no one gave a shit when it was 20 fps, same thing different times
DLC makes Tera grinding WAY easier
no one cared that zelda 64 was low frames when that was the STANDARD
theres several 3d pokemon games that not only look better, they play better and run better
The standard was 30 fps not 20
and non of them were made by gamefreak
like playing gen 9 just wanted to make me play swsh again
even the 3ds games run better than scarlet and voilet
one thing i hated about scarlet and violet is how they cucked us for character customization
we should just start our own XD VGC league that'll be so much cooler and more fun than the lame ass modern games :D
they keep doing it and it makes me mad
xy was a free for all with customization- then sun/moon you were throttled for color based on game
Im not judging it by the older games, im judging it by the fact they have practice with the switch, and have done well before, yet produced such shitty quality
SWSH was a free for all- then gen 9 cucked you not ONLY on color but also forced school uniforms
also lets be honest arceus wasn't super good looking but it PLAYED well
why does scarlet not play well?
@PeachedPocky dont forget the backpack stuff 🤣
it literally steals most the mechanics lol
as much as I am very much neutral to eevee, there being a fluffy backpack shown off in the game and it not being gettable for your own character succcks
I should try an Emerald randomizer. I've dohne quite a few Crystal seeds.
like SWSH and XY are goted for me only bcuz character customization are SO ON POINT
@Jonxhas THAT MADE ME SO MAD GIMMIE THE BACKPACK
Like FIR settings, which is pretty intriguing to watch as well.
But what have you liked more? KIR or FIR?
Gale is best rando cause it's linear AF :P
I've been looking forward to gen2 in archipelago
crystal is my fav and i stand firmly on that, vanilla at least, i haven't done crystal rando, only emerald
is there something about crystal in archipelago I should be wary of?
I do like the Crystal logic.
i wanna do an emerald rando bcuz it feels easy to get into
@TeeJayOhNine currently crystal in AP is more gen4 HGSS oriented with map changes then staying on vanilla
i think a rando nuzlocke would be fun to try ive never done a pokemon rando before
which in a way makes me think people want to supplement the lack of gen4 AP logic rando into the crystal implement to an extent
which - I can see both ways really - and it should therefore be an option people choose with "old" and "modern" maps and respectively logic for items
or - how it usually goes with that: someone did a thing, people liked it, it stays and no one questions it from then other then people who knew vanilla vanilla like the back of their hand PrideLaugh
not always a bad thing mind!
.. i should look into that, i now want to do a pokemon randomizer
i know axl is working on one for emerald
Like a full item randomizer or just the Pokemon?
the only thing I dont get about pokemon rando is what makes it interesting
emerald has an AP based key item + everything else rando
with lots to toggle and do if you feel like it
did you do the Merlon super boots check?
AND unlike crystals implement to AP, the map change stuff you can have is options you can opt in / out of
start of chapter 1 kooper check?
btw while this discussion started earlier, I did manage to convince the fish, but I need to feel it out for more consistency as to what I am trying to do PrideLaugh
@Jonxhas yeah I've done an AP with someone who did full dexsanity. 1250 checks komari1S
@TeeJayOhNine HA cant be me tippiAFirret
Emerald rando seems like it'd be fun if I knew anything about gen3
Not sure if you're gonna be able to finish this rando in time, which is unfortunate.
i've got my 3ds capture card now
I dont know much about gen3 past what the map tracker tells me really KEKW
true, trackers can help a lot with unfamiliar randos.
it's been awesome so far, as i can do randos on it cause of a gba emu on it lol
Time to dig up the log KEKW
which then - I played like 6 seeds and now I at least know about the most stupid roundabouts logic in Emerald can throw at you
btw we're still on for Minish Cap right? oranThink
nah category is set to pape tippiTap
ohp I misunderstood that KEKW my bad 😅
there are other zelda games i know well that id loive to rando- but they require a 3ds capture card which i do not have r i p
just check one chapter again mayby it coms but stay arund is time waste
yo, there's an oot 3d rando lol
Does the tracker not show the checks completed?
MM3D's also uses a patch to make it more MM based for controls in regards to things like zora mask
I hate it when you have to retrace your steps for randos
it's prolly some obscure hidden panel somewhere idk where tho
Last time I saw this happen to you, it was a check you could scout early on but forgot about when you could  get the item.
vulcano the chest other side by the hammer 3 upgrade
phantom, unrelated, what is on your bed behind you i wanna see the stuffies
did you ever go back to ch1 to get the block after fuzzys
the tunic fox, one of those nut shooters from zelda 1 and a digimon i think
What is the sushi check in town?
did you go in the pipe at the sushi check?
And this is how Phantom learned to cheat in all future PM randos
not like ms mowz is rn c.c
do your shure got the chest behinde the 3hamer block on the upgrade 3hammer
silly bugger aint talkin to me when I need her to
At times like this you gotta think like Goombario and ask yourself "is it really cheating the game doesn't show me the way? Make my own rules at this point."
you had ultra but dont go ther the secon time
Nice coin count before this seed is over
ok I finally got my pipes open KEKW
Yea most races are intended to be glitchless, I assume to even out the playing field, there's people that know glitches and people who don't
for some reason when i do ultra hammer skip whenever i fall oob at the end i always hit the wrong loading zone
silly question to ttyd phantom: you dont recall if I need to go through the pipes to make them work, do you?
do the save glitch crash in this room, that's a fitting way to end this seed :P
i always hit the top loading zone
He's currently holding a door open
always take me a couple trys
why does he make it easier?
they add a circle under the B now
gerbieWave I fell asleep earlier, how did the tp race go?
you can also do the glitch again to store a real save and crash the game anywhere iirc.
sushi: "where we're going, we don't need roads"
goombario being useful for nonsense adds up KEKW
so THIS is how fire cheep get born
but I dont think you're supposed to swim in the ground
what was the point of the parkour
if you can just get hit by the lava and fly to the top
oh go to toad town and show off the bombette on the minigame tree :D
you heard it folks that's allowed in races now
i clicked someones profile and you showed up
I decided to check this out
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
OMG nice what a going away present
ah okay. Yeah I've never played a Xenoblade game.
they seem weird lol at least plot wise lmao.
Your sog choice today goes hard
I think my favorite action RPG is NIER. I love that game so much.
it's also got one of the most gorgeous soundtracks ever.
The Drakengard series as a whole is fun but the other entries are very jank.
well action as in like not turnbased
Hello Phantom! Hope you are doing well! phanto274BLANKIES
Bravely Default II is a fucking masterpiece
altho that game is like 3 years old by now.
Bravely Default is basically like a modernized version of FFV and FFV is prolly the greatest turn based RPG ever made imo.
I agree tho that I don't like action RPGs. I played hours of the final fantasy pixel remakes on switch
I never played the first one lol
or the 2nd one Bravely Second lol
Bravely Default II has the same thing but it resets time right before the final boss and then you go do a different final boss (spoiler alert lol) so it's much much better than that.
so you don't replay the whole game lmao
only DQ game I've played is VIII which I enjoyed
i seen a speed run of dq11 and the dude beat the true final boss at level 35 like HUH
i try him at level 70ish and got clap
Speaking of Square Enix I'm playin through FFVI SNES rn
hot take not a big fan of final fantasy
I wanna do an archipeligo of FFV, FFVI, FFXII since they're my 3 fave FF games but I haven't played VI in a while so I gotta refresh myself.
5 and 6 are my favorites
I thought everyone hates XIII lol
which 13 tho? isn't there three games for it?
i got stuck near the end of 13 and never beat it
then 12 part 2 got to final dungeon and quit KEKW
XII is my favorite game combat wise if for no other reason than combat takes place in the overworld lol.
it save so much time not having to go in and out of battle every time lmao.
Square Enix just declined in quality
They just now mostly outsource projects
Let alone their major titles being massive money sinks
That fail to make back the costs of how much it took to develop them
yo made it just in time
SadgeBusiness someone just sent me a shovel now have to do the sub area all over again YEP
Look what happened to Kingdom Hearts
Takes way too long for a title to come out, same deal with Final Fantasies nowadays
phantom I sent your press and 30 bugfrags and someone else sent you pet case
Never played a KH game. Not a disney person so I have no interest in it really.
KH2 is hailed at the magnum opus of KH games
But yeah sever decline after that
I whish someone would send me 50K
it was in a shop i was like YEP they prob want this
whip that hair back and forth PrideUwu
right after roopa quit I found his hookshot lol
last night I stayed up later subbing an anime music video
some of those are misconstrued bc of me being here
GL with the glitches! lueygaGoodLuck phanto274GL
no hidden panel / coin sanity?
this pape racetime is the funniest shit ive seen all day
the first comment was " i assume we need to be on the same seed?" KEKW
Yo different seed racing league when?
then they rolled a seed and posted the url number without using the bot command
ooh sushi into chapter 2 XD
And who needs to make life shrooms when they're just right here
Someone is dropping all these fast food items
Only thing missing is a burger
Getting a lot of good shite here
Saw your run at pax looks like it was an interesting seed for sure
Life shrooms aren't a problem this seed
I thought I had started to grow out of games. Astro bot showed me it's the games that had lost their way.
well its a free game already on your PS5 lol
while it does have some gimmicks like the touchpad you may not be a fan of its a really fun time.
we need a useful cutscene setting for this so you can have that cutscene where Stanley o7
If glitch logic ever becomes a race setting, don't include this. XD
woooo i love gorge void in pape 64
i got it 2 times can never find a setup to swim on land just got lucky
yo phantom, gl gl gonna lurk while i eat a burrito
Would using a metronome to try and time it be against the rules?
i had to look at a vid for this part
Hate to get political but ah
metronome isnt a bad idea but what would you sync with
i did this once so didn't remember
Oh I looked away at discord for a sec and you got it. Nice!
rip cheato dressed like "shit. let's be santa"
Oh yeeeeeah, I remember this glitch from one of your other seeds on youtube.
buff and black u made it in!
Can't remember which one though. XD
NOTED might need to keep this in mind
this doesn't even looks that bad
NPC push into Ruins logic when??? :D
I like when the characters are different colors
hopefully its going better than my day has lol
which ones can you do the glitches on?
this game has the best music ever
also whats the deal with ads being 50 million times louder
kinda frustrating getting my ears blasted
the main thing is they ignore the audio slider when they first play
so they just play at max volume
in the vanilla version I’m trying to get all the badges.
yeah im not complaining about the ads more just the volume being scuffed
so I get my ears blown out anytime an ad starts
anytime I bleed it'll look like a visual effect
so after looking at the standings I believe asyncs will push me outta 24
all that for a stinky herb
im 19 and the 20 21 22 23 and 24 are all not far off me
so I think if they all asynced I'll just get shoved out
i dont have time to do that lmao
I’ve I played this it would take me a bit. yes I know how to play the vanilla version but I would want to explore. and just have fun
id have to sub 1 every seed
Im not good enough to compete in main bracket anyway
I can literally path into every item, skip 50 checks, and hit go mode at 30 mins and still lose by 30 minutes
so its kinda like whats the point lol
I'll have to see if I feel like it
well everyone knows I'm the best PrideUwu
since I’ve never played a rando I would suck.
if I do another rando like right, I don't think I would finish too hot PrideLaugh
or you mean like actual sucking? LOL
im very unsure what makes me so much worse than the top rando players outside of just execution
and thats not a gap i can close cuz they have too many years of experience
gotta work on your luck, it's just that simple
this pop tracker for seasons is so ass saying i can get power bracelet checks when i don't have power bracelet Madge
also I enjoy your stream anyway
I wonder if it would be hard to set up minish cap and learn it
my favorite rando is paper mario
it sure as hell aint BN6 KEKW
personally my favorite rando is Ori
its loike a pokemon rando that only shuffles movesets
metroidvanias make the best randos I think.
I dont like the way SM mechanically plays
zero mission is a better game just because it doesnt have a dash button
@Axl_SR Wrong. It's better cuz you can aim with one button.
YEP i just check the ap discord
F R O W G G Y
guess i got to ping someone about the seasons tracker oh wait i know that i cant do x YEP
I'd look VERY weird if that didn't work
you really gotta ask ME that?
I don’t see them just the name of it
well you can see the emote cause it's on your stream but it's in like 32p
with the name though makes me think anime
what kind of phone did you go with?
I have an iPhone so it’s no good for me
cuz I bloody loathe twitch mobile in its current state
wait I can get frosty on iPhone!
yeah, I'm overdue for an upgrade. I'm thinking the pixel, I kinda want to fuck around with grapheneOS
okay, 1st impressions of Frosty's is VERY good
I'd consider being able to see useful but *shrug*
I did not see this going plus 2
We know a Parakarry upgrade is on Merlow
I like Jello with whipped cream
As for flavors dunno, most of them just gel with me other than like I think lime
I like lemon lime jello. it’s so good. and I suppose
Not in a gambling mood right now
@AngelLove94 blue jello but since dad was cookin red and whipped cream added def.
if lime wasn’t available I’d pick blue raspberry or regular raspberry
Now will you finish the seed first or will my lap cheung sausage chicken rice bowl topped with 2 eggs finish cooking
Which one will force you to double dip? YEP
So yep Tubba castle is a forced double dip
Wow, Tubba's Castle had everything except what you wanted
Maybe Bow has the key you wanted all along
So what remains is it just a Palace Key?
That too to get into KBF
Whelp it was a forced double dip for Tubba
Could be in a worse spot though
So just a seed for go mode
My guess is seed will make you dip Crystal Palace for one or both go items
Or Bow could save us with a seed
Either way Crystal Palace will put you into Go
i was talking to some of the speed runners
have you tried to do a glitched logic seed glitchless yet?
and they were saying "6:01 for reverse left side full clear"
and im like "I literally cant be faster than 6:45"
6:45 is the fastest I can full clear left side reverse city
im timing it more cuz im practicing dungeons
cuz im tired of being bad
thats 6:45 with every chest btw
voiding out makes the pehats move faster
so you get over there a bit faster
guess what i check the ap discord and something else in the pape auto tracker doesn't track YEP
I grab the tree trunk chest
and the pehat will already be flying through the gap
so you can just claw it and go over
I can show you my run if you want
I'll post it in the discord
All I got from this palace was a stinking record
Did the Crystal Palace hold anything of value
ima post it on your cord in randos so you can see the strats
So all of KBFy for the palace key huh
Got here in time for go mode phanto274Smile
With this particular Fortress location, HS might have been fast but idk
rip koopa bros, already lost befor the fight started...
is going here worse than vanilla chapter 7?
Big chilling. How are the seeds going?
damn my day went from bad to worse
I order a pizza, I walk outside and the shits on the floor opened and my pizza all over the ground
so now Im waiting for a replacement
1 thing is they didn't tell me when it arrived
so it could arrive for like 5 mins and an animal knocked it over
so im not mad at them
just kinda like "literally nothings working out for me today"
i need to lose like 80 pounds  NODDERS
@nozomup oh, this is gonna be a scuffed Bowser, huh
Not to mention the money you sink into trucks
is this the only one we playing today?
yay! I love watching you play this.
someone is chat is a good luck charm. jkjk
the ghost hiding in the box is cute. oh dang it’s gone
what time zone so I know to be here
I’ll be here for stream tomorrow. that’s if I’m not napping
I will be back though have to move laundry around
Woah what, 3:33? What kind of seed was this?
not a dev but i know how its work YEP
i thought dicts were supposed to not be ordered anyway???
So just don't change it YEP
that item should of been put at the very bottom but no
if you can't get around not breaking things when that dict changes, there should minimally be a comment
and an obvious one. Something like, "IF YOU TOUCH THIS, YOU RISK BREAKING THE WORLD"
why's there not an ID field?
I guess I don't fully understand why there isn't an ItemIndex field in the location_table so that it doesn't matter if that list is sorted or not. There are probably more things that rely on it being in a particular order...
but stop making me think about programming on my days off plzkthx
oh yeah idk if you looked at the thing but I sent it in the rando channel
WeLoveGoombario I'm useful to Mario like I knew I would be
Rawr. Just finished a league race. 4 hours
Touching Lava = Bad guwuNoted lunacy4Noted
Does glitch logic account for you bringing Sushie into Ruins?
In any case, there are the first 2 checks waiting for you whenever you go back that way
so if i start spamming nonstop paper mario season 3 seeds RIGHT now
how would I do in the tournament
people that can knit and crochet are awesome. I personally can not do either
@nozomup If you stream I’ll come cheer you on.
i think if it was glitched it would be allot harder
cuz then you have all of the tricks to learn
the hardest part will be learning where the checks are and stuff
I don’t know what my special talent is. I haven’t figured it out yet
At least finding Parakarry there means you never have to fight that Hyper Cleft again
i saw you doing it but not the start of it lol
but typically you have a hammer by this point LO
no wonder it took so long for the glitch to be found
Have you not done hammerless LP skip before? Or was it just jumpless?
I guess you didn't pay attention to the Piranha Plant scaling
grind can be fun tho, you just have to make it fun
Like literally so fucking boring lol
Axl grinding in smt is boring as shit
oh yeah, fuck grinding in smt
I'm doing that just to kill the final boss because I can't do enough damage for the threshold
i have to grind in my 1 gacha game and i am too lazy
I swear finding mitamas is almost the same as shiny hunting, but more boring
Sushie start in glitch logic is very brain-breaking
Do you know if Kooper is good?
I think it's Bedge time for me but phanto274GL on the rest of the seed!
it’s not even 8:30 here so I’ll be up for awhile
i heard people talking that banjo AP got updates recently
(Blue -> Fire -> Grenade -> Ice -> Clockwork)
but will Brian say it? Kappa
oh this is only the second seed? was the other one rough
oh i didn't know doopliss was a mob in pape 64
the double coin bug is very odd lmao
i have a hard time doing elevator pitches too KEKW i have a much easier time being like "this person is great hell yeah"
woah it's a lot of content
(have been following for years now lmao)
yeah that's me atm, because i didn't qual i'm focusing on TWW again, probably gonna finish learning SS too
yeah, i'm pushing the 3d zelda challenge, they're all SD
yeah i've had people ask why not wwhd but the actual leaderboard has an SD version and a remake version
I have MS RTA on my mind and SS and WW are HD lol
yeah, there's technically 2, there's "2D Zelda Games" and "3D Zelda Games"
3D has the 3D challenge ofc, 2D has things like the "triathalon" which is z1-3 most popular categories each
Z2 seems like a not fun thing to learn lmao
all wr holders end up mentally fucked up
all I'm gonna say about nmg
yeah doing like, major glitch categories
i've def had an interest in RBO and AD Swordless, and glan's run at SGDQ was great
what about SM64, OOT, Goldeneye triathlon run? :P
that's a thing idk if people do it much tho cause I mean it's 3 very different genres don't know how many peeps are dece at speedrunning all 3 lol.
lopez is the only one of the friend group who runs sm64 huh
i should do a sub 30 for a 16 star KEKW
yeah it def seems pretty easy to do
16  star is easy the tricks are free
like when i saw carpetless i went "that is a medium-difficulty OoT trick"
the real chaotic peeps are the ones that do blindfolded 16 star
oh yeah the blindfolded stuff is always cool
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
would be cool to get 3:39 this year lol
really just depends how much i play
twitch just fucked up and gave me like 4s of a last ad
like it just fucked up giving me the correct timing of ad
so i just watched a man holding a trombone and then it came back KEKW
best and fave i see u twice!
i imagine, i dont mess with glitch stuff KEKW
wait shuffled dungeons are a thing now?
I'm really out of it then KEKW
been a thing for almost 2 years
ALRIGHT! KICK HIM IN THE DICK!
christ in a hand basket, that was quite a fight
okay now how come this shit don't work in peoples' runs?
I have something funny arriving at my doorstep on Monday, I'll be posting about it in the Discord assuming all goes well
Thanks for another great stream Phantom!
tbf i just happened to finish a run early enough to not still be on KEKW
you easily couldve had that one lol
He's tryna stay at 69 firsts :P
btw ill be on coms iwth rigby for this race
I think Phantom wins today's race.
45 minutes of starting soon KEKW
The start of Phantoms 9-3 season, how exciting
the logic for the tracker for seasons is so ass
Adam is the first victim then?
i finished all my checks just it time. Ive got 115 checks left
i havent been paying attention so ill be surprised
I've been watching a 100% run of Yugioh Forbidden Memories. But it's the Pokémon mod. Archie was a pain in the rear for the person playing. Took over a 100 tries, even with 15 card drop, to get Primal Kyogre.
im surprised you didnt make it
@Axl_SR enjoy that  mystic ticket idk what its does
@blacktiger51 it give me lugia and ho-oh for legend hunt. My goal is catch 9 legends so that is huge for me.
wait are we supposed to be live KEKW
I have 2 already for reference
Im blaming adam for being late anyways
its a just chatting stream rn
you mean you dont open the raceroom at XX:X1?
yeah, and you are locked to specific times
the last one started at like 9am my time, I was still in bed
plus the french part of the community
Idk why I didnt think of it
whens last you heard from M4?
ps your front ain't got no sig
I fouund you another sword lol
oh nice the logic is right on the tracker now cuz i found my  power bracelet Kappa
oh hell yeah imma chop stuff down
also right after you left I got your hookshot lol
good thing you started the room early
Rando bot is looking for those herbs ans spices
Ready for the quintuple ruins dio seed
Mandatory goombario? That seed wasnt bad at all then!
He may be a troll, but at least he's good for glitches
Im a racetime mod now, that was fast
Have to house sit so it's a shit show and have to mute most of the time
just woke up and brushed my teeth
I'mma need y'all to vote against Banjo-Kazooie in the poll
@buff00n don't worry i voted star fox adventures
everyone got their water and some snacks?
my mom and dad have those big cups lol
So I guess the seed is all about them Peaches
can't eat just yet cuz I brushed my teeth
it feels like you have to wait forever sometimes
time to get comfy with my weighted blanket
Which partner do you think we'll start with?
Less than a minute to go
yo all 1 cost badges seed
Gl on the run, Good to be back watching stream (btw it's me Thekillerstar564 changed name)
well at least that wasn't a coin :P
ooh GL on the race and run.
my shadow queen double pain win was a couple boo capes paperLurk sorry HahaSweat brain is in wake up mode and somethin tickled my thought on that sentence PrideFlower
hope you're well and the seed's cookin cool thins so far
how was the bn1 single segment
huh maybe I should try it after bn4
oh its just like the bn2 one
oh if this is a race do you both have the same seed?
Even the trees are laughing at the seed
What is needed for the most progress at the moment? I'd think super boots and the last seed needed to get to 6.
well then good luck and have MISERY
surely the ultra shroom would have just hovered over the hole in the floor
wild to think that chapter 3 was locked behind chapter 3, which was locked behind chapter 5
right, i did forget to mention that chapter 5 was also locked behind 3
my bad, hi phantom and chat. was lurking a bit 😅
nothin wrong with a good lurk
so all peach sections are skipped?
how many randomizers are you playing... I think I saw you in TPR, didn't know you also play PMR brotin1Wow
so this is the right place to learn stuff NOTED
i rather do moles and laki then that shit check
are star points capped at 99?
so this is what a pmr speedrun looks like LUL
where have u not checked that u can go?
the charge is stackable? sorry if I'm aksing too many questions
That's a brutal place for last item
you make these fights look so silly LUL
One last shop for hopes and dreams
25% of the time it works every time!
Hope this bowser fight goes well despite this seed sucking
So far, it really seems like the theme of all S3 official rave seeds is "Hot Garbage"
Hot garbage if no chapter 4 in the 4 chosen chapters
from the practice seeds Phantom did and this one it seems like if chapter 4 is logic it's fine, if chapter 4 isn't logic it's hot garbage.
You guys were neck and neck until the hunt for dirt
My guess is boots is in 4
yeah he was looking for dirt as well
Oof sorry Adam, but phanto274GG to him too
where the fucking fuck was soil
I didn't even know that was a check
I always thought that was ultra boots
i was peeking at adam stream
I literally did not know that was a thing
Give Adam a phanto274GG too for running this shite
I had 3 chapters at like 1:25:xx
I thought I was going pretty good
WeLoveGoombario is such a cursed start
I got weight, went back, got sushie, and then checked mansion
I'm low key kinda pissed that that block is even in logic
I just started going through panels once I found ultra boots and I did prologue first
oh yeah did you ever get ultra boots phantom?
At a ramen hot pot place. You pay $38 and you gotta eat most of your food, otherwise you pay for the waste .
Dessert is free. They've made a horrible mistake.
Me, I'll engage treadmill walking while putting stream in back
I need to just pop off
Hopefully next seed isn't as bad placing stuff
it's literally made by the people who made twitter originally iirc.
It's Twitter without being a massive dumpster fire.
phanto274GL on hopefully a not shite seed
I've gone through a slice of cheesecake, mango pudding, mochi and am currently waiting on some mango tango cake thing
rigby was the first to remember it
I wasn't watching the whole thing, but it was funny. I jumped into the restream and you were both approaching tubba key simultaneously
it was very very close other than that
the mango tango was okay, the cheesecake was BOMB
think of it this way   ur allways gonna remeber to check it if needed now
I do feel like that check is easier to remember when the bridge is visible but it's been a while since anyone has seriously played with the bridge visible
also adam went to tubbas after sushie and still managed to catch up
Most of the badges being cheap last seed was what salvaged it
yeah I totally forgot about it even tho you passed it twice.
I got screwed by that check in one of my first runs, so now I check it every time I can
darn I missed out on everything
you missed out on the search for a jar of dirt
phanto274Wave phanto274BLANKIES stonee1Huh minimi6Link minimi6Shroom zachliO mralbe2D
hospital still suck so im happy i can actually watch u tonight
The League site SHOULD be able to handle DNFs now. Apparently my race yesterday was the first one where someone DNF'd
Best that ads come when we're just waiting lol
between food and dog out I wouldnt be able to make this race
oh snap, mightykeef did a skit of sony reacting to concord flopping LUL
atleast we get happy music while waiting
Fingers crossed I actually manage to finish this one. All of my races I bombed horribly and ended up dnf'ing so far lol
how did you feel about it before that check?
I feel like every seed I do on these settings, I come across a new check that I completely forget about and commit to memory for all future runs
yeah, adam did tubbas but not having super boots blocked the magical seed
sounds like a horrible SM map rando seed
Varia locked behind 3 hell runs and Ridley blocks the way to Maridia map
I chuckled seeing the pause menu map
My last seed was awful for that, because you needed a seed so you could go to chapter 6, so you could find a tubba key and enter the first locked door and find fish, so you could then get into jade jungle, so you could then actually get through the seed
Same, going out of the way with just one is brutual
Managed to finally finish my treadmill run of the day
Alright, gonna get outta here before the race starts. Good luck phantom
how many are in the room?
But maybe we can get some better luck in
Life shroom in shop not bad tho
why is it just items all over place
Trash seed. No ch4, but yes ch7? GARBAGE
Whoever cursed this seed with bad RNG got their wish
I hate it when a decent badge has really good BP but bad FP
"please open panels now" the game says
kinda wild how you went into final with 30 HP and still got peril lol
Oh cool a PM64 rando chambo2Party
Phantom rigging races to their own benefit phanto274Thonk
do you HAVE to save Kolorado?
But its the coolest,beside Bowser and Crystal King chambo2Shy
so your plan is still to go back and do volcano before moving on?
I Cross my Fingers for ya
oh i asked you in dms phantom but did you wanna hang out tonight after your run?
oh season 3 added item pouches
what do item pouches do? Increase inventory space?
+2 from the normal maximum, or did they remove slots?
they might have just missed that item
wow reloading the room killed them
or do you just kinda plat
I also assume 3 of the stars dont have to be obtained
so you look at the 4 at the start to tell
and that tells you what items you need
are the worlds that the other stars are in dead as well?
are ther cheks for the blou key
I like how the coin trap there is just "lose one item"
dont wanna sait when you walk to the ruins
Mario World Tour in this seed
now that was some good phanto274Nom HypeNom NomNom now for some rando madness
I will never redeem bad RNG again after this, my bad
youu miss 2keys for 3 and 7
I suppose that in these settings you want to see Chapter 4 and 7
How is it that 2 trash seeds were rolled today
always love a good sub 2 FF
probably some panel in some shit ass location
i wasn't here the whole seed
are we allowed to throw out ideas?
letters aren't items in the settings
i call the musik disc but wher is this shit
that's the entire LTTP tourney flags in a nutshell
I don’t blame you it’s very frustrating sounding
did we do hungry ass yoshi
Won't blame you for doing so
you do what’s best for you. we followers will still be here
Like how did the community vote for these settings
I think the community wanted to try out the new settings is what drove these choice of settings
yeah what's in chapter 4 I wonder lmao
coin shuffle is fun in a casual seed playing standpoint
yeah I didn't get the race settings options they gave, idk if any of the others woulda been less awful but this seems awful especially when no chapter 4.
and I'm pretty sure that was in all 4 options
watt upgrades are dumb this seed
Yeah panelsanity has always been my least favorite option
Gonna make a mod of the game where every check is a panel
but you never find the ultra hammer or super boots
lets just have everything sanity race settings. I want people going into dojo for checks and doing the letter chain quest
Did you figure out where it was? Sorry had to take a phonecall
Fair enough, I mean we did talk about it a while ago KEKW
omg I am with everyone who said they hate panels
It's too much dipping for tourneys
Like so far I've only seen a double, but there's potential for a triple dip
OK nvm it happened already lmao
But even then no hints so how would you know, fuck, this is too cursed ngl KEKW
3 or 4 has a metric fuck ton of coins regardless
I'm beginning to understand why oot always bases the shuffles from the standard root lol
If that's not an indicator that the settings are ultra cursed, idk what is
i say gn and see you neyt time
oh perfect i helped her set that up
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
I’m curious of what this game is so I’ve come to see
gonna have dinner rn but I'm super excited for this. IMO this is the greatest game ever made, I love it so much.
basically it's Zelda but you're a Wolf and you use skills by painting @AngelLove94
Yeah figured it was about that wolf
Amaterasu think was the name of the controllable character
I have one of paper mario randos on YouTube playing right now
my usb snes controllers got here today and there feel good
ok we set now command us up
ur video feed of this game is spectacular.
Okami rando would be so much fun I wish it existed
are exorcism slips banned lmao? or is this like before you can get any? cause they are absurdly busted.
what version are you playin btw?
Sorry I put oil on the log
this trick seems very difficult yeah
It's probably easier to jump from the back to the tip of the log
No I mean to get into position
you'd have to get it first try for it to be worth I feel like
after that you're prolly losing time
2nd try would prolly be even
how much have you played this game casually?
you can exit these btw by hitting the glowing parts of the wall
you don't need to hit all of em
once it changes color just jump into it
you only need to hit one of em
I was hoping luigis mansion had a rando but doesnt seem to be the case
yeah you gotta squiggly with rejuvination
easier or harder than the other one? :P
oh so you can get close enough to just midair slash em? neat
I assume that's what the trick is at least.
rotating the camera is a glitch???
how does clearing up the water make islands appear btw? I wanna understand the chemistry of that LUL
well more stepping stones than islands but still
oh you can just skip the rest of the tutorial? nice XD
so im chilling watching you learn while I learn a different speed run lol
it's faster to go outside than it is to finish the tutorial, didn't know that.
maybe I'll try to speedrun this again too and see if I can beat Phantom lmao.
gotta get the loading demon fangs!
the music in this game for bosses is just horror themed
currently strugglin cus I wanna get my TTYD cheevo mastery - guess which cheevo I am missing if you roughly know the list
I think my notes summary would be like 1 page cause like I've memorized this entire game pretty much XD it's just important item locations and a couple skips that aren't casual that I'd have to have notes for.
I mean you can always just set it to day
you know a good way to get 15 power bounces in ttyd perchance? I know I am askin off topic stuff
yeaaa I mean timing it - I got a couple 14s but you know - it only counts if I get the 15th >.>
are demon fangs important to the run at all?
they must be cause save mirror right?
Would the gold ink pots be important since you need ink?
I mean that's the NG+ run in a nutshell :P
I also forgor about inkfinity stones
I'm so glad I never used exorcism slips casually, they ruin so many fun boss fights
Is this on PC or console?
what did you name the plush?
but yeah if you need to get demon fangs you might want to learn the loading screen mini-games it might save a fight or two if you need to grind for em lmao.
:') my fly is in sootopolis so its a trek everywher rn
for the record I didnt roll that seed so not my fault KEKW
no, but i had to make a settings change lmao
axl had it set to gym badges anywhere and i wanted them shuffled LMAO
is any% that different from glitchless?
im gonna head out for a bit to go eat tho, i havent eaten in like 8 hours and all i had was a muffin LMAO
@Axl_SR any% NG+ is fun, you should check the vids I posted in the discord
also i imagine the any% route is different by version? like PS2, wii, PS4, Switch, ect. with fixes between versions?
NG+ HD versions have patched KT glitch so NG+ any% you gotta use PS3
does this have any interesting movement options?
interesting no, only annoying movement options
my only experience with this was I rented it on wii and lost interest 2 hours in. Granted that was like 15 years ago and im sure my interests have changed
yeah you can't wait around here lol
yeah wtf are you doing inside a cave with no entrance
I think just open pause menu
@Axl_SR true, 14 pouwer bounces is too good ;-;
i dont even know how to say that
and wtf is this dog doing in a bamboo???
yeah he seemed to be enjoying it
and wtf is this dog doing in hell dimension waiting for you to rejuvinate it? :P
At least this dog is in a reasonable spot XD
He was in hell dimension with the other one ig but finding the other 4 released him :P
well you rejuvenated him, I thought you sent his ass to the after life tbh
Hey lady we found your dogs! Now time to find more dogs!
wait do you not have to talk to her?
oh yeah you need this to be night too iirc
if only we had the power of nighttime :(
I cannot watch okami but gl practice
you will be in the window I will not open but the view will be there
so how was your day, Phantom?
yeah there should be I think?
can it not change if your in here?
yeah we don't care bout bird, only dog
once you have wind you can use that to speed him up but iirc the 2nd digging minigame isn't required.
this dog totally one up'd the other bamboo sleeping dog by warping between bamboo XD
enemies really can't handle bomb defense lol
ah yes the great saki mission
whopper with a side of dog
yeah I'd think it would be faster doing this first than waiting for nighttime but idk
there is a spring here by the dojo iirc
yeah I forgot you can just do it early
of him explaining it to you
yeah and you get a nice cutscene of nothing when you enter gale shrine too
Was just watching the yugioh VR demo... I cant believe we got this before GTA6 LUL
That will make me line up for PSVR2
see he's good he didn't even need our help for that attack
well he needed our wind but he cut Crimson something or another down himself.
yeah you're 25% of the way through the game :D
yeah up to orochi seems fine
yeah it's just festival shenanigans then moon cave iirc
I was a sword doggo man myself.
but yeah beads are fun too
beads are the best secondary by far
just rejuvenate the stairs easy :P
I'm surprised you don't need fangs for the mirror but ig you don't really need to warp anywhere by the time you get it.
auride make the guide, and lego glitchlessifed it
so im learning tp glitchless 1 section at a time, like "intro to diababa, diababa to fyrus" etc, im wondering if this is a less effective way than just doing the entire run
atm im gonna go up to master sword and run that for a bit
wand then I'll start doing post master sword segements
Id do hd but I don't have a wii u so
yeah cause gold gate takes time
yeah it's gotta let you know that this is indeed a gold gate and it does indeed save your progress :P
me when the game has tutorials like midway through still
gotta make a super fancy design!
why does that remain on your face lol
I love how the locks freak tf out when you bring the key near
true, being a lock in this world would suck so bad. You can't move at all and if anyone brings a key near you you get merc'd
Atleast your existence has an end
true if I was a lock I'd be like thank you I'm finally free if someone brought a key to me!
yeah, no arbitrarily selected glitches :P
that mask must be super glued on lmao
you should get a 0.1 sec time bonus for every bork you do during a run :P
be back but how are things going?
I don't get to play my challenge cup match till round 2
I played a bit of Okami
I'm a master of the fuckin backlog apparently
@nozomup yeah it means both "god", and "wolf"
mmmm, eye, lips, and liver stew
orochi waitin for his eye, lips, and liver stew!
no it's at the very end
Dogs got called okami for their association with the spirit of the mountain
oh I never knew wind revealed it lol
Ah, good old Okami. One of my favourite games
more orb pushing puzzles! At least this one isn't awful.
Sorry I haven't been in streams for a while. Got a bit burned out on livestreams in general. Slowly getting back into 'em though
Is this an any% route you're trying to learn?
yeah this game is pretty long
I might be thinking of it being long purely cause of cutscenes
But you'd be skipping all of them
finally we can complete our horn, eyeball, lips, and liver stew :D
I have the absolute fondest memories of Okami
and still have PTSD over the old couples house
I was like.. in elementary school/early middle school and played this on the ps2 when it came out
and that traumatized me SOOO bad
I was like 5 or 6 when I first played it so I think I was too young to understand what was going on lmao.
Yeah they used remixed sound effects from BK during some of the game
we gonna kill orochi with pots?
Well you do get him drunk. I guess high is close enough in terms of inebriation
you can also miss it tho
buy 20 exorcism slips, kill everything in 1 second
Is this the HD remaster? The Steam one?
this is switch version but yeah
I *think* some bosses nullify the slips, don't they?
It's been a while... Maybe I'm thinking of something else
if the boss is invuln to reg attacks you can't slip em, but otherwise they're all vulnerable to em.
yeah this is the most complex fight in the game prolly. And you get to do it 3 times!
.....Crap yeah it IS 3... Brain was only remembering 2
split on beautiful imp mask painting :D
well 2.5 cause you don't do the first phase on the ark.
not that the first phase is very long.
Yeah it's really not. I don't think the health scales either for the last one, does it? You've got a stronger weapon so it's done quickly
yeah it's the same HP so it's very quick.
this first fight is also super cutscene heavy yeah lmao
Second fight kinda is too lol
easiest gate to dodge in the game
how are you liking this game?
also this is prolly my fav song in the game
you gotta get em drunk twice I think.
and now for the real fight
I honestly don't remember the fight being this involved
this is such a badass boss i return to
gotta make wood sword into gold sword
aww rip getting to see Susano do the work himself for once
yeah gg for act 1 :D
it's just get 3 heads drunk twice, hit bell, murder all heads
I'm 2k away from being able to request a rando :O
Congrats on the run last night at Aki's~
Okami rando that's Zelda right? (if only it existed :( )
its my fault for being a gremlin
shoulda made it so we could spend channel points to vote
the music of okami will break the tie
there are 4 different artists for Okami, they can represent each game
idk what artist did this song
know what I love about power bounces btw
the fact that the 15th input missed doesnt count as "15 power bounces"
silly all or nothing rule I bet
Now no way there can be a tie
never seen the minish cap so I’m interested
I set myself up in such a way that I actually do 0 jump damage
cus I nerfed marios base 3 down to 0 with p down d up and the drain badges 🤣
JUST SO I DONT HAVE TO RUN AROUND EVERY COUPLE TRIES 🤣
and yet the stage ends up killing my spike goombas
phantom you have all my progression LUL
I need you to visit yoka 1 WWW door
like - not even kidding, the fact I now have collectively hit nearly 10 14s makes me mad
cus I really REALLY want my ttyd cheevo set done ;-;
an entire gameboy in TTYD! Amazing!
@Darkness3827 I mean there IS the mailboy SP
Successful surgery from Dad thanx doctors and a double stream by the besty phantom what a day.
you would not know if I can duplicate badges without a static badge somewhere, right?
Minish cap, more like rolling simulator
thinkin simplifiers if they even affect stuff past the 3rd
yo why can't gambling be like this in real life!?
Don't you mean fixed the machines
Again can't wait for Echoes in less than 3 weeks
Given its the Switch the rando for this should be quick to develop
yeah so once I get heat badge I am go mode cause my last item is aurora ticket in my victory road
I like legend hunt cause you can skip champion if you exclude the post game legends
need knuckle badge to use flash for regis, and need go google for regirock LUL
Those Who Inherit Out Will, Shine In The Middle.
Lmao my app still says okami
App is getting real shotty pichu
Well to be fair I don't like wind waker because you're always a kid
Link will have enough pastries to feed Zelda
Hello ! I hope you're doing well and you're having fun :D ❤️
I still haven't went past the swamp level..... I should really continue the game
Are you confident in this run ? DinoDance
blue key -> mailbag -> red key -> dolly -> Palace key
I believe in you, let's go randooo ! ❤️
Time to break the game in half
How long do minish cap randos usually take?
I never played minish cap. So this stuff is all foreign to me!
I know a lot of people love this title
Links Awakening is goated but cap is creeping
technically MMR could have that up to 16 hearts
I think BotW has that for master sword
just it got changed for accessibility logic side
@Jonxhas is that for secret shrine access when its locked?
secret shrine in vanilla has 4/8/12/16 hearts required for the Secret shrine miniboss doors in order of their dungeon order appearances yea
but as said, in Rando that requirement is bonked cus otherwise you'd have potential for seeds to be near full clear on health search alone for the garo master
not to mention that if you then forget about the final chest its another cycle reset and refighting them ALL for the final reward chest
ngl, at this point its more likely for me to get enough close calls from grinding power bounces that I will get to 100% dodge chance (ik it wont ever reach that as a number, but you get what I mean)
Might as well save twice just to make sure it saved
Did you know that you can roll through enemies?
bleedingblue and I are on different teams again in the mario party relay
it was wither blue or hahaphd LUL
teams werre decided with coin flips
dont you just hate coin flips?
Pokemon says FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version were released on this day in 2004 but all the replies are begging for it on switch LUL
25 years since the dreamcast launched...
GAH, of all the nights to be out late, it's the night Phantom streams Minish Cap
@buff00n i miss it too Sadge
I get it twitch Optimus prime gets his origins, Jesus fuck
3 times so far in a row
We had a cereal here that was like 5 years old
You've basically discovered a brown sugar brick LuL
A friend and I fucked around with a block of brown sugar
That divine instrument isn't as cool as infinity judge anyway
i got the persoan 3 reload dlc today but was force to buy the season pass and get shit idc about Madge
cant wait to use outfits and music idc about just to play the dlc
time to fuck with people more :D
Ngl when I beat the first half, I honestly thought the second half was just extra post game that was just more game
and rip everyone on that side of the bridge. Ammy just murdered them all
I mean look at it XD
Yes and I'll do it again
they didn't pray to ammy hard enough ig
The demi fiend did that and see where that got him
Jesus fuck I was so behind
I assume they mean get on the left wall to dodge the fight trigger?
yo, love this game, hope you’re doing good!
I’ve been MIA from twitch but tis a good thing, both jobs super busy 😆
ah yes the key item shop
Pretty sure you have to wait for him to land for galestorm to work on him.
just galestorm dude, blow up blocks, get to bottom, dig
got destroyed in DKC2 crowd control lol
(that's what issun calls her I'm not tryna be objectifying lmao)
I don't remember a fight trigger being there but maybe a cutscene trigger of issun bein like where's all this green stuff comin from?
moons can only be drawn one way lol
oh you can power slash it to make it go flat? I've always just leaned on it to aim it lmao
I think you were too close to the edge of the foot
idk what that was about lmao
how tf does she see us from there!?
love the "required" fight skips in this game, some are hilariously easy
Quit my job, guess I'm finally tired of night shift + the stupid people
It was temp job anyway so I don't feel bad
I think I'm good, just gotta put apps in
yeah I didn't know you could power slash them, I always used water spout
that's how you get out btw :P
hitting the uvula or whatever it's called
Hey issun does all the painting I think technically???
you can do this entire fight without slow time if your a total masochist.
and want it to take like 2 hours
I like how that's the end of the fight
fog pot ig is too many?
cause it does give you the ability to warp which I would think is useful
but yeah prolly wastes more time grinding for that
not being able to move camera in areas is the bane of so many ps2 era games
I think it's just the one outside of the city?
I don't remember there being one in the city but I might be totally wrong lol
Oh there is one in the city? Sei'an City: In a pond near Benkei's permanent fishing spot.
aristocratic quarter near the palace is what it says
for the weirdest cutscene in the game lmao
oh right digging part 3 NotLikeThis
you gotta equip an inkfinity before you enter
you've come just in time for the most bizarre cutscene of the game :P
Nah I didn't lol. Both attempts died in Ch5 and Ch4 respectively
I don't remember ever having this issue that's very bizare
you can just tackle/dig to do it inkless
yeah idk why you couldn't get between those blocks
also a lava pool in a wooden building seems... like a fire hazard...
i hope she knows how to get out tho
Which platform are you playing this on btw? Guessing Wii but had no idea how many this was on (nor what it was tbh)
original game was on PS2 then got ported to Wii, then got an HD release on well everything yeah.
yeah you got 2 more dungeons basically
or start of the ninetales dungeon
well you can't cause you only got 1 bag and you need it for the top :P
feed all creatures% run when? :P
yeah that's like halfway point iirc
in case you forgot a feedbag you have that :P
altho if you forgot a feedbag and a mermaid coin you're screwed
boy do I have a story for you. BK mode had me in an emerald mood so I rolled a seed today. GUESS WHO DIDNT TURN OF HIDDEN ITEMS!?!? I went to grab a rare candy and it was a berry phanto274D After that I rushed to lilycove for 3 quick hidden checks and it gave me fly opening ever grande. But I didnt wanna spend the evening doing HI checks so I quit after 3 hours LUL
I know the hidden item checks buts im not retracing everything again LUL
hope the jogging goes well tippiTap
wolf is well rested getting lots of good naps in
am about to sink another hour or so into power bounces, as much as I kinda am disgusted that I am putting practice into something I will most likely never ever do to that extent
cus I mean - as cool as 15 power bounces are, its a lot
the only way for it to have "value" is for when you dedicatedly want to jump a single wizzerd in the pit down cus of how every boss has hard power bounce caps
That is for a skill upgrade
oh it needs to be night time I think
cause you have to make the stars spin iirc
the sky changed to black maybe that's part of it?
do you need the extra skill? I don't think so cause it'd tell you to buy the Marlin rod if you did.
you have to talk to the watcher apparently
I mean water dragon is pretty long and ninetails dungeon is reeeeallly long
two digestions in 1 day, it's been rough for Ammy
ok I guess I lied when I said this was pretty long lmao
oh no something's happening but we got no clue what cause we're skipping all the exposition!
btw getting to oni island is timed just so you know so you might want to read ahead before you start that part
the punishment isn't really that much but it's worth noting.
I mean the timer is really lenient but given that you're going through reading you might run out of time.
rip Himiko & (presumably) Melons :(
Also I love how the time limit is "when the sun rises" WHEN YOU CAN CONTROL THE TIME OF DAY!
who needs fighting when you have the power of nuke!?
but yeah so if you fail to make it in time basically it becomes daytime and Issun is like we're too late! and it kicks you back to the entrance of N. Ryoshima Coast and then Issun is like "Actually we still got time! Nvm what I said about us being to late!" and then you can just run to her. I never tested if the time limit is still there once you've failed.
yeah I think you need to actually get inside to get to the mirror
so just like 1/3rd of the game left to go :D
I mean tbf the notes are very detailed. My notes would be like. go to place, fight dude, learn skill, use skill. It'd be like 3 pages and very useless to anyone tryna learn the game XD
phanto274GL on the seed.  Hopefully no random grottos screw you over
You managed to make it into brackets?
does the order on the sign mean anything?
I saw Noz was 1 spot out of qualifying :(
Yeah Zelda randos do be more wild on variance
such be the item placement per seed shenaniganry where silly stuff can happen
aww I was hoping the chests would be all bugs
poe is mad that it only landed on the lowest platform when it did the game
shutup game, Link isn't even that low health
I probably need to do some practice seeds but i've kinda just been doing speed run instead
oh that was 2nd clawshot lol
only 100 rupies... you're rich af I feel like Link deserves a bit more.
altho CitS is not minimal helmasaur
graveyard isn't considered part of the village?
I've gotten so use to doing fan skip i dont even inch up anymore lol
I just run the fuck up and do it
I dont even know how to do kai clip
stand on the closest patch of grass next to the door then just move slightly left is how i do it
I thought I saw someone do kai clip by DCS-ing to the fan that isn't moving
Does challenge cup have the brackets yet?
though its not posted or talked about in the offical discord
so I would assume literally no one is gonna see challenge cup stuff
To avoid needing a sword, I think you might be able to DCS to the fan. Feel like I saw that but idk
pretty sure you can just claw to the non moving part of the fan yeah
that sword has to be totally rotted
you can just block all links if you want
cant you make something along the lines of * viewers on * ?
oh that blocks clips that's lame
can you just block each turkish character individually?
I keep forgetting you learned ad on this game KEKW
@Darkness3827 also in itself not the best solution really
cus its more the specific use case right now then the character which is the issue
yeah but I mean how often are people gonna use turkish characters in here lol?
Twitch has been dumb about some of these updates
wanted to give you 100 bits somehow but this is the best emote I could come up with right now PrideLaugh
I'm like the fuck. Why even change it
MY GOD THOSE BOOTS ARE FUCKING LOUD
okay they're not actually that loud
but I just wanted to say that PrideLaugh
it's just when you're talking, they're like CLANGCLANGCLANGASDASKDUWHFEW
been in and out nice of u to double up again
this is 100% a rando I really need to learn though
the fast boots makes it a bit worse lol but even in vanilla they're loud af just not quite as spammy
GL on this rando and hilarious 😂 finish to minish
on a scale of 1-10, how good do you feel about the tourney soon
hope to see it on Friday:0
yeah I'll be done with my things by then
Lost my paper mario rando race because final bowser lueygaOops  but it was fun
How long did it take you to learn the TP rando?
Correction, the worst across multiple Zelda games
i was doing a quick test stream testing new mic and setup, i finally took my pc out of the closet
She was telling us how she is gonna crush you in the brazil tourny KEKW
even RACING phantom requires me to beat TUBAMAN
blacktiger needs gloves to get your cyberpass LUL it never ends
im assuming by the sigh that bugs are dead?
could be grosser - as a "pause" from doing the power bounce stuff I went and started the MM Masked Quest cheevo set c.c
guess what the missables include for first cycle
The path is double dommy Roddy Mommy
2k rupee grind on 0th cycle and guessing bomber code >.>
japan selling DS games in a 500 yen gacha machine meanwhile over here we pay 3 times retail
you should be able to time a jump slash as well
and make it before he hits you
it has to be at max momentum though
cuz you lose momentum after the first swing
yeah I dont like it either
its not very fun to route
I don't think many like snowpeak either
and its almost always dead meaning you have to do a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter
Even casuals don't like this dungeon
I like the theme of the dungeon and stuff, its just very fun to play
Some get confused on what to do with dark hammer
you either get to do 5 phases or 5 phases, good luck
feli do you wanna farm more rupees for me c.c
before ocarina of time, as deku, in pre clock town
ive heard masked quest is pretty bad
its overall rough around the edges
cool ideas? yea. some shit of it being fucked? sure
but to have a cheevo be like "farm 2k rupees in oth cycle"
or better "guess bombers code on day 1 without ocarina in inventory"
Dungeon worthless other than Dark Hammer area
it always has late sphere stuff
The only mercy this dungeon had in the seed
oh did you decide to do the other tourney
i just kinda said no, then got a ping later when i "hadn't responded" and beest pinged me saying "The. is glubbers"
At least we have boomerang for this seed
at that point just finish reverse city tho
okay that's infinitely more fair if you had no rang
you can just do a targeted LJA for this
you can make it that with jump slash
you want the boomerang to align with the corner edge
If you free throw it, you can align with the red baba enemy, then aim up some, and get it out ASAP
targeting the red baba works too I suppose
the game doesn't let you jump off the cliffs
you have to side hop or jump slash
there's only like 1 specific angle where you can hop off the cliff
i don't doubt that, just saying the game doesn't like when you try to
Certain ledges are coded to prevent jumps in this dungeon
from the spots you tried are the ones that dont let you jump
is that the first logical bomb bag
cuz they're the items with the least requirements throughout the game
boomerang just happens to be less useful overall
fun fact, that kargorok, kork, was named kork because someone meant to call him "kirk" and misspoke and that's what got immortalized
a low 4 hour time for huh
Too many hard tricks is why I gave up on trying to speedrun TP lol
@isaac_twpr im running glitchless to avoid those while I learn
Took me 5 days to finish the route and stopped after that lol
cuz if I dont like speed running it in the first place why would I wanna learn the harder stuff
Yoooo im late but hows the run?
Casino Spinner, I assume it was somewhere in like Kak Gorge?
Lmao thats basically the same thing XD
what do you mean by casino?
Aweh, I wanted to see the cool slash technique and not just bombs
if you just aim the arrow he'll hit you and blow it up
thats usually how I deal with them
alternatively you cant hit them when you're facing them, so you can also just turn around and spin attack
Omg that's classic, just let them do the work for you
thats actually how I do tot room 2
bomb arrow the armos then hold a bomb arrow and all 5 lizalfos die instantly
DoritosChip quite a few of those
i mean yeah there's few seeds you wont have atleast 2
but I think its good to know other methods just incase
so I tend to explore stuff
Yeah, stuff like that can really screw someone over
Few top players did asyncs so people got a ton of points off of those
its alright I personally think your gonna win CC
btw the 1 item you hinted you need to get blue rock smash before i can get it
i need keys and 3 items YEP
the other items you hinted idk what dungeon it in since i have ER on
Have a good night everyone! phanto274Wave
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
have you tried agatha's lock picking service?
Why is there a fucking factory in basically old Japan
Why would you lie on Twitter?
What in the world was that
I think the wood ceiling was slightly in the way so it spawned behind
is this ad break timer new
Darkness I got a question for ya
I wonder what new animal gods they'll make for an Ōkami sequel
@AnniLyn2 cause uh... i forget the next line of the song D:
@Ohrocks Well technically there is a sequel but I never played it so idk what it's like
No, it's like drizzling and windy
Shit weaker than a drink from Fridays
pretty sure the devs don't either
pretty sure they said it's a spiritual successor not a true sequel
That's shit is a fake sequel, but it's still a good game
I'm a lightweight and I've had 3 drinks from Fridays and felt 100% sober lmao
You may feel sober...but that doesn't mean you are
I'm 36 years old, and from New Orleans. I know what being drunk is lmfao
Dude...I'm 28 from Florida growing up with alcoholics
Not sure where I mentioned a drink off?
I wouldn't accept because I barely drink, even in social environments
I actually can't anymore though...was suppose to be a funny. Trying to slow down
Honestly blue...I'm tired af and just talking like an idiot
yeah the stealth eye behind you lol
ooh time for the best character in the game I think? or did you already meet him?
8th race there's that many? geez lol
yeah there aren't that many required blockheads
Dad was supposed to come home today but will spend extra day.
yeah this area is really cool but also really empty lol
Hey Phantom! How's the speedwalk going?
I still need to play this game, it's in my backlog, but it's also been in my backlog for years LUL
Amazing game from what I've seen
Yeah, but the glitch run is also not super combat heavy iirc. Whenever Auride was running this game I would watch
Do you do the lava jump skip in this route?
yeah there's a lot of that in this game
apple doesn't fall far from the tree :P
man I remember still playing this for the first time. I was really floored by the painting concept
RAR im here to annoy u till i pass outttt
tippiLurk gl with the route runthrough finish
her scream warps the clothes back to her
at least Nagi's sword isn't made of wood lmao
Okay now everything's back to normal unlike that weird ass shinshu with no water or left half
second verse same as the first
she knows the forest so she can just warp us through it
yeah this is the final dungeon then boss rush
Since when did this become persona dungeons
This is awkwardly similar to spr
i really gotta play this game more lol
it is a neat game feli
final skill of the game :(
ive played the first hour or so of the game a couple times but always get distracted by something else and never play more lmao
yeah the beginning is a bit slow lol but it's one of my fav games ever it's so unique and gorgeous.
yeah that's how I always did it but you're supposed to use slow time lol
I like how the constellations get progressively more difficult
ranking of the constellation cutscenes? :P
a fire spider freezes u makes sense
phantom did you enjoy my majoras mask fan art
once you freeze one you can use it to freeze the other, saves like .1 seconds of moving the brush :P
I thought you were supposed to use ice for these
when you don't spam exorcism slips
Reminds me of early Falcon Dive
WHAT THE CAR is sooooooooooo gooooooooood!!!!!
I was doing a bit of speed routing at the very end, so figured why not continue the theme
i pressed snooze on the ad pop up, did that turn off ads for 5 minutes lmfao
yeah, snooze delays ads by 5 minutes
i never set up ads on my channel so idk how they work lmfao
am a nonbinary retro enthusiast myself!
I was playing tetris on a real super game boy accessory!
it's supposed to be an asterisk shape for icestorm btw that's prolly why it wasn't working super well.
ig cause that's faster but that's def not the intended shape lol
but they don't have the power of nuke!
awsm explosion and way to go out
you prolly don't have time for this lol but it looks really creepy if you try to go to any of the other areas of the game during the day of darkness lol. I never noticed till I was just testing rando stuff.
o7 Issun, you were a bro
no exorcism slips allowed category when? XD
lechku and nechku don't get a refight how tragic :(
I mean you just fought Orochi too and that was already a refight itself :P
time to fight it while it has 0 HP the whole time too XD
I thought it was like 5 or 6 lmao
ig the beginning doesn't really count as a phase
I think 20 is already enough for this fight LUL
I think you need 6 or 7 for this fight.
now you can buy so many exorcism slips for  NG+!!!
Now imagine if that was your standard Shibe or Akita Inu
beat the whole game in 3 IGT weeks
YAY NOW YOU CAN DO KT GLITCH!
well you can't since it was patched
no we wont save and be heartbroken
Also managed to finish new style chicken rice, lap cheung sausages, beansprouts and cabbage all in one rice cooker
Hopefully no bad RNG casino hunts
from wolf Zelda to half-wolf zelda :P
no way another double stream Wowzahs
this song sounds like it should be the theme to a 70s comedy show lol
@darkness3827 "we need a beast right now to keep the rest at bay"
I was thinking about doing this today
phanto274GL on the seed.  Again praying for good RNG
what do you mean by casino in a tp rando context?
And no hints for the item
You know what's fun? Looking for rods
thx for the war funds, ashei
@AnniLyn2 does the bot ever NOT talk nonsense? LUL
@darkness3827 it did one time...I think
Made too much rice this time because of all the veggies
And the rice came out a lot fluffier too
Can make rice and eggs :3
Bow and bomb bag would be nice too
I cannot count how many times I've fallen off something because of a poe
Almost 2 weeks away for Echoes of Wisdom
Not bad, faster bomb bag this time
I have never watched TP rando, this is great
Welcome to the club Lewis evo17Hiyo
When the signs start repeating... it's that the moment of "okay nothing new anymore"?
I only have a few paper mario randos on YouTube to watch. I’m sad. lol
So the co op me and rain did. He paused and said the 3 fangirls the 3 goddesses
Red blue and green.  I just went holy shit
For what I've heard people enjoy it
But that's like, every speed game lmao
the level of player at work has gone up. There's a competition for NWC:NES tomorrow and top 6 times qualified. I came in 5th for qualifying O_O
and first had like 5 seconds on me
he went back to his original group if you didn't know
Was gonna say you got the arrows for it lolz
I think he got sick of being the libcurl guy
I heard "there's not much porn"
If you didn't say in temple of time... that would've been forever in my head
So ToT did hold a vanillish Master Sword
that's quite the amazon wishlist, bot
Hook, Claw and boomerang is all we need for go?
So, how's the seed. Can we thank Issac?
Seed seems okay, but who knows
Seems good so far... which is sus
We all know when items show too fast... it starts being annoying
i didnt realize you could quick transform in the water
Gonna head out for a bit
how do you lose a bike
Kinda surprised Damn 4th Chaos Emerald ain't on there
Or the "Taking candy from a baby line"
yooo I came in to the best item
Boomerang locked behind a casino dommy Roddy Mommy
Church of the Mortal Draw again?
@stavros12c34anenoglou run enough any% and you'll love him or hate him, literally
So basically all dungeons were dead aside from the one hidden skill and the swords
It was... so snow would make sense
Will this be an all 7 hidden skills seed
well one is locked behind the church which Phantom prolly won't get
Have you ever exited that grotto from the jumps?
I would be scared every time I go to that one
At least this time dark hammer won't be as much of an issue as last seed
So close to jumping in water damn man
What was who what when where?
is there a grotto in this game that isn't awful? lmao
If that's not an acceptable answer then shellblade. Just drop water bombs
Quick spin skills I'm jelly of
it's funny how fast boots/ball basically negate ice physics
idk like at least rank 20, @PhantomGamesBot
Dude had a bomb up his ass
Couldn't be yesterday's seed where this check had 2 important items
This boss intro is such a mood whiplash
If it's the rang... then wind is the meaning
He didn't make noise when yeto hit him
yeta is not looking into his eyes, she's looking into the camera :P
Rain: so what they're saying is happiness CAN be bought
That's not hurricane... was a little baby storm then
Nah I just live far enough away from the major part of it
it was a tropical depression cause that hurricane gotta be depressed af that it couldn't do shit to you.
Time for worst check in the game
Category 2 hit the coast, so it was pretty bad for them.
Got the edge of the storm and not in the eye of the tiger?
Ye. We're on the southern side of it now, so it's no rain, just windy
But the fact that I have power is great
Poor friend 5 minutes up the road has no power
Star 2 is heart piece yeah?
Oh wait...shit thought you already did forest temple lolz
Barren dungeons because you like that
I had no one this watch this morning so I did your tp vod from yesterday, I'll prob do that tomorrow too lol
well im off to watch movie , have a good rest of race!
If you fight ook you can have a fast Ganon lol
Wait...red chu helps as a replacement???
Th3n you could have an even faster Ganon fight
Time to get diababa out of the way and onto the dorf
Rain flicked me for making a count Dracula joke
I say go for claw route
It does the same when I try to follow your lja tips
Surprise seed after this one? phanto274ColonD
easy mode hell sounds pretty nice tbh
Where's the plead gif when you need it lolz
This was a good seed in all honesty
Yeah it wasn't evil like the last one
How do you like... go through him so quickly in 1v1?
I figured it was because of the jump attack and then quick spin but it doesn't help
between the legs bomb arrow lmao
Omg I gotta see how that works work ganon xD just shoot bomb arrow between his legs
Oh okay... I'll have to practice that then
That horse should be... gone for that
I like...stared at what you meant but man that looks difficult
I wake up to a gg nice
At least it was better than the last few you've done
TP Link is animated like a dork
Bye YouTube! Like com and sub!
I'm telling you guys...quick items makes the gameplay be sus
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day

I’m going to read till this starts
Cheer100 shadow: jeesus criest (silence) kilogram
Cheer100 glados: bing bjorn glados: eyaa eyee eyoo
so many of my notes are adam now I need to document more of maths bullshit
Phantom did you know if you win the beaver race in majoras mask the game softlocks?
By the river's bend, where beavers race, A glitch occurs, a puzzling case. With tails a-twitch and paws a-sprint, The game’s softlocked; there's no hint.  Sprites are frozen, progress stalled, In pixel chaos, players called. What should be joy turns into strain, As racing beavers halt the game.  In this digital maze, where codes collide, The beaver race becomes a bumpy ride. A playful glitch in a game’s grand scheme, Turns racing fun into a frozen dream. Cheer100

On the twelfth seed of season 3 my seed gave to me... 12 traps from chests, 11 shrooms from Cheato, 10 useless badges, 9 gifts for Koot, 8 FP power bomb, 7 dungeons shuffled, 6 Jr fights, 5 golden lil oinks, 4 stunlocking koopas, 3 blooper fights, 2 ice palace visits, and a goombario making ultra rank!! Cheer100
Might be a bit too harsh to headphone users
Not sure...I just know I can't
Probably surprise noise will scare me awake
I think it's more harsh to non headphone users because there is just a screaming man blasting out of a speaker
The race was good in bits... how'd the whole thing feel?
yeah, I didnt watch it yet
Planning on 4 dungeons tonight... really wish I had the guts to stream it lolz
Nooo I do but I'm also scared lolz
Phan you know someone named terra?
Shit... didn't think that far evo17Flip
Come on Bow save us from this nightmare
I ran into him playing tp vanilla... he said he was playing all zelda games
Would you remind me, is all of sewers in logic regardless of which chapters you have?
Terra Guild... that's his name on YT
Hello we can do chapter 5
Do you know, if I watch YouTube videos in 2x soeed,.do you still get tmcredit for all the time? If I'm watching, I want the time to count
Oh need hammer upgrades for that
@Rgamer0 you cant go to the bos without
come on hammer where are you
Probably in the billion checks of chapter 4
my game place got a copy of path of radience... 200 big ones lol
Boots and a turtle on a cloud
never played them but toally could now
Will you play one just for the hell of it?
I did watch the anime as a kid so do have some exposure
didnt know there were 3 games
Never heard of that. What is it?
why not just call it 3?
This is the station I was hoping Blue was
played Viewtiful Joe on a demo disc and didn't care for it
then again, young buff00n was VERY ignorant
i got stuck on chapter 5 or 6 and never beat it
I remember it but also don't
there's a lotta video games / series with potential that Capcom murked. Sadly.
the shop got a copy of V Joe too
Not much remains for go huh
just chuck the seeds into the soil, I see
Maximilian Dood had a little segment on CNN talking about marvel vs capcom. The limelines finally lined up
at least levels shouldn't be a problem ... hello and good luck of course chrisYo
Who is your least favorite boss? Because I hate General Guy.
on your tracker, do you have frying pan or not? it's hard to see, leaning to yes
time to ask the devs to change it's color ... 😅
you forgot the golden piggy check
no kooper and no bombette when you have chapter 1 ... yikes
5 life shrooms? so high on life
8bitdo is releasing a blutooth GCN controller mod kit
if its not too difficult to explain: how is Artifact in logic but Lyrics isn't when Chapter 2 doesn't need to be completed?
I would only do this to play pape on emu for AP but it still aint worth it to me
its a fair question to ask
don't tell me Rosie has something 💀
I hate her ever since she had Koopa Legends and Crystal Berry was in Peach's Castle
It was that one spot again
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
I never check crystal berry. If Rosie has progression im DNFing
That spot is nothing but tears
@Rgamer0 ok but talk to me about losing 30 minutes not realizing upgrade block outside of chapter 7 not counting as chapter 7
rosi is ok i think when you doit after beting you can esey home shroom but enoing that you need to go ther
mayby is it in chapter one
calling it now the key will be in red station that you need kooper to get
wouldn't surprise me if koopa fortress key is behind the bridge on the road towards koopa fortress
69 players earned Concord’s Platinum trophy before the game was taken offline via PSNProfiles
but wee ned to wait no bsg is a race or not and the end
also hope that ttyd was treatin ya well?
you mean cus of the missable or?
eh - I went pretty overkill on that one
I was at like lv28 or somethin with WAY too much FP BP and like 30HP
isn't amazee dazyee guaranteed on one floor?
is super blooper the only boss enemy whose minions don't die when you kill the main boss?
you got better odds then in ch4 but you still are rolling dice
to be fair? you also evaded a lot of wizzerds
yeaaa but I personally would rather get bob ulks and an amazy or swoopulas and amazees PrideLaugh
Valkyria Chronicles getting a pysical version on switch by limited run... I really really want that lol
cus then you can heal w items if you dont level from blasting them w fire drive
anyhow: rogh that the pit treated ya like that for sure
but also you goin that deep within the nerfs applied => you got this for sure
Ok, I think it's the screaming shy guys. They get under my skin
hell - another thing you could do is look through the enemy farm tables for pretty luckies
I kinda omega cheesed it given I had what, 60BP? and then 30/35 for HP/FP
and brought extra boo capes and shit
I went to 50 right after ch1 given I wanted that right away
didnt want to backtrack lots between chapters cleaning my inventory
and it trivialized things like ch6 missable
and since I am a gremlin, I knew roughly what phantom was doin cus I am derpy
honestly even say "dont use star power except for floor 100"
cus its a war of atrition with bonetail as it is
7 if you got both damage dodges on
I was quite lucky given I just blocked every single breath
and caped mario / partner right when need be for a bit of extra while keeping fire drive bonus trickles going
not even kidding - fire drive was a perma equip for me near quake hammer as shit as both are with their relatively static damage and falloff of them
did tippi rage quit her stream earlier? I zonked out to sleep off this sickness i have
@stavros12c34anenoglou nahh, pb by 20min tippiTap
damn i been gone for awhile and missed the whole seed Sadge
what is your badge equip rn if I am allowed the curiosity? in ttyd I mean and ofc also only if you renember
I didnt give the power to my partners - in hindsight that made them quite shit tippiGiggle
but I had defend plusses and damage dodges going
then obv. I mentioned quake and fire drive, quake as a low cost bomb to damage control flip shit
get a couple extra encounters up on the moon while you're up there, given they should be free
quake wasnt a pit badge anyway was it
Are you allowed 12 power rush badges? That's the only way I got through
@grover53 for the cheevo no last stands, close calls, power rushes or mega rushes
nothing which would be a "while in danger"
or 3 if you're stupid like I was tippiGiggle
I am at best, a beginner. But I have some strats from watching streamers for years
cus I mean - again, no p plusses for my partners, I tattled everything on my way down
also sucks that bonetail has a soft powerbounce cap at like 5 or 6
meaning you cant just no 1framer through that i 1 turn
you kinda get cut off harshly
which was rather hilarious for me to learn cus I am pretty certain I hit that cap everytime with mario PrideLaugh
what you COULD in theory do is try to charge up a LOT
the problem there being the amount of boo capes you'd have to bring just for bone tail alone
not to mention preferably all 7 partners at ultra for sacking
cus at 2 pplusses, jump man, maybe all or nothing + ultra boots you're at 7 -1 for the defense on bonetail if I got the math right for base
and then charge is +2 per trn
do your math against the softcap for how many charges and boo capes that is to evade the breath just nullifying your charge (think at least bonetail was able to do that?)
Well you weren't kidding with short
could be wrong on that charge reset through bone tail
in fact I wouldnt even be surprised if I was wrong
anyhow - didnt do power bounce prac either yesterday or today, was doing RRT for cheevos PrideFlower
finally commiting to grinding my starter to 90 and such, recruiting a bunch
would still be the 15 yea
I had like over 10 14s
so I definitely got the skill for it
I just need to stop fuckin up that last input KEKW
cus you need 15 success ful inputs, not 15 bounces
not even kidding - if I could convert my save from US to PAL, I'd immediately dump PAL for that
and its quite a stinger on the cheevo discussion to read people say "oh yea its free just play the game with power bounce everywhere" when you then see them at PAL 50
meanwhile I have hit 14 on US
tippiGiggle not shitting, I actually tried that
cus you know that funny percentage slider?
you know - for core speed?
yea it doesnt cut you out connection wise if you go down to like 10%
but it did not help cutting the frames down to that cus frame skips KEKW
also the audio gets HILARIOUSLY crunchy if you do it
so I just keep it back at 110 which is what I renember ppl saying is allowed for say MMR or WWR racing
and not set it any higher or lower cus its fluid, doesnt give issues, works
A season 3 seed with a chapter 4 mandatory going well
Now if no chapter 4 is when you start to panic
do you? I hear the more dense a locale the more harsh it can be on having like one item being a pain in the butt
*looks at MM with the clock town / termina field density no one really skips because there's just waaay too much sphere 0 in there*
so just yours, not the restream
You want heavy dense checks in these settings because a lot of checks are replaced by coins
you could keep it at very low volume
yeah, thats why I didnt watch the restream lol
while also peekin options in routing mayhaps
just was thinking cus thats like the prime time of watching a rando race match between 2 on a multi - seeing both people routing, their decision making to gameplay
obviously also makes a HUGE difference if you got people with 3digit seed totals or more insane counts then "just 3digits" under their belt
like - MMR ppl from what I heard went crazy enough to bulk gen seeds purely so that they'd be able to gauge chances of item placement by spoiler log eval
with like %ages per check in how ikely it is to have a sphere 0, all that shit
cus any RNG placement algo you can come up with will find ways to roll somewhat silly endresults in hindsight
I like to ramble on, especially when I am eating dinner
my only crux would be it being the windows mediaplayer thing over vlc but like - what can ya do
am quite happy I didnt get ASMR McDeez'd again
cus MAN that particular ad just SUUUUUCKS
imagine ppl goin soft pron on you over shitty ass McDeez burgers
no clue who either approved it or thought that that sells
very lucky for a Friday the 13th seed lmao
pretty free set logic speakin holy
like - as much as snowpeak can be a shitty dip / early to late dungeon thing, it overall doesnt need much to be beaten
i missed the first 1:30 what were hints?
I sooo feel that claw grip
joystick + buttons while single hand typing hard
big recommend to 1hand type while mashing tippiGiggle
you said they DNF'd? how far were they?
and most likely other bomb bags also locked by that one bomb bag
if I got that wrong obv. correct me on that knowledge depth peek
but I'd guess path is like woth => woth bomb bag is locking all other bomb bags minimum
and given you cant underwater chest without boots, also therefore ball and chain behind smashables to irons
thats a HUGE path hint holy
bomb > boots & woods > argorok
woods sound like clawshot to me
only grove ped, grotto, past entrance for grove then?
or is the past pre ToT bit not grove?
the pain of rolls from momentum
lots of cash for kak shopping though
I coulda seen pulling a soft orphan on these 2 and coming from bridge area after going for the woods knowledge
bow woulda stung for sure being on a soft orphan though
so that cost you like a minute altho you did get a poe out of it
dunno - can you still iSG in that version or nah?
cus its definitely more "walls try to be walls" then base OoT would be
ye they patched it back in
chat, do I make an omelet, or eggs on toast
i was gonna ask how it ended up going but i guess i can also just watch and see LUL
you could get isg in vanilla oot 3d but it was dumb and you cant do anything with it
yeah i forgot about the race so i missed it
is it out of logic to do that chest without lantern?
so funnel fed to doing the more annoying sphere 0s which are also less in number with the barrens
back then 10 dollars was a LOT
bug, double clawshot, clawshot + spinner
which come to think IF bugs have something that snail from farron woods is smellin
is that the first west chest?
1st chest in vanilla prog path
not counting the 2 underwater refill ones right at the start
was that the 3rd path to fyrus hint?
but im bad at rememberring hints
3 per single path sounds like a lot to me - given I am fed the 1 repeat per hint from MMR / OoTR
with either 1 or both placed logically and shit
south castle was path to what again?
also free peek of the past bug
shows how much I know the settings tippiGiggle
sooo potential double domrod or domrod bait
which for this check isnt the worst
you get up to ook with what you got rn right?
btw, the spiders on that ivy there can be reached with wolf link
smol speedup one could apply to this check this way would be poking the bomb again no?
or do explosives in this not blow up when hit by bow?
very silly d boost nonsense obviously
couldnt the bomb be carried to the web there getting the water alcove chest?
clean out sphere 0 => never bad
you can do that axl but its a bit annoying to do
cus you gotta get the pick up for it
I mean - you definitely can do it rangless
if you really felt like it KEKW
but yea rather certain you can do that walk with pick up rangless, its just annoying as shit to do
cus you are on a very tight window
today I got my dog a mini volleyball and when I toss it to her she hits it back to me axlsrPat
I spent WAY too long tryin to fish a bomb fish for the cheevo set in this one KEKW
well that extends the OoL path guessing
cus this confirms its either a clawshot lock or it is the double domrod
by means of then double clawshot
I am favor of skipping ordon and waiting on the goats/bo hint
the check being some deez nuts, truly a gottem moment of the seed tippiAFirret
not necessarily where I would have taken them first tippiGiggle but definitely a place
grove grotto is a "now in logic" for prog thing in my books, aside of iza
I'd honestly put money on grove grotto purely cus its in logic prog
still OoL for you as well
like - deeep chain this, and its not done
im expec ting bombs to lead to something else and that leads to boots
Oh...shit I thought you were playing a new one for a second xD
how much does that open in FT?
i like helmosaur when "I'm" not playing LUL
I wanna say grov grotto has your irons then? cus there's SO much OoL access for checks rn
and then 2nd rod in GM
cus like - logical access to checks v illogical is currently BIG difference
did you do out of logic dcs in south CT
it was only domrod there with past being nothing
correct me if I am silly on this: logical speak you "really only" got grove grotto right now right?
ohh cus it was on the hands in lanayru outside spring?
bombs -> boots (found rang on it)
you got path to argorok with a domrod -> rang
and south castle town to fyrus with a domrod
technically the argorok bit is fullfilled with domrods -> spinner -> clawshot
the fyrus bit is open and so is the boots bit still
I learned something last seed I played
I would make a joke about that, but it's pretty inappropriate. alpham40LEMON
so when you clawshot the vines to enter the east side you normally have the moneky cutscene. But if you clawshot far enough to the right the scene wont trigger
the fact you didnt get a 2nd damage push surprises me a bit KEKW
what a key ring this gave out hooly
and throw boomberang 3 times to open door
(me - I would cus I kinda always put mistrust to Gamecube zelda savescums)
i heard resetting during saving is bad for gamecube so I dont do that
so for the paths we got bomb -> Boots (with help of double dom rod to rang to boots in FT), FW to Argorok (DomRod, possibly fullfilled by Spinner -> clawshot ), South Castle Town to Fyrus (DomRod to Rang to Boots)
I would think sketch would be an option of being important which would be streamlined
I know youve down WW rando a few times, whats your opinion of it?
yeaa you just chase GM from here
ww rando is hard sail locked
WWR has like 140 ish on what I saw being race mode settings a couple years back
thats prob why people keep asking to cut grottos for TPR
"oh lets race a game where we dont play the game"
not knocking but it rly sounds lame
not much variety in what you have to depuzzle
ppl go crazy with storage superswims and shit
its what makes me actively not care much about WWR racing rly
"why race glitchless logic seeds with all glitches allowed"
its like saying "okay lets bake cookies but we have them already so lets not"
never can get on them straight away KEKW
link is afraid of heights lol
I hate it when that happens
Seeing the action but still holding direction
I can see why you would miss the clawshot from west to north field on the spinner bit
crazy how link can hold the master sword while magnetized LUL
cus like - yea its hinted in a way
but this cawshot also fulfills both domrods
and if you get lantern late cus you got no clawshots
you would not get to getting domrod completed
why is 3rd small key needed?
cus it can be before or after
we have the boss key tho
in this case not needed for a raw finish
so what I wanna say given the placement of items?
that medium deep fried OoL chain checking brought more results then it could have depending
kinda blessed that it fell in place like that
like - thats an item placement thing which happened to me tippiTap
as much as obv. the game skill plays a roll in how quick the checks happen tippiTap
this spits you out at kak right?
the one on DMT is too far out then to grab a true jelly
there's no good line up, closest really is the DMT one
if you wanted it that is
I love having a GBA with a backlit screen phanto274Mash
cus the more annoying side of the dungeon on checks is then dedge
come to think - gremlin question
you wouldnt know why for zeldas, I dont use maptrackers for the cheevos to know I did shit? KEKW
thats a line I didnt know existed in where one can go
playing vanilla Ruby, I named Torchic TABASCO lol
i didnt wanna use teriyaki again, I wanted something new
if ever there was a jet seed
granted - the dungeons I bet didnt hold your opponent then
it rly musta been the paths with domrods each I feel like
you'd still go and peek though I feel like
if you are in the position of thinkin both domrods are fullfilled paths
which they have been involved in all 3 paths
so there's that inkling to my brain of "surely its DONE now right? no more? path is done? SURELY!"
its very strong that its tied to the domrods and bomb bag to rang
or am I silly in that regard
and definitely all went through the domrods
which were your only path items really from the 2 path to boss paths
either way you turn it those domrods 100% ended up fulfilling all 3 paths with items needed for prog behind
and there's a decent bit where one can say "oh yea its done" given what all was behind them
so for me coming from MMR in my skewed view on how the path hints here would work out, you would have to decide when to stop chasing chain potential on the woth / path over progressing and falling back to density
sub2hr finish, if not ganon pulled some shit
it would make sense as it is
cus to me, the desert is one big region
thats too much 4d chess for my brain PrideLaugh
like - I think I get what you mean
but also like - thats too deep for me tippiGiggle
that armor trolled many rang throws
in the last 5 minutes my zigzagoon found a nugget and a revive lol
or was 3rd gen not like that with items from pick up?
its 3rd gen using pick up
what I was asking is if pick up was just random there or whether level mattered for which items you can get
you are playing ruby right axl?
yeah im playing ruby. In emerald the nugget is a 1%
in emerald is when levels start to matter
ruby / sapphire have a flat %age chart of items
yea dorf fights are rly just execution
did you clanker finish for memes though tippiTap
thats the big silly bogus question
cant wait to see you do the restream with Pocky LUL
Was going to ask if you wanted to race KEKW
But I think doing a second match is not right timing
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
come back i just got here
BBQ chicken and Paper Mario. It's a good day.
what happens if you try to first when someone already has?
Just won't let you redeem it
the guy you hung out with last night is he the one that locked himself out?
is this a league race or just for fun?
Oooh not to late for race start \o/
being able to check panels this early is nice
i tried to see your stream yesterday but you literally ended stream 2 seconds after i showed up
he did another one with orange
I'm participating in the weekly so I'm good to go after that
Put the child back where you found him
Idk why they always make so much because nobody eats the leftovers and it goes bad
yay! let me make a teleportation device. ill be back in 20 years lol
guess it's time to clear ruins lmao
oh right other stones i forgot
ig that's why it's miracle water, cause it's a miracle it's in here
@darkness3827 I just read your message and I can’t help but laugh
If you find miracle water in the desert...you're in a mirage
@AnniLyn2 What if you find it in the oasis?
still catching up on season 3 races on YT. any notable trick changes?
Upgrade block in Flower Fields tho
Cake when 4 isn't needed is weird to see
dang megapaul AND rigby? seems unfair to 2v1 🤔
Dude when it comes to checks in general...I always exclude the Lanayru Ice Block Puzzle in TP...that puzzle is annoying af
Makes me want to strangle a turtle (not actually)
i do wonder how many races this season where forgotten panels end up winning. we need that stat LUL
Paper Mario and DK64 races are always fun to watch.
dk64 is also such a wild game
Will you ever join a dk64 race Phan?
@langepon especially with the season 3 settings
I have no idea about the races tbh but I can imagine
it's just that I played the original a lot and never 100%ed it
You shouldn't say that about blue bananas
With season 3 settings you start with keys 1 and 3, two Kongs and three random moves. Levels are shuffled. You have to do two Kongs stuff in Helm and three stages of the K.Rool fight.
how long does a run take on average
All the runs I've watched have been under 3 hours. A lot of them under two hours.
Love how you dropped down like meh
Bot sometimes you make sense but in the end...don't
Also, with season e settings, the fries are randomized to be anything,  melon crates can have items, and the jetpack mini game may have an item. They've been a blast to watch.
I typed faries and it came out as fries smh
the cat fell asleep on the couch, now I can't get comfy on it noooooo
You gotta sit on the floor
there's a draft on the floor
I have a big bean bag chair
I threw mine away last year to make space
they're cool but also kinda big
I need to wash the cover the cats take it over when I’m not sitting in it
Oh man lang...bad but also good idea
@AngelLove94 ah yeah, the hairy dimension
You got hair and claw marks and fights over it lolz
this is memory foam filled so no claw marks thank goodness
I'm off to bed, gnight gnight and gl with the race
yes made it for the race
also covid makeseverything taste like puke
@stavros12c34anenoglou hope you feel better soon
you can tell it's a girl star because she has a pink bow on her head
When turtle on a cloud is go mode
i cant believe that was french vanilla
did rigby start late his stream is like 20 minutes behind
oh lol i didn't notice megapaul in the title my bad
yea 1 fight at a time
phantom shoulda done both simultaneously :P
this check is so much fun
How did Lacky get stuck in a tree
dirt + bean + water = boss fight
Mario gonna be a floaty boi
this is definitely one of the strats ever
i have no spoilers to give, so that works, lol
why does junior actually suck today
twas good! beekah's going through three houses for the first time
watt is the savior with upgrades
i gtg cuz i'm grabbing dinner with the fam, but i wish you luck on the rando races!
yeah that sounds like a nightmare
@Weegee666 yeah basically instead of upgrade blocks the upgrades are shuffled into the item pool and the upgrade blocks are now item blocks.
Save! My poor heart screams sa e!
Jr. Troopa was tired of your bullying throughout the game and wanted revenge.
Ok.  I've been watching without sound. Sorry for being dramatic
is it possible to make the validation check an upgrade block if there’s a partner able to upgraded?
it’s the hardest part of the settings not gonna lie
petition to alter that setting phanto274Smile
we going on empty gas folks
the end game is just not good
hopefully the next one is better
this has got me on the edge of my seat
I won, but at what cost?
paul is in an unwinnable vs Hallway
time for a stretch break before the next one
I mightve missed most of it if it frustrated you in the end
I'm asking Rigby if we can remove partner shuffle upgrade KEKW
Genuine question, what's the difference between having a non-upgraded Watt in these settings vs not getting Watt at all? I know it's rare you don't get Watt but she can be not logically required
rng strats, time to pick up lucky day and close call lmao
Cut it close but yes it did
surprised you never put on D-Down Smash
so in this case, mega shock would have been better for junior
the practice seed where you had ultra ranked watt but no watt and unranked parakarry was so tragic :(
but yeah another fun no chapter 4 seed :(
Well hope you don't mind, imma lull meself to sleep before work watching the 2nd race
You mean no fun allowed no Chapter 4 seed
this seed sucked, partner upgrade shuffle makes life harder than it needs to be
@Rgamer0 yeah the shy guys steal all the fun and you can't get it back if you never defeat them :P
I think it was something for ch3?
The opposite problem to George of the Jungle
What did chapter 7 shop have
I know it wasn't in logic
watt upgrades were prolly in chapter 4, cause that's where all good things go to die
sleepy sheep bowser to death :P
hmm.... there were more life shrooms there but still
yeah chapter 2 shop also had life shrooms
and 5 coins cheaper in chapter 2!
Makes you wonder if what you had access to if early Toy Box had something good like a boots upgrade
you should check what was in toy box yeah
$10 both watt upgrades were in toy box
literally most things that would have helped were here
yeah that woulda prolly saved like 10 min from final fights lmao
Okay seems like a non required 4 should be cleared if you're looking for stuff still
is this the new strat if we're low on items
always dip Toy Box, that's the S3 strat
yeah it's prolly more like if you're about to go to bowser and can tell it's gonna be difficult it might be worth dipping.
out of logic dips are always great to see what they might have
for us viewers at least lol
when does the next race start
apparently you needed power rush and power plus to not struggle
It was similar to yours in terms of no upgrades
Rigby also had no upgrade Watt
Fp costs were pretty good so it wasnt too bad
Power plus and rush from a non req ch 5 dip helped a ton though
so.... when are we removing partner upgrade shuffle Rigby KEKW
So non required 4 and 5 are worth dipping huh
this song is good it’s a head bopper
yeah I feel like dipping non-required areas is only really if you feel super weak.
doing it early just seems like a waste of time more often than not.
i kinda miss 7  chapter races still but i know they'll probably never come back lol
7 chapters with hints that'd be the dream
7 chapters glitched logic would be pretty short lol
or i guess unrestricted not glitched logic
how would you make 7 chapter faster? other than no keysanity? :P
@Darkness3827 maybe all partners useable or something
i've played it on once like 2 years ago
Why is it you go always go against Rigby KEKW
Last tourney it was also vs Rigby
But I guess makes sense, similar level
yay another chapter 4 less seed :(
Well at least boots won't be a problem or Super Watt
Well finding watt could be the problem lmao
Yeah true Ch 4 not required does hurt finding the Child
may  you still find watt anyway
Did I tell you the story of the entitlement and audacity of a person I had to deal with? monadoWheeze
In discord server I’m in, there’s a buy sell trade section
Person posts a listing and amongst the items is a thing I’m interested in. So as one does I ask how much for it
And hour later. Another person also asks how much same thing is
And then 20 minutes later seller comes back, names the price. It’s in my budget, so I publicly post I’ll take it and DM the seller. This was 2 minutes after they named the price
I see where this is going
i own a server with a buy sell trade section. i have heard this story one or two times 🥲
in the paper pits of hell
We talk it out. Seller, needs to find out how much shipping will add, so I haven’t paid yet
But seller marks that item sold on the post, fast forward 7 hours later. Other guys posts on the thread, “I’ll take it, DM me [seller]”
I then get a DM from the other guy monadoWheeze
oh this is taking an interesting turn
Them: “Going to ask that you cancel the purchase”
i mean... i admire the dedication, i guess
But then I get a message from the seller
I’m a mod in this discord server
Seller says other guy DMed him and was offering him more money. But he was going with me because I wasn’t an ass
Seller shares me the DMs other guy sent him
Oh boy this is going to get spicy from what you're about to say
I saw ultra hammer. What was the other?
Your sacrifice will not be in vain Sushie
“Sellers should communicate with all interested parties first. I’m going to ask you to refund Allegrenix and relist the item.”
@Allegrenix bish said what the fuck now?
If they really want the item that bad and they missed a first come first serve kind of deal go to EBay or Amazon
i need popcorn for all this tea being given
Where did you guys think the story was going?
Or if it was a trading card of some sort TCG Player
you didn't get the item you wanted KEKW
yeah no i figured you were gonna get screwed by the seller
@Allegrenix if it was an item I could easily procure a 2nd copy of I woulda just asked the other person to pay like 10x then like gotten you a second version of it and given you like half the profit cause I'm a POS LUL
I’m getting an ad for finding mental health resources. I think Twitch is trying to tell me something.
To add a bit more saltiness on the wound. Plush is my favorite character, I wouldn’t be surprised if I have largest plush collection of her
(It’s Princess Celestia from MLP for context)
and I have the rightful reputation of being a mega fan
Oh I'm not a brony so I wouldn't get it but if rage happens it happens
My friend just bought a Nightmare Moon pin
In the brony community plushies are kinda like status symbols
Like they can go for 1k +
But those are for what are considered “life sized” plush
oh okay that's more reasonable but still 1k is a lot lmao.
There is no agreed upon number for lifesize
Hey as a plush maker myself
I can understand the figurine obsession though
And how some people go really crazy for them
Like when a yard of fabric is 15$
and you have a character that makes up of 7 colours
if only that was a potential item instead of all those goddamn coins.
Faux fur, which can be 25$ a yard and also really annoying to work with
If this string of bad partners keep up we may have to rely on Mario
I'll be getting some cakes for tomorrow
Anyways to get back to the main story. Person threw a fit, because I already have so many plushies of said character and they didn’t have any
Before they threw the fit, I brought up the situation to mod team in case it escalated (which it did)
all chapters 7 scaled rando when?
But they were like “/shrug Lesson learned for them, if they want a plush badly enough, gotta jump on it like our resident Sunpreme Celestia fan”
(Sunpreme because she’s like the sun goddess in the show)
hey you got a coin, it coulda been worse, it coulda been an FX badge! That coin might matter
see like that coin made it so you had 69 coins (before you bought that), that coin was extremely important!
What is Bow doing with an Egg
egg, that means optimal RNG will occur ::D
No watt sucks, but no goombario is like adding insult to injury...
But yeah no Child hurts unless a random check along the path is that child
is that softlock fixed in the rando or nah?
catching the item off the tree while it's in midair
rip EGG it was nice knowing you
Hey Bow's Egg did some good
Is that 2 full dungeons you get to skip all checks?
how'd you get back in bed so fast Tubba?
you should prolly get that fixed
@MarioManTAW yeah and all that time saved means it can be spent dipping chapter 4 instead Kappa
gonna assume this seed cooked good for runnin it?
these caps, wtf are you, Goombario???
clearly gotta put on refund :P
just real quick back to back wins
I wanna see what a chapter 4 dip woulda gotten you lol
This one went better than the last one i take it?
only because of badges and Ultra Boots
damn, I completely forgot to shill for the VOD
alright bye all tanked out and all
1st time in a long time wasnt first
this game is so darn pretty
Mr. Orange favorite things to do: dance and make trees look amazing
What does the holy bone do?
I really should get back to platinum this
I just need the fish fontai3Done
me like comeing here cause i get noticed
phantom you've do so good with these cherry bombs
oh it the dragon that was being mean last time in the walk
i swear down im getting a insane amount of ads
ok im back  so  why doggo need sword
Hey ! I hope you're doing well. I think it's dope that you're running Okami ❤️❤️❤️
Are you liking the game (Speedrun) so far ?
As long are you're having fun, practice will make the skills
That solution is too much... very lazy
The itsy bitsy spider helped the do go up
GL with Okami Phan! Gonna go get food
still dont see why dog need  sword tho
dog need sword because sword like long tooth
N Ryoshima is best music of the game
do you get any of the cherry bomb/power slash upgrades?
gotcha so its just precise movement
hey - we like ourselves repetitive thing no? goomeeDerp *looks at power bounces*
if its not precise like that, dont sound bad at all just a rythm to get into
Think of this way  it 1 practice for skip   and future time save
are u legit pumped for the Transformers one movie this week or u were never an autobots kid?
Is this game actually like a zelda game like people say it is?
I was cleaning and wanted to take a break and I have the sneezes
must of picked up some hair on the cords when I was changing the fish filter

help I cant stop playing tcg card shop sim
I missed last time how'd it go?
day 1 7 hours yesterday 9 hours
yeah the tackle has no range when it comes to opening chests lol
get all them gold splits phanto274Gold
People when they're cursed in this game be like: 🗿
This is a no upgrades run
if okami jumps in water does he dissolve?
so ages got updated for ap got key sanity and dungeon ER and we got a pop tracker too
hardest move in the game. circle
even harder than that is circle with a line through it
as we will come to see I'm sure
Big pb today, I can feel it
It took me like 10 playthroughs to realize you could ink her lmao
just a minor suggestion: the splits have a lotbof whitespace, maybe increase font size to make it less empty?
Was fun! We played through a Sonic fan game called Sonic and the Fallen Star matoisHiya
Yes indeed, with a very unique sprite artstyle
too bad you didnt pull a huge fish and it said “miniscule salmon”
but it saves like 30 seconds LUL
skipping the ball pushing should be against the rules it's the most fun part of the game!
for a sec I thought you meant in game and I was like I don't remember there being cats to feed in here LUL
issun why is it that the one time you gotta sneeze it causes a fricken natural disaster???
hardest part of the game, walking on logs
leap first think later issun, stfu
I think the worst area for me was Kamui just cause ice physics sucks.
yeah if you just run through it it's fine but if you're tryna like 100% it or just explore, it becomes annoying quickly.
when do we get sword doggo
yeah you get the sword off orochi
you get beads earlier, off crimson something or another iirc, but not a sword I don't think.
if only we had the power of night :(
it has to be night time
I'm surprised waiting 50 seconds is slower than just starting at Kamiki tbh
no you need to get there slower so you wait less :P
are the flowers being nicer today
I don't think slashing in midair works
this minigame is so trash tho
that's odd a wolf just spawned here and started filling up my giant bucket
seriously tho why is her bucket 3x the size of her
Time for peak in a video game
and why does Susano leave her there to carry it back like through a river and like dangerous monster infested areas?
wow, just need a frog and you'll have the whole Animal Crossing set
Whopper, Whopper, Whopper, Whopper Junior, Double, Triple Whopper Flame-grilled taste with perfect toppers rule this day Lettuce, mayo, pickle, ketchup It's okay if don't want that Impossible or bacon Whopper Any Whopper my way
What do they call the whopper in the french translation?
ammy why can't you grow thumbs and just throw the bombs at the doggos???
lmao I don't think I've ever seen Kushi there cause I always warp back LUL
she's slowly getting back but idk how she's gonna get down that cliff...
yeah the bombs don't like exploding if they spawn on an enemy
hope the run is going well
ooh cat statue, we should go back here for that totally :P
and now to KT glitch in the void for 7 min, oh wait this isn't NG+ :D
wonder how much time just not having to deal with the camera pans would save, prolly like 10 min over the course of a run lmao
hey I see that you're on fire, Ammy. You should prolly not do that...
hardest jumps in the game lmao
the flowers being good or bad
you get issun dialogue if you try to repair the stairs, cause you get issun dialogue for everything you do that's wrong :D
what is the actual story for doggo game
time for a very detailed drawing
worth the 3 seconds that cost :D
I know u usually play the one where he's a furry but
is the one with Wolf Link
no this is the one with Wolf Link
I remember being stuck here for hours
cept you're Link instead of Kirby
Yeah, just won my race vs Zeddikus
Group3, but PinkReaper is a RiadBoss ^^'
i think he'll win this group unless i put up a miracle
But those settings are not friendly to me, i check too many spots and so lose time, PinkReaper got me by 12m on our first seed together :-(
I'm trying to improve by doing many practice seeds, we'll see how it happens on our next race ^^
but hey, enough of me, gl on your speedrun ^^
it'd be funny if you could use wind to speed him up
or Bloom similar to the digging games
ammy maybe you'd aim your bombs better if you could see. maybe cut some holes in that mask...
this is like playing golf but if your head was the club
it's like playing soccer with a bowling ball
Average game of golf be like:
is it that dragon thingy time
bye imp mask you were really cute while you lived tho :(
and yeah 8 headed dragon snake thingy
yay doggo gets thw sword he doesnt need soon
Me thinking this was the final boss
It's prolly hard to notice but there's a different song at the beginning before you try to hit him once lol
ISSUN WHY ARE YOU TALKIN IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT!?
The susano sword slashing prolly took me like 10 tries the first time I played the game altho in my defense I was like 7 or 8 lol.
But it's party time you gotta talk to everybody!
Time to blow up a village! And then blame somebody else for it!
just read the giant sign in the sky :P
rip that side of city checkpoint
prolly wouldn't lose much time if it didn't take like 15 seconds for the match to end once you kill everybody
yeah but they suck to fight casually so out of principle they should be skipped :P
time to learn how to piss for demon fangs!
oh we're not learning that? laaame. double jump works too ig...
Second verse same as the first
gotta keep profits high to buy all those exorcism slips
Hey all yes made it for midgame fave part.
yo did u check out that music video and did u do that ice arrow seed before?
we bought this dude a rod, did all the fishing for him, and he gets all the credit
altho ig we get to sell the fish
I wasn't talkin to you Phantom bot
didnt come up with any adjectives for issun yet
im not gonna try and figure out how Issun expects that relationship to work when she's like 500x the size of him...
1 issun, 5 ft tall woman
true, maybe he encourages her to get hammered.
oh no he's back with avengeance!
gl with thje dog fast, hope they behave on the walkies
the hand of kelp, hardest enemy in the game
melons ditched us cause she didn't want to get eaten, laaame.
You should change the split to "Get Hammered" :D
now time to get reeeaaally hammered
I like to think that the reason the lines can be done horizontally is cause Kasugami is so drunk that it looks vertical to him
oh Kasugami is female apparently my b
why'd he inhale a mirror and a shrime
your highness why do you look like you're moving with your stomach?
I wish my house had an interior lava moat :(
it's called advancing the plot Issun, cmon, you know we gotta accept all missions given to us
oh right I forgot, time for the actual hardest jump in the game LUL
I think it has to be more over the root but idk I've never tried it lol
This celestial brush power is just whatever and hardly used for anything
Ammy is more responsible than Pallos, Ammy feeds cats
mine was miserable no sugar coatin lie. Got into major fist and spit fight with dad (Hopefully Covid wont start again) Wish urs better darkness.
pretty sure it's the only brush technique with absolutely zero combat use
water spout is used for orochi
and can be used for putting fire enemies out
IG technically catwalk is used for Yami
but you don't have to use it.
@stavros12c34anenoglou Sorry to hear that. Hopefully tomorrow will be better for ya. Mine was pretty uneventful which ig is a good thing.
oh ig rejuvenation has no combat use either I don't think.
idk it seems pretty logical to me. wind makes things spin.
issun stop disorienting everything with your stupid dialogue!
@En_Passant Now if you're confused about that, how tf did all this shit get in here!?
there are water spouts on the other side do those not go high enough?
Time for the fight with draining ink
oh no something bad is happening!
what that is, who knows? cause we've been skipping all the cutscenes!
see if you had watched the cutscene you'd see where you were supposed to go! :P
Yeah you go get your lens of truth in a well
wow rao made that rock invisible!
all his dumbass speeches make the camera fall asleep
pro tip if you ever have to fight ammy, don't run head first into her bombs.
if only we had a way to force it to be night time...
shoudla split after every tobi battle
a fight you can't skip!? In this game!? what is this!?
well you can still skip it with exorcism slips but you can't dodge the trigger :(
the combat in this game is really fun I swear
it's not supposed to be like this XD
thanks spiked wheels of bad camera
nice Unreal symbols on the fences
yo how you doing here dude?
what did you think i said lolz
yeah how did you get here lolz jk
i see you've gotten use to the maze
I can see where Mario Galaxy got some of their level ideas
@AnniLyn2 well Ammy got hammered and then went in the emperor's mouth and fought bad breath then did the awful digging minigame and kaguya went back to her home planet and then Ammy went in the water dragon's mouth and fought stomach cancer or some shit and then ninetails merc'd melons and himiko, and now we're here to get revenge and merc ninetales
and that's how we got here
Sorta works...sounds like you were describing an episode of magic school bus mixed with code lyoko
I take it back. Magic school bus and Inuyasha
Tobi can not be spared tho :(
I'm not ready I don't have a drink
ooh I wonder what this god will give you!?
we don't need a pan for that game...
how longdoes this tunnel have to be to go all the way to ice land?
transforming into doggo won't prevent you from getting nuked.
oh is the other one optional?
or does that not count as massive damage lol.
there's a 3rd in casual, you use water spout to make the fruit in N. ryoshima come to life, but ig that's not required for progression
didn't pray to ammy hard enough
and now for the long run
I can't, you keep turning the camera away from it
why don't you slow down and let me see the boat
it's that dino thing that commits tax fraud
kai is used to the cold and thus is immune to ice
You guys ever come back from the dentist wishing you were dead?
if only this was NG+ and you could just melt all those pos ice blocks
yeah time to get hammered again!
Take a drink for me Darkness!
ff.f.ffffast sounds like a cool website
A website of just looking at sonic run across the screen
Your annoyance by Issun is my annoyance by Fi
ammy you're a goddess you should be better at running on ice
get 99 more and you'll be invincible!
hey where'd you come from oki?
I wonder why exorcism slips work on humans
Muted but gl on holy doge gaming
and this weird af looking shinshu field
well technically not unique cause Kaguya is also an alien but she's not an enemy ig altho the digging game is an enemy to fun so she kinda is.
Not the pretty doggo with tattoos?
Ammy is the pretty doggo with the tats too
yeah but I mean she's a goddess s she can do whatever tf she wants
but yeah her actual name is Amaterasu but Issun calls her Ammy so everyone calls her ammy.
altho at least with this one it's easier to see
ooh we can go get hammered again!
there's a button that shows you the map btw but I totally forget what it is lol. prolly one of the analog sticks.
ah yes the weight puzzle :(
yo nice lobs from Ammy there.
Moving to behind time laptop. My phone is dying
rip another lock, murdered by the white demon of death.
when one door opens, another amount of progress is unlocked
who puts cannons in their shrine to the gods anyway
well to be fair some asshole owls took over the shrine so they prolly put it there.
hey it's the itsy bitsy spiders
run in a circle til you gain momentum trick
yay most fun room in the game time
what the hell did I just witness
geez you had literally 1 HP
perhaps the team work was the nukes we collected along the way
left to drown in the lake
hmm where have I seen this boss before...
YOOOO it's dark Gaia from sonic unleashed swifPog
This is yamata no orochi isn't it
this song is pretty fire tho so I don't mind it being played 3 times.
and it's actually a really fun bossfight when you don't have access to WMDs
Why do you have to access windows media devices
oh hey you haven't fought this boss in 4 hours so it's basically a new boss
goes down just as easy tho
the boss rush shoulda been fighting all 5 at once, woulda saved you like 10 nukes
they're all people that got merc'd by these demons cause they were too stupid to create exorcism slips or some shit like that idk.
You know yami does make sense to be the final boss
I don't think you'll be able to see cause Phantom just nukes the shit out of him, but yami is a goldfish btw
So the darkness is a goldfish
yo Phantom btw I have a question when it comes to rando redemption, can it be a game that's not on the list if it's no key item shuffling, just playing the game normally? My thought was Gale of Darkness (or Colosseum if you prefer) with just randomized pokemon and types / type charts and items and stuff like that
also damn the vote was very close
or is cause it's still going on ig
In Hyrule's fields, beneath the skies,   Link searches high where the lost keys lie.   Through forests thick and mountains tall,   Each hidden nook, he must explore all.    With courage bright and heart so true,   He seeks the locks, for the quest anew.   From shadows deep to temples grand,   Unlocking fate with each brave hand. Cheer100
I recently assembled my Falcon Armor model kit
funny part, I *just* beat OoT 3D right before the stream announcement
I cant wait to the see Iza revisit LUL
Uaually for me its more like "I really enjoyed this seed, I wonder how Phantom would play it"
@Axl_SR well I don't really do randos for any of the games on the list unfortunately lol.
yeah this is prolly gonna be a while I presume.
I did an all dungeons once, was a fun time
Does no excluded checks mean you're doing Palace of Twilight? D:
whod you feel about the race?
oh did you not have your second race?
hope you are doing well today
Just another 900 more tokens until I can get VIP status
Also Echoes of Wisdom in less than a week
im almost at 3 rando seeds lol
I'll be headed off to the Nintendo store when the game is on sale
i have a feeling its gonna be like botw but 2d
So would it be called Poeinty thing?
Yeah I'd assume the full game would have more interesting and free routing
I saw that someone 3D printed the switch2 leak. The joy cons were much larger but still wish it wasnt joycons
until i redeem lets go pikachu KEKW
joycons are fine on the handheld but yeah using them off is eww.
hey you might need that wallet :P
Switch Lite was made for baby Trump hands Phantom.
Darkness I can use them off longer than I can in handheld
buy one of those big ole joy cons
thats the thing tho, we should need to buy a playable controller
i played and beat Metroid dread in only handheld mode
and then the switch wont even fit in cargo shorts
yeah the joycons that just stick onto your tv that's what Phantom needs.
do they have notches at least?
Noice, he had the heavy shoes
That's why Zelda is now taking his place in the next game
Oh wow that's actually a useful hint
we could fill it with anything!
This poe is an oxymoron, holding the container that will eventually contain it
5 bombs for 200 rupies!? what a ripoff
oh btw phantom, quest master today added a pouch so you can have two weapons at once to combine effects. like dropping a bomb and throwing a boomerang at it so it goes across gaps
now we just need bomb arrows
horse don't run off a cliff
i was gone for 5 mins and a bot walk in AngyTwink
they know when the mods walk out LUL
i was just doing my dailies on a game too KEKW
I like to call Keysanity funsanity
well that's good to know at least
aww I wanted to see cats :(
no excluded checks means the the thing right? I forget what its called so ill just call it "pit of 100 trials" LUL
how do you know you need master sword?
oh howling statues are in too
That means probably swords are coming soon
1 bomb for 100 rupees that's basically a ripoff
also poe at east castle town
One out of every 8 bugs is good as gold
If the game would be nice enough to hand over spinner and dom rod and 2 swords...
not sure if this is in logic but when you first enter forest temple and save the first monkey you can reach the 2 spiders on the vine wines withwolf link
ooh, 1/8 chance of being useful!
you can use the nuts without a slingshot?
once I had slingshot in logic for SG grotto
cause Y would you use it?
This ain't no OoT where it has a use
they should make it so slingshot is the first progressive bow item :D
now you can get that wallet some idiot dropped in the water :P
If the other keys aren't necessary that would be the only bug we needed
I highly recommend Transformers One. I was blown away.
is this a 5 dungeon seed or 3
phantom 1 day me wana race u
but only 1 i personaly know is minish cap
I forgot there's a poe here lmao
The banana will be ours soon
yay now we can be rich
Oh yeah this is the prelude
hope the seed's so far not cookin too much shenanigans? PrideLaugh
Now if that warped us to ToT
so a decent share of "nonsense but not bad nonsense yet" rly
meanwhile I am currently just havin PMD on a menu listening to the pokemon village theme cus I am roundabout at the point of having more about half of the remaining "recruit" recruits behindplaces such as joyous tower
so everything is locked behind sky characters lmao
hey at least that means that AG will not be toooo hard on ya logically speaking
how did zora armor fly like that???
@Darkness3827 link still needs to wash it out, ook used monkey droppings to make it stiff PrideLaugh
thats a warp from ooccooo from within a dungeon
so that works, but having multiple doesnt work...?
tells ya how often I messed with the ManChicken in vanilla rly PrideLaugh
link strong af to push those giant blocks with 0 traction
not the all dungeons keysanity no excluded checks
combat was already trivial we have bomb arrows and ball and chain
Even more trivial and now glowy pointy thing%
why did you hide 2 of the swords here?
woulda been funny if you found 1 right after saying that
Damn I wish I wasn't high rn and remember that lja
What are the chances that the 1/23 will work out
oh 1 in 23 for CitS yeah
oh right I forgot it was SPR
It would be so based if Phantom Hourglass won
@TheGlubbers It is all of them afterall
Gonna be a rupee I'm calling it
@Monado poe soul or insect CorgiDerp
I'd prefer Gale personally but PH and Kazooie are both cool
@Jonxhas I guess we shall see
you can also LJA from that ledge
I disappeared lolz rain setting up chaos seed
that ledge is where hundo LJAs from
these would likely work if you delayed the actual JA btw
everything is behind sky characters LUL
What are you trying to do?
im also confused what they're trying to do
while clipped into the handrail of the bridge in 1st person, you're able to spin freely or nah?
for the post clip-alignment I mean
I got that bit, was moreso wondering in regard to the 1st person view
cus while in 1st person suuurely link doesnt move
im wondering if lack of a shield makes your target slashes not the same as with shield
cuz otherwise i don't know what's going on differently
@TheGlubbers that would be hilarious if so 🤣
ESPECIALLY given you can lose a wooden shield
yeah 3x backflips and upright, no IB
Time for the first boss of the seed
It looks so different after you smoke
Time to play prelude of light
what could grove rly be at this point if its NOT on the pedestal?
or does pedestal not require swords to check?
Time to engage the Oocoo skip
ooccoo go back to where we put you
You crazy...best dungeon is forest temple
And now the 1 million dollar question, where is the lamp here
just one thing has a fuel bar, the other has a magic bar or no magic bar depending on how the game in question feels
They need to make a golden keese in Echoes of Wisdom and have that be the thing that can defeat Lonk
That jump is hard to do man
ToT having the horde and still no promised lamp
Speak of the lamp and it appears
despite how often I reset for darknu cheevo stuff
so hopefully none of that stuff was important
More like it's now fully the hunt for keys
you're forced to use oocoo or just lose time
also I won my match only cuz I put weeks of practice into city
cuz i mistracked underwater lake chest, cuz I meant to do the spring and then get it but I just forgot to do it
and it had fishing rod 2
so I should have lost by all accounts
but I had a flawless city and argorok and just kinda out executioned the opponent
it also helped that the boss key was in baba tower
So going reverse didn't save time
actually lost them time cuz I went forward
also yeah I didn't really know the extent of how big execution gap can be until I did it
I was an entire dungeon behind and some how still won
and I don't think my opponent was even bad
yeah I watched a little of it too
also I told you already I think you're favored vs tuba, cuz tuba is a good rando player but I think you have a bigger trick arsenal and execution
Also I don't think routing matters that much in tpr
you can just copy what the best players do early game
it doesn't vary that much from seed to seed
and in many cases you just ignore item difference and finish sphere 0 1
its not MM variance on certain settings yea
but there is some variance in there
like - its not a case of "oh fuck termina field, clock town how do timed checks"
most the variance in tpr comes from your sphere 3-5
cuz the dungeon orders can be what decides your race
with like 10 different ways of tackling the oder of things there as an example
wonder what the WR for goats is
I've also started to realize that dungeon rushing is not always good lol
seeds have felt allot better the more I got done in the early game ow wise
cuz it means my mid late game is easier clean up rather than full clear everything
also when are we adding hype cave back in
the reason they removed it was cuz it made seeds boring
I mean you cant really do it out of logic though can you?
does it require the lamp to see or something
yeah like watching on stream it's pitch black lol
every cave is impossible to see in if you dont tweak settings
we cant even see on stream in this one
also is there execution diff in paper mario or is it more just combat knowledge
I can barely see on stream lol
All I see is like Link and tufts of grass
Hullo! I am new been hunting for zelda streamers
i like that the game lets you do that
gonna be like the shop keeper in links awakening
more like peck yeah, free oil PrideLaugh
see my brain just thought "wait its 24 bugs"
hence why the 23 just kinda didnt make sense to me PrideLaugh
yeah, technically I'm calculating the odds of getting CitS small key cause that might be important.
Our cat who is always grumpy and doesn't wanna be touched... just ruined his face on my foot
it saves like 5 seconds figuring out what far away items arew
yea that is on the menu isnt it
cat hide & seek best mission
and a golf to set up
but phantom it'd be funnier if its in there rather then before there
what if golf stole it from impa
ashei should be forced to stfu if what she gives you is useless :P
unless the prize is 10 rupies
Sorry agitha... you have a problem lol
so more protein for midna then
now time to do the cat hide & seek just for funsies :D
now you can call your horse from anywhere tho
but what if that poe has the final sky character? :P
NOW you can call your horse from anywhere!
The only checks shad has is the owl statue and hidden village right?
do you have to do cat hide and seek for the poe?
Up middle up middle at the end
I checked the vod, the Impaz check was Forest Temple key
for 2 big keys, one you don't need anymore thankfully
can you aim the boomerang down there?
maybe boomerang to on top of the railing and dangle off of the railing insead of the edge?
sound of clawshot hitting a wall distracted them into jumping to their deaths
I feel like clawshot should just murder them
and you need like 20 twilight small keys right?
Yeah since you would grab them from the head with the claw
They're the boss of all slimes
Gtg...GL Phan...and some phanto274GG phanto274GG for the end
link why can't you stab Argorok like 20 times more while he's falling to the ground?
no wonder hes so pissed ://
is that how he had the power to breathe fire?
So you killed the dragon when it just needed flea medication
what's worse, floor 17 or ice block puzzle?
Thank you for the hundo ptsd
Fair enough I'll take the boobs as reward
I've already lost count of the floor Phantom is on lmao
Jesus her face is so bas
Idk maybe she looks like a man?
But also the gf I know has triangle tits so
I've been watching some of your runs on yt and I was wondering: What's the difference between dominion rod 1 and 2?
I actually did not know that that's interesting ty
They're equally useless unless it's tot
well there's double dom rod :P
At this point it's more like where is Hyrule Castle BK
But yeah Morpheel is in logic now
At the same time as Blizetta
@SwiftPichu_ Nah that's Okami lakebed where boobs needs the key :P
So Armagohma was our first boss by logic I'm guessing
How to start this OoT themed Twilight Princess allsanity
@Rgamer0 I don't think so cause it was locked behind 3 swords
We found like 2 swords here and a sword somewhere else
And this was before Blizetta came into logic
ToT BK was the first one found alongside like 2 of its own small keys
Which had to be done to get lamp
Remember to treat wild pork with care as it has parasites
Or even better the big key shard
Leevers or Keese as the worst recurring Zelda enemy?
I used to be a bulblin adventurer then I took an arrow to the elbow and died
chapter 1237? That's too many chapters my guy
he sure didn't see that coming
oh you can spinner through the spikes? neat
Time to see if the beyblade arena has any big key pieces
Okay literally Goron mines go mode
idk could a shard be behind one of the keys?
So the answer is just rush to mines and get the hint
Or Stallord is just a bigger poe sibling
phase 1 is kinda annoying, phase 2 is fine
Hii Phantom phanto274Wave how are you?
On the path to a go mode
Doing alright, just got off work.. been so busy lately, I miss stream phanto274Cry
So estimated finishing time of this seed
you never got double dom rod right?
Because you need so much in order to even get there
that's also kinda surprising I feel like
At that point in order to make the palace of Twilight mean something you have to literally have the warp point to it open
At the very start of the game
the problem with palace isn't the item requirements
its the fact if its required you automatically must also do arbiters
when you play all dungeons it doesn't matter, but in every other context
Yeah in order to open Palace to more checks probably have to just make the warp to it open at start
you have 3 fused and you have to do an entire unrequired arbiters just cuz
cuz I WOULD LOVE to have palace as a possible dungeon
the zant fight is super fun
and palace is a cool dungeon
That's why leave it to link to Hurricane spin
do you not need the dungeon reward
And now for the boring part, the climb to ganondork
When you eliminate double dom rod checks from the pool things will go a little bit faster
The first Darknut of the seed
yeah no double dom rod and go mode PoT and Hyrule make things much faster
altho ordeals wasted a good amount of time
maybe that's why it said it was required lmao
maybe double dom rod is why?
Ganondork took tips from X6 Sigma who's drunk
Well it woulda been sub 6 if you hadn't dipped treasure room lmao.
so unofficial sub 6 lol phanto274GG
I look away for a sec, and Ganondorf's been obliterated
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
idk wtf that means but sure I'll do it!
that was a peepoComfy stream was lurking
hey Phantom! GL with the race lueygaGoodLuck lueygaWahoo
Listening to Clone Hero music and watching a PM rando race. Good day.
So you can see sub-chat lol
i could see sub chat just not the vc KEKW
There's some CH songs that shouldn't work but they do and end up being so much fun to listen to.
So you can join the next sync/async
Goombario start means you know it's gonna be a good seed
love to see goomba matching Mario like that lueygaGoodLuck
watching both and have your time about 8 seconds ahead
@Axl_SR Adam always has a few seconds of stream delay if that's what you're talking about
With the way it had mostly coins, star pieces and badges I'd be surprised if four is needed.
no chapter 4 time for sadness :(
So 4 for a power plus and that's it
yay all that for a coin :D
yo that's a hype change for the panel to break there
Okay Parakarry, he might be worth endgame...assuming he gets upgrades
Your hair looks different...or I'm losing memory lolz
All this to get Super boots from chapter 3
I will booli Phantom's bot any day it's me the rood birb
cant wait to see the thumbnail for this seed LUL 󠀀
I saw that smirk Phantom lmaooo
What's that rando where you exit one place and enter an entirely different area
I feel like I'm being trolled now lolz
can also be dungeon shuffle if it's specifically just dungeons
That sounded like a painful wolf
Pidgey you are just the sassiest today
overworld/coinblocks I feel aren't nearly as bad
my race went real bad today, my controller disconnected 3 times during it NotLikeThis
I'm a little sassy. I'm eating cornchip
I feel like panels suck more if you have late boots
You know what I should get a milkshake in honor of Echoes of Wisdom
so this is just, the worst seed ever? Who rolled this?
I did cause I'm a hater /lh
Dunno about worst but obnoxious most certainly
Lol. Knew 4 wasn't going to be needed.
t need to go to ch 2 for any reason right
If we had Watt could at least go to 5
We get a brick seed ?
:V I will eat this seed if u give me one cornchip
oh that toss animation is CUTE
gamers are angry at randomized paper mario
just heard Adam say this was the submission vod for GDQ lol
oh hey a life shroom :D
there is literally no where else she could be
holy shit she was in the chest?
So how is your power output at least?
so it could technically be worse
i feel like i haven't seen a below vanilla Power Plus in weeks
we're going for world record most chapter 3 dives
so with other words I am hearing rando chose violence
anyhow: the reason I am upset with pidgeys right?
its NOT because I dislike pidgey as a pokemon
but bc rescue team shoved pidgey into a 1% spawn on 5 floors or so in a single dungeon
when you ALWAYS recruit it at lv.1
therefore meaning you will have FUN trying to protect it
cus the place got monster houses
and then you need 3 of them to evolve
cus you cant really recruit pidgeotto and end evo stages are just straight up off limits for recruit
Oooof. I feel you on that.
at LEAST its not in a lv.1 dungeon
but then there's also the case of silcoon / cascoon and beautifly / dustox
where you CAN recruit the cocoon stage of wurmple
so you dont have to roll rng on whch direction wurmple wants to go for ya
BUT cascoon and silcoon both DO NOT MOVE ON THE MAP
and I need both twice if I dont wanna roll with lots of wurmple and prayge
and while you CAN make encounters such as pidgey mildly easier by going through a different dungeon and using shaymins help
I kinda chose not to do that
cus I dont really wanna HAVE to prep my recruits beforehand as shaymin variant => A random pokemon you dont have yet recruited joins you
ANY of the ones you're missing
and I aint doin that when I am still missing like 100 including where I still need to evolve shit
not when shaymin is ALSO behind a lv.1 dungeon
which - as you know - lv1 dungeons are ROUGH as they usually have 99 floors
what was that blue badge there
am I just self-roping my brain in thinkin that that badge was ttyd only or...?
been so long since last I saw that badge in pape64
oh good I haven’t missed all of it
Darn I came in late who won and is chat turned off?
Oh so Im in time and u can read.
I'd like to come out and apologize for any complaining I've ever done on any past seed.
so this is what, the 10th time in Chapter 3?
i definitely would have DNF'd cus I'd literally never, if given 100 attempts, remember that that check was even there
im bad at remembering what rooms in the desert have coin blocks
@Axl_SR there's actually only 1 room that has a coin block that doesn't also have an item block
there are 2 rooms that have a single coin block on the ground right?
I forgot to get that one today Kappa
routing from the left always sucks imo
Adam also lost a large chunk of his lead looking for sushi
what the actual fuck was that seed
At least you didn't go there.... 5 times
Damn I missed out on some torture
I actually debated asking you if you wanted to re-roll
I thought panels would not be so bad having only 4 chapters but this seed proved me wrong
I left for a bit...how'd it go?
Damn man :/ sorry to hear
Oh it did trust me I dont blame yuou
I think Axl saved this one for the hall of infamy
I honestly would have asked to re-roll
because I thought I was missing something the whole time
this see3d was just a monster
Aw shes so ocute in blue
bad seed? looks really fast to me
..... Quadruple and dip can't exist in the same sentence, that's illegal
I went there with no tubba keys KEKW
so what I hear is a whooole lot of "this could have been plando'd" PrideLaugh holy moly
I love that I know these words eventhough this isnt my rando. and I hate these words
someone did ask me if this was a plando
or rather: "hey its a shit plando"
what are the s3 settings in a nutshell?
@Loverish 4 chapters req, 3 not needed and therefore entirely junked
I am all for doing a possible S4 settings for the videeo submission
shuffled partners, partner upgrades, couple other things
I wanna know what the sphere count is
which sphere is the bed tubba key
and like 4 of them by sound are a bit of a rope-a-dope
"bs plando mappers preppin their maniacal laughter prepping worse shit while listening" 🤣
and thats being said when I have seen FUN plando seeds
where you were presented an actual puzzle rather then "whats the worst of the worst we could do to someone"
I propose no panels and partner upgrade shuffle for our submission KEKW
that bad and still so fast. LEgendary
like - silly most likely, but: would you ever EVER think of touching OoT rando or nah?
I don't kow how this wasn't longer
@Loverish I mean you ARE looking at people who speedrun pape
they know their shit WAYY more then you or I
I wanted to see a quad quint dip so bad oh well till next genned bad seed
@Jonxhas yeah and sometimes they probably lose the perspective that they are amazing lol
the main reason I am asking about it phantom is cus I could then recommend ya a couple fun plandos
in ad - are you going to keep going\
@Loverish naah - all chapters as an example I know took phantom, jcog and others like about the 4 hours range ish on average
I wanna say at least that that is at about the average
meanwhile I'd be sitting there with like 1.5 to 1.75x that cus "not avoiding encounters as much, silly testing outs of dummy ideas"
I feel like we need to each other's side by side
dont let goombario be useful Prayge
I don’t have anything fancy tbh KEKW
I watched it side by side but wouldd be down to see it with commentary
something I should mess with honestly
I’m trying to keep that handy somewhere convenient
cus as much as I'd not necessarily need it
because I would like to do that at some point
phantom I need input: do I do the next batch of awful recruiting or nah...?
it'll still be better than that last pos
rando rando, roll the dice. what grunty rolled will set the price!
*me sitting here imagining grunty rolling all rando seeds for everyone behind the scenes*
curious to hear the reasons to OoTR related offstrim given it sounded like a big ol' tangent btw PrideFlower
the balcony was fixed though - he just left it there for you cus he was done tippiGiggle
REROLL, NOT RANDOM ENOUGH Madge furriot
yo the price on that jelly ultra is outrageous
that's like 3 months wage at least
yeah the one before that was on the fucking atari lmao
i mean there was a 360 version but it wasn't NEW new ya know
isn't there a 2nd one you can get that way but it's not in logic?
so over/under 4 dips for chapter 3 this seed?
ooh can the 80 minute bombette npc push to enter the ruins be in logic for this seed? :D
yeah phantom where's that guy's bike
dude just needs to do more checks obviously
So a baked goods shop huh
Reminder that I'm going for some baked goods and a milkshake this Thursday
In honor of Echoes of Wisdom releasing after getting the game
legends spoke of a place where everything was toys but it remained buried under the sands for eons
Thar is one stacked set of checks
This toy box is full of joy
the last one gives me the most trouble
So kind of a baby seed for these settings
A literal baby spot for Chapter 7
The theme of jelly shrooms in shops
Oh I know I meant if you won or lost lol
Because the settings being dogshit is a given
45 seconds, 2:01:44 to 2:02:29 :(
did you have any chapters beaten in an hour 24 in the race? LUL
Yo, Phantom. How's the rando(s) today? phanto274GL
you've seen this playbook before and know what to do.
He just wanted to see the Boos dance again
if only having two of 3 stones made the trick easier
if you ever need recommendations I got like 5 billion lmao.
here before the horror era starts phanto274Bless
that eye roll said it all
how did the rest of trashfire seed go?
😔 I got back from chores seeing the parade
when you do randomizers do you use a capture card or like project 64?
okay. I was just curious because I have a capture card and I have the switch version and the actual Nintendo 64 one. I wouldn’t race but I think these are fun
have no idea of emulator setups either
Mupen + core tends to do good fwiw
nothin beats console ofc but it's much better than what I've seen for virtual console options
Did they ever make Paper Mario merch?
I think there may have been,
"Official merchandising-wise, there's not much - the only ones I know of are a few sets of stickers (which I think are no longer being produced), a sticker book (which might still be available through Amazon Japan), and a few rubber pass cases (that I've never seen available on a site that allows importing)."
oh lmao, that may have been for......sticker star
if they did stickers for sticker star, what'd they do for color splash? oil paintings?
RA huh? Looks like I'm getting people into it, or back into it ohheyi30Hehe
it's nice to have more pape people in it though too PrideLaugh
I know Bonecrusher has been doing it for quite a while
any plans for next year yet? Given we're headed towards October
I did not till you told me about it like 2-3 weeks ago lol.
oh how was the race with Adam earlier?
it was pretty horseshit from the one hour I caught
Phantom lost by 45 sec cause he spent 20 min looking for magical seed 2 which was in tubba basement.
Also it was required quadruple dip chapter 3
triple necessary dip in Chapter 3
Adam wound up quintuple dipping it lmao
it was literally 1 pergression item per sphere
damn, that's a lot of spheres
Adam is prohibited from making seeds going forward /lh
well progressiona ctually stops at 11
is it the first time any player of even Sacred Ghosts calibur to quad dip a place?
what fresh hell is this trick :V
Antiguy isn't technically in logic until you get the cookbook, yeah?
is getting the chest without beating anti-guy a glitched logic option?
how's the MMBN4 speedrun coming along?
gotta say, BN4 felt like a huge stepdown from 3
And now we finally in go mode
well you gotta vote them 2nd and 3rd to get maximum ground for the one of the other 3 that you want :P
And now for a baby crystal king
yeah, wed use it to decide rando settings
how awful would an all glitches logic rando be?
how good are you at LZS?
ah okay then yeah that'd be very difficult.
what do you mean, you're not a computer and can't do the easiest double frame perfect input Phantom? For shame /lh
120 consecutive LZS jumps that is
Rain's just built different (like a computer)
I know Mark used to run RAC
Thanks for the stream and enjoy the rest of your day
@Rgamer0 shoulda stalled for 13 more seconds for even more
