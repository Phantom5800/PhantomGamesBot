omg i love kirby64 so much
i'm here for the kirby yeeting
*looks at the mess behind her* i mean i guess cleaning up is fine
i see it as more lived in than messy lmao
dragon fruit has been my addiction ever since I got it
I only remember from Brawl Dedede
Just left me scarred enough to fucking hate Kirby games
This game probably has the best selection of copy abilities
Even tho star allies is my favorite, I still love every single kirby game
He's gonna become an artist streamer
I think Adventure introduced that or Super Star I don't remember well
Cutter in DR3 and 64 is kinda bad by itself
how is it 100% if you dont get all the info cards Kappa
Just die, it turns into 01, and you win
is this your first kiirby speedrun?
the combine system is cool af
Can't wait for the dynamite level
I've always thought about running this but never have
One day Seasons will happen jaycFeels
I think the coolest ability is Cutter plus spark
i like bomb and cutter a lot - the ninja star haha
was it bomb and cutter or spark and cutter?
My personal favorite is Cutter+Bomb, with Ice+Spark being a close second
Very unfair and way too long
how did you enjoy rock + cutter? (the shape changer shard mission thing)
I feel you should've got a HP refill when Dedede took control
howd you get to dry dry ruins?
already at the start of the new yr ur now my fave streamer
world 2 in every game ever
Stone+Cutter is cool cause you only use pitch
oh this one is fun too
Ice+Fire is the best combine copy ability stickshamChaos
Isnt there that 1 level in fire planet(forgot the name)where you need double ice for a crystal star
Yeah, 2x of me sounds really fuckin toxic
ice cut is good too, ice skating I think?
Needle I feel in 64 has a ton of utility with all combinations
Doesn't save you from the 2 second timeouts
Is this run going on the youtubes?
it’s a weird room yes. one thing that helps with the jumps is if you’re running to the left before jumping, it allows for faster horizontal movement
oh def. this room ain’t easy. it was a TAS only trick for a while PrideLaugh
I forget lightbulb is an ability
Forgotten Land isn't a real game
Someone needs to make that an animated emote
I think Fire+Spark is funny but it's bad
fire+spark is my fav combo just for the animation PrideLaugh
Pix is such a strange boss
fuck, now you’re making me want to run this again lol
"Do you think Geoff has ever heard of Ghost Trick?" First reply is "he thinks its an indie game. KEKW
lol they had to get the last hit
How do you perfect frame that lol
like a frame or two later
Phantom, you should learn BM64 with me
new game, still shitty spear guy enemies
Perfect opportunity to do it then lol
the way I started remembering easy was with Curtis. when you get to the small waterfalls, count “1, 2, 3” in the lollipop owl voice and you’ll know exactly where it is PrideLaugh
28 means you purposely manipped rng to make it go further PrideLaugh
Strange parasol isn't in this game
so i take it this is fishing?
Yes Stavros this is adult fishing
Never knew this as a kid
i never knew about the fish :O
i never knew til I learned this run LOL
i only lifted them up like that for meat shield lol
Don't most enemies have a special property like that?
I would assume the spear guy is one of them?
if you want bomb for Acro, 2-4 in the beginning, the rocket enemy
also, did you know Acro spelled backwards is Oil Spill?
i mean technically by this game, this is your second fight LOL
I don’t remember this part of Sea World
yeahh, now the run is about to get fucking hard
Wdym, isn't that an everyday occurrence?
Why did it just let you drop like that?
I remember using the Bird and using to glide across
I just learned that Mother3 has a book of mario translation
but yeah, it’s still ridiculous how they have you do this
Don't you know, when you actually are speedrunning, nothing goes your way?
because you have to carry ice through the entire stage as well
hold up, YOU DOING CURLING STONE STRATS: 👀
it’s parasol, top hat, or pizza
parasol worst luck, pizza(?) for best luck
Is hat the best one to get?
i just know parasol is worst LOL
oh boy I hope it crashes!
yo did i hear vc crashes Pog
you can eat those rocks too
I guess we take that L
yeah, sparky’s a lil bitch in this level
yeah, that’s what I meant PrideLaugh
yeahh, you can moonwalk if you’d like
or climb up the stairs without your sprite moving LMAO
Fond memories of renting this game from Blockbuster
what's this I heard from the other side of my room about swallowing
good luck against the most terrifying bosses ever... a D20
It's so funny how ass burn kirby is in this game compared to every other LOL
nice you got fire at last
it’s pretty rare in general without manip
Why blud got a bandaid on his head who put that there
so fun thing about this fight, I believe you can use the L and R buttons as well
popesPOGGERS_HF minimi6Pog ghunzoEPOGna tippiPog popesPOGGERS_SG phanto274GG jcogGERSC qwilliPauggie jcogGERS
it’s one of those things you just have to try out, not during a run though
yeah, this game has a high technical skill level
this is kinda peaking my interest
it’s why I had to stop
hol up, kirby has a copy ability??
@JamminJami any of the swords or rock statues
some based kirby crystal shard gaming
as for my fave being a bomb and op fire fire(living comet)
Part of me wishes i actually learned this game
I was thinking about it like until manip came out and then stopped haha
Thats fair, for when you need a break from Rando?
Well... this ain't mario 🤔 phanto274GL
So I can redeem another pape rando?
damb did I miss the run
Okay I can't make them myself too many settings 🤣 but if I leave in notes is that fine again?
game overs are bad and unfair and never ever happen in this game
you say that as if majority of all artists don't do porn
Max rando no access to prologue or chapter 7. Cheap or low cost bp/fp badges etc and hopefully glitchless 😁
No rush I have a roof here to get fixed and clean up after that 🥴
I should see about porting Rock Star to MMR again
I had instruments and stuff figured out, just a matter of editing
It actually sounds super good in the MM soundfont
Kirby is the most talented nonbiney of all time
i remember this game being so hard
yeah it’s easy to do alongside the moonwalking
Everyone always says this game is so hard and I go ????
the final boss is no joke and some of the combo powerups are hard to figure out in places
but it may be one of those like
'I grew up with the game how can it be hard' deals
this game is medium strength at best it tests ur knowledge/skill/ platforming
from a speedrunning perspective I can absolutely see how this game is rough
eh, i can see how it would be hard for some.  I wouldnt say its hard as much as it can punish you for real for making mistakes
I enjoy him in theory but playing him is like running in Fatal Frame
Now I wanna play Kirby 64
*this* was the bastard piece for me growing up
I need a Kirby Jam emote tbh
all Kirby songs are pretty much bangers
The stage 2 forest theme sounded more like a Christmas tune
Me when I'm below u and my beak is pointy B>
happy new year! im doing good, i hope you are doing well
Hey I beat this recently jcogLurk
THAT'S how you get that shard??
to know that, you would literally have to play Kirby’s Dream Land 3
i transformed myself into a rock! I'm rocky rick!!
Maybe it's cause I played Ecco and Majora's Mask but it's more like widevibe than anything else
I’m glad they weren’t that evil at least LUL
IDT it's on this channel but it's a bunny moving with its arms back and forth
This level was eating my ass before
one of things off that pull starting off is not to jump off but go all the way down on the pole and then press right to let go
Second hardest in the game imo
I thought the fight would be over after that first phase
look, sometimes you just gotta fish with dynamite
well maybe the endangered species shouldn't have played fuck around and find out
They even attack bougie ships come on now
It was fun doing this without an ability afterward lol
people who cannot hold their breath or are mute cannot
or wait maybe it’s go all the way down the pole and then press down at the bottom. i can’t remember
The spiders are the worst sometimes
It doesn’t help that it takes so long to get too
yeah this is a real dangerous power up
esp given you can't really duck to bring out ur hard helmet
Rock bomb is the dynamite right?
I wanna put Kirby in my mouth and I hope he tastes like bubble gum
they gotta make the game last longer so....artificial padding
Considering this game can be finished without glitches in like 4-5 hours, yea
They clearly did it to force players to replay previous levels
Don’t talk about their balls like that
Yo, Phantom. Happy New Year, chat! nagPeepohappy
Just 30 more days of Kirby zfgSad
Bold of you to think I even pay attention
Can we get to part where I just teach you Luigi’s Mansion 100% instead? zfgSmug
I regret selling Luigi's Mansion 😔 But I had beat it so many times....
That reminds me weren't the waddles enemies?
All my homies hate Kirby zfgMad
I didn’t realize you could protect yourself from that
That ability is high key ass tho
watch out for the weaponized bird turds
I know there’s one in world 3?
when did you start Playing Super Metroid
Fire cutter probably the most fun ability imo
Is this game just annoying to run?
It'd be so fuckin hella if it was like 1.5x faster
Honestly that ability is down there just above dynamite for me LUL
Like, you’d think it would at least be fast
Hated this level just for the crystal shard at the end
This one in particular was really bad for me
man i just love the coolness of this lvl
really interested to see how a speedrun of this goes
this game is good and fair
It's basically those castles from Super Mario World
Died at least 5 or 6 times just to crushers
This game do have the banger music
@buff00n the run is fine to me
now you got me wanting to try a 100% speedrun of this too
learning which moves you need to get the gems
yeah, this run takes a ton of practice
interesting, yeah your right i wouldent of guessed that LUL
it’s one of, if not the most, technical Kirby games
Jacob's playing ash so he's the hero
i never would of guessed, i wanna do it just becaues i love this game LUL
oh god i DESPISE THIS BOSS
So fun fact. This boss is the reason I purchased this game on the Wii U eshop.
Endgame is upon us and Levias is epic!
Since I never beat it as a kid LUL
just got straight up DVD Screen'd
this boss always gives me such a hard time
It took me forever to beat this as a lad lol
I lost track of the sub goal someone help me remember
Sub goal met party time all!
what does the purple block thing do?
Hey its void- I mean 02
I was obsessed with the mini games tho
and star rail just railed me again Sadge
Yes bc all biblically accurate angels have giant green spikey dicks
wait we did not hit the sub goal?
honestly no one cares for any% LOL
Whispy will still be the same. outside of that I’m not sure
Yo somebody gifted me a sub earlier, THANK YOU
I was going to prime when I got mine lol but grateful for the sub @str9ngest9r monadoHug
Double fire all the way across the sky
yknow double fire being the speedrun move of choice makes sense LUL
iirc it’s faster a bit to single fire this run, but you also don’t wnt dead hands PrideLaugh
Yo thanks for the gift sub @LordLevias19 ! phanto274Jam
Kirby squeak squad was a really good game
I love getting Wegmans muffins. Blueberry and their Doble chocolate are my go tos
Kirby air ride was great as well
some muffins has chocolate that tastes like ink
It's a grocery chain in select areas of the ne.
have you tried honkai star rail yet?
double fire so op beyond belief jaye
Also Im very annoyed bc Ive been trying to do my fafsa for the past week and the site has been in maintenance this whole week
I'm a ny local and it's my fave store, but I don't drive and can only go if a friend takes me. So I usually end up walking to dollar general
Oh, thanks for the sub mossro1Popop phanto274BLANKIES
Not me dying to the first pillar on this level monadoPAUSE
Are there any differences aside from the crystal shards?
Is there a run that requires all the cards?
oh that would be diabolical KEKW
people have done true 100% before. collecting all the cards doesn’t take too long
but it’s more rare I believe
What do the cards even do?
when I did it, I got mostly new ones
and you’ll know if it’s new or not because Kirby reacts differently
what the name of this boss fight again
the dp off the reflector was OD
honestly do not blame you lol
kirby kills everyone whos stands in his way rionavKnife
and he gets praised for it
Wordle 926 4/6*  ⬛🟨🟨⬛⬛ ⬛🟨⬛⬛🟨 🟩⬛🟩🟩⬛ 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
here comes kirby reigning fiery vengeance
you're getting gold splits, that's all that matters Kappa
"Player 2 FINALLY takes a round!" rub it in, asshole
i'm pretty sure this is the type of game where you can get a good time w/ mostly game knowledge alone
Kirby, master of the good ol suck-n-swallow
i love this cute little guy
Kirby how would you like it if someone broke into your house n throws bombs on you
he's just trying to cook you up
I tried out the demo of this, terry is really fun to play. I was getting excited doing quarter circles with my fight stick lol
submit them and then come back after you've got a wr and compare xD
I was like, I get now, I know why people use fight sticks
it's like learning taxes for the first time
i liked the grind for manips in Pokemon but i don't know that i'd want to do that for multiple games :)
just need to get that ace any% skip down
at least it's not arbitrary ;)
Couldn't learn how to consistently grab but when it happened I'd pop off lol
I learned a couple of alttp glitches for an any% and then decided i didn't like the speedrun
i like the music in this game - wonder why i've never ran it before
the boss that can crash on runs
I love the random witch just chillin in hte bg
I don't know what that game is
You're not doing enough Brian Copters
i hated this level as a kid lol
That crusher can eat my ass
It’s mainly getting crushed on the corners that’s triggering
It kinda sucks you can’t guard in this game
I couldn’t tell if you just walked into it or not
I'm not gonna be playing SMRPG for a while. Gotta derust CV3
Yeah, I didn't read much lmao
We also now fight Dodo KEKW
I'll let them cook on that for a couple weeks
They got rid of jump shoes johnny at least
Oh so, I think we're just gonna roll with 5 people in the room
And maybe not do the upgrade
I think it's a standard double room
This is my favorite track in the game
Hotel cost is looking around 308ish if I calc'd tax right
why hotel bunk in with a local gamer
Kirby still cosplaying Pikachu from Smash Bros on the 64
'rude ass pix' me yelling about my art in the bg'
when does the rng manip start :)
had a funny moment at work early
customer was trying to opt out of text messages but all they sent was "stop fucking"
i'm ace i'm way ahead of you
i love that stone kine is literally useless
like he doesn't even get "swim slowly"
her leg really just went through najd's little poke
i need to remember really funny things can happen to athena when far d whiffs
its still not a great far c
i just didnt know it was cancelable lmao
I'm now inside so i can actually watch
we are clawing our way back
with how often yurikov does missed light confirm>oops i'll throw now i really should be mashing on hit more (it works against us every time so why wouldn't he lmao)
bind the touchpad to roll tho
keep 2 hands on the wheel at all times
Also I'm unsure if it's my end or not, my net looks fine but stream has been stuttery
we gotta get more sand characters in FGs. Kukri is dope
we gotta get more sand characters in Butts. Kukbutt is dope
we gotta get more sand in my butt
does his pillow have a name?
This is the level where I got pissed at the game
Keep in mind I was like 6 years old at the time
What if you made Brian Copter an emote?
small character easy link lets go
I thought you had some save in World 6
A death in 5-3, lost some power up in 6
but hes probably gonna do kyo k iori
he do be throwing it back
hmm maybe this ggy knows how to kof
the athena timeouts we're nasty tho
what am i even looking at lmao
Kooper and goombario got your back?  well this is over already lol
can you get back to toad town?
LUL what is happening?!? also hi also also gl
unfortunately many adults would do that LOL
so is this a full on mod or just like a small game?
is the toad who you trade candy stars with?
did 54 attempts at jr troopa segment and finally got a 3:22
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
Maybe the crying animation is weirdly long on console or something
what in the fuck is the grass
I like that a lot LOL
all these misses make me think it’s the opposite of master quest Kappa
Twitch took my money yesterday, but I couldn't send this message until today
I mean, you also could cheat
I feel like I back seated when I shouldn't have LUL
ummm excuse me… this isn’t the sewers
What's so "sweet" about this expedition
but he has no ears 🤔
Man that was a touching finale.
Can you hit it from below?
the dev is calling it shit NODDERS
Now I will finish you you bitch swifSleep
One of these days this account will be banned I swear KEKW
That much stop time is also too much
What was your first run btw? Just curious
What did they find this time now
And it also depends on how much you save
Because if it's like 20s just, no
I'd say don't change it KEKW too much hassle
Yeah because resources change and you need a new management and command chain
Remind me to bother you about mcr shit if I get curious
this music makes me want to march tho
well i was talking about the jungle music :)
sounds like one of the mana franchise tho
I miss the cow already Sadge
i suppose they can have their opinion lol
Last time I had that kind of comment I bothered the fuck outta them doing it
I have rolling muscle memory embedded into my brain
And if you say stop glitching you know what happens next phanto274Smile
I don't always pay super close attention to Zelda randos but did I choose a reasonable pred?
It's around the same time frame my randos get bomb bag or bow so swifLove you good
I know both can happen where you go forever without a sword or get a bunch up-front
You do in fact have a bunch of non-sword key items already though so we'll see
getting it done the right way
you like it that much huh
hey! the rando I woted on today. Cant be mad if it loses the poll now LUL
how was pape? saw I missed the first hour and a half and didnt want to tune in then
partner with poison status sounds cool
well thats all I know LUL
but do you have dance unlocked?
I knew id forget so thats why I sent it
At least you won't run out of bombs any time soon now.
I'm just waiting for your one of your next few checks to be another sword upgrade.
That would be just my luck. Personally. XD
This seed really wants you to blow stuff up, apparently.
I want my bs hamtaro speedrun
Now I'm thirsty for a soda pop, brb.
The good news in a race, everyone would have to come back here eventually, not just you.
Does that mean we aren't out of logic anymore?
I don't know this game as well as some others. XD
It would have been really gross if that was where flippers was.
Personally, I never actually compete in races, but I do sometimes do race seeds on my own just for fun.
I couldn't handle the pressure in an actual race though.
Link is a healthy boy this seed.
twas good! i'm quite liking it
You should celebrate when you move in by leaving your dishes out and getting a dog
and it's got music up there with dark souls 3
It's weird cause I've never gotten into the actual SoulsBorn games but between Lies of P and Star Wars Jedi I have been interested in quite a few games of that style. It's weird.
i still need to get jedi survivor
i love each and every boss in the dark souls game. I only made a tier list for Elden Ring
I've even took a good look at Elden Ring a few times
Lies of P my fave is Metal Knight Jester Giant.
i enjoyed elden ring until the end game
yeah, everything post leyndell were painful
1. Dragon armed (forgot spelling) 2. Ghost Lion Man (forgot spelling again) 3. Enchanted Mega deer (cant spell)
That caterpillar sounded like a Pokemon trainer humping a wall
Honorable mention with the twin aspect is the golden duo both (fat and skinny)
I made it with ground beef and diced mushrooms
I mean seasoning is important so it doesn't taste like shit or bland
I think beef (or steak chunks) and shrooms works causes the meat ends up overpowering the mushrooms most of the time
mushrooms and onions over shadow meats.
Phantom if I purchased lethal company for you would you play it with me and proc
that's better then we'll die together
how fast will we swing today
but it could be your dollar
as long as i don't need to specify the use of the bomb
Avoiding Castor Wilds at all costs.
Something tells me the shop lady is holding this seed hostage.
I wonder what the thumbnail will be this time? So many things it could be. XD
Once it's worthy you'll get the other
do you have a final goal in mind for this game?
what are times like on snes?
yeah, was curious how close they are
we are set to rock this
at least jp bn runners dont include credits LUL
btw the answer to your question from the other day, only JP version of Pape does watt do extra damage in lava
well that's something to enter during lol
GL with run yo, im bout to start spm any% PB attempts
I beat the fnaf thing I was doing last night
I have been attempting the hardest challenge in the game and I havent even got past the 1st 20 seconds
50/20 mode in UCN, you need inhuman levels of reaction time and patients
One of the fuckers lingers in the office and my mouse goes over it for 0.8 seconds I lose
customer comes in, asks if a question is grammatically correct, i confirm it is and ask if they have any product-related questions. they then ask me a prompt to write their landing page about one thing but also mentioning another
so i explain what i'm actually there for, ask again if there's product-related questions i can assist with
and then they ask "are you a real person"
i respond that yes i am indeed a real person
and they say "oh my bad I thought you were an AI"
an N64 controller would be great to use for emulating Wonderswan, since that has effectively 2 D-pads and then 2 face buttons
you mean you never played the LEGENDARY EXE GAME?!?
you mean you don't wanna play BATTLE CHIP CHALLENGE but WORSE?!?
seriously tho BCC is based on N1 Battle, BCC fixed up a LOT of things
BCC isn't that bad honestly, could be better but it's neat. there is the Chip Control Mod now
which makes it even more fun
instead of it being RNG which route is taken you get to actually choose that route
but yeah looking at N1 battle...
Dang, Osu is such a  good game
you only get Lan's story, there's 108 chips total, only 20 navis, no Slot In, chips go based on speed instead of selection order, rows are reversed, and no panel changing
so if you set your folder a certain way those chips will always go in that way, which is kinda boring lmao
geno where the fuck were you standing to fall like that
Look at this boss, button mashing!
I hope you like dumb jokes because I'm full of them
no i want you to run the game with even OLDER strats, play the game like it's the SNES original Kappa
no not play the game on snes, play the remake as if it is the same speedrun as the snes one
why does that house have a turbine attached to it
i don't see power lines in the mushroom kingdom!
Yo Phantom, gl with the new route!
Tiny Master Chief could fit in this game's aesthetic
Have you tried not having a 5 turn fight?
Oh you do fake chomp over hurly?
I guess it just takes too much time to unlock real chomp and too much money to get hurly gloves
Just use that money on margs
(all compared to the time those weapons would save)
Twitch is weird and messing up my anniversaries but anyways hello phanto274Smile
Oh it didn't even play the alert phanto274Lurk
That sounds like a lame place to reset too
The cake is bad enough too
This song is gonna be burned in my brain
I mean, I'd join you for the BN2 rando
I wouldn't suggest it without joining phanto274Smile
I can't believe you'd hurt me like this
That's what the dollar sign is for
something like A$1 means "keep it in column A"
and B$3$ means "keep it on cell B3"
oh, I forgot the dollar sign needs to be before the column letter or row number
Baja blast is only available at Walmart near me, and I'll be damned if I go to Walmart jsrSad
bring the walmart onto your property
Delivery around here is like another 13 dollars
no moar Baja Blast at Taco Bell, or is it more like no Taco Bell nearby either
Nah it's 20th anniversary of it, so it's available to purchase all of 2024
You just gotta go to walmart apparently
Which I'd rather snap my ankle in 20 places before I set foot into a walmart
closest baja blast to me is a dollar general on the highway
it's one of the newer dollar generals too
Closest dollar general to me is in the bad part of town phanto274Smile
(For reference, I live in New Orleans)
yeah thst's a dont go there for sure
unless it's also an iffy walmart
You could always grab the 50 chest before shaman skip
If you're short coins for nimbus
Do me a favor, go to 2-1 for me
Mf the only Kirby game you play
Nintendo was putting health and safety warnings on all their games but it wasnt enough to keep a generation from becoming myopic losers with all sorts of health issues
Do you do any of the glitches?
No the heck way my fave game of all all alll time!
Want me to teach you super jumps?
I can show you at GDQ
I have a 1:03 in this game lmao
Goomba surfing ruined the run for me phanto274Smile
i know how to get to 8th dungeon without mirror shield and get the key to the 3rd dungeon without doing the side quest
The best opening of any video game
you sure this hard logic? Analyze
This game, seasons and ages are just so fucking good
God damn you're gonna be in go mode in like 10 minutes
ok so this looking like very easy logic to me
I feel embarrassed to say I didn't play this game until it got ported to switch
i played this all the time back on my gameboy sp
i don't think i had the og gameboy version
It was GB for LA, GBC for LADX, and Switch
gameboy color version had boomerang and the color dungeon
Not a glitch, but it's a trick
Oh maybe you can enter D2
i left and came back and we are kirby in zelda? lol nice
you can tell this is an old kirby game because he doesn't have a hat with sword
I like the pac man noise when you fall into a pit
You can't pit walk that far
so what dumb settings did you choose for this
Oh I looked away and you got powder. How'd you do it
I'll take your word for it Kappa
it take you to the start of the game
try it maybe i am wrong haven't played this in year
yes L and R. two buttons known for being on the GB
it's A B Start Select on the main screen
Can't you lift signs in this game with power bracelet?
Rip. Another change added in seasons/ages
I know in seasons, you got a ring for breaking so many signs LUL
flying rooster is just an item in this i love it
okay now get Cutter and ride Coo, you'll kill everything
Maybe click bow wow a few times?
but you can't use him in dungeons so
who let kirby have a sword
this went from goish to struggle in a matter of minutes
You can dash into him with sword
what if this guy have the feather
i can see this for hard logic but not normal logic tf
heck, maddy put our I Can't Feel My Face pepper flake blend in the spaghetti sauce
WAS THAT A CHEST FROM D4
the flower is for the hippo in animal village iirc
last time i play this game i didn't do the trade quest
I'm trying to think what else you have open
Try and do the yellow things that aren't in dungeons
isn't bee hive guy north here
You can use the bird to fly over the swimming spot
And gain access to the Eagle Key spot
What do you need a bomb for
Or mambo's brings you to Crazy Tracys
All you have to do is enter the screen
With the teleporters and it unlocks them
You can also go up the stairs
That leads to the cave with the Eagle Key
i had a seed where it expected me to owl everywhere so many places
There's an item in this cave
so i know exactly what you can do with it
you can get almost to turtle rock with the owl
also i'm so used to seeing coo already i'm calling the rooster the owl lmfao
How many seashells do you have
iirc there's a cave under those rocks
I'm trying to see what I can figure out
is it one of the rocks i was trying to point out lol
The cave you're talking mirby is a mad batter
yeah but that cuold be something
You have rooster so you can float to it
Are mad batters in logic too?
Cause the chest you opened on the west side
i think they got bow wow from a mad batter
Can you send me a screenshot of your map?
So I can see what you've checked
you can bomb the bottom wall in this room but it's just rupees as we saw
i know you don't have bombs right now
this is a spot i ALWAYS forget about (it's a piece of heart in vanilla)
also the flower goes to a hippo in a house in animal village
Oh and the yellow box at the bottom
You can fly the rooster too
It'll bring you straight to Richard's villa
I think he takes the hibiscus
u got to be shitting me
If you wanna do one of these at GDQ, I can show you stuff
idk what's up with the tracker
Do you need the 5 leaves in this?
So you set a respawn point
Better hope you get instrument room
alright we schmoving and gettin  on now
Well. You found the beak last. Wonder what the owl says LUL
The hitbox on the final boss slime
That's gonna have most checks, yeah
High chance you'll find a dungeon key there
It's 15 shells for the koholint sword, I think
Oh you found the secret zelda portion of Kirby 64, most people don't know about it
carolina reaper, moruga scorpion, ghost pepper, and habanero flake blend
You have to push the graves a specific way
5th grave down, 4th grave left, 1st grave up, 2nd grave right, 3rd grave up
It didn't space my numbers lmao
ice it's your favorite dungeon theme
hit them throw in right hole
that's to the quadruplets in mabe
Okay that goes to the baby in mabe
All you get is a bag of "stuff"
I wonder what's gonna be in the arcade this time at GDQ
What trade quest items do you have
also no lie if u chose red tunic after the boss I would unfollow. KEKW so they were randoed as well.
That opens up quite a few checks
The last item in Dick's Villa
Me and that Walrus are one and the same
Bomb the north wall in the fall room
Wish I could bomb a wall and find 50 bucks
i am very sick and looking for fun vibes. am i in the right place?
There's a bomb wall on the east wall
okay ill be holding you to that. if kirby dies im holding you personally responsible
i'd probably also drop my bong if you killed me though
Mine is a rare drop aspen
You gotta kill me multiple times
hope u've got some lives saved up then
I got somewhere between 6 and 9 of them
Using 5 of them at AGDQ
All that does is let you read the books in the library lol
The rando didn't change it to 1 leaf
Yeah remember that cave you went too on the far right?
Oh yeah you have red tunic
what the fuck you don't have PoP
It's all the same item LUL
You only gotta open 1 box
Sure wish I could duplicate 50 dollars
i want the key to the $50 room.........
back to the south part of the map
what the fuck is this rando
Yo he's walking on water kirby is god
Well now you have TONS to do
Kirby in the water kinda looks like a Kabuto
I need to go fishing where he's fishing
where are these quest npcs in real life?
I THINK THEY TOOK MORE THAN THE NECKLACE LADY
u are kirby can't u just float over it
i guess you'll just have to tape them to your body to kill enemies that run into ut hem
Did you get the very first chest
The hookshot one in room 2
You have no more chests lol
i dont think that revenge was what he had in mind
if that's his idea of revenge. im going to get a job at his favorite diner and spit in his soup
I wish someone would revenge that on me
all that for some dog food
u could also give it to ice it sounds like
what's ur quest reward for the dog food turn in?
no i mean the reward ice would give u
I would Ara Ara in your ear
There's a heart piece in the water
It's the guy up there that says he's tired and needs "vittles"
So he can throw it away instead of putting it on pizza
well you can full clear it with pb2
You're getting violated by this seed lmao
You gonna be able to make it to GDQ?
"I hear Phantom finally found the eagle key"
You should be able to stun them with Hook
So let me teach you a trick
Clip 1 pixel into the wall by walking as close as possible to the wall but enough so link can still walk
Then Feather and face into the wall at the same time then at the apex of the jump, press the opposite direction
Wow look at all those dollars you have
I have sleepy time medicine and chocolate
Jump and push into the wall then immediately press the other direction
At the apex press the other direction
So at the very top of the jump press left
I think when you initially jump you should be pushing into the wall
Then at the top of it change directions
Why is lmao censored on mobile???
Does twitch think I'm like.  9?
I just got the mulldozer clip on youtube LUL
First kirby64 now I see you running Kirby's Other Dream Land... You know, cause Link's Awakening is a dream... tough crowd phanto274Shrug
Ill be disappointed if you didnt name your file Kirby
Then at the top of the jump
Slash and press the other direction
The slash and other direction are the same frame
You just did it, but the statue pushed you lmao
Try maybe a bit before you reach the highest apex
You can jump over obstacles in dungeons with it
Okay so it's fast inputs when you do it
It basically tricks the game into thinking link is on a ledge
You can't clip into that though
Clip into the wall, jump and push into the wall itself, then once link gets close to the top, slash and press the opposite direction at the same time
I keep thinking it's super late for you, but it's like 10pm lol
Oh btw, if you wanna save quit to warp back to the front of dungeons
Should also have a home warp
If you press down twice I think
yo ice, did you heard BN LC is finally getting added to the leader board KEKW
what happens if you run out of bombs in this room?
2024 is truly a great year
I think the save quit menu also has a hidden option
phantom, I saw the funniest suggestion in the discord. Make volume 1 one game and volume 2 another game OMEGALUL
And the room north of the staircase exit
Oh they actually added the home option
When I last played it was an invisible menu LOL
It turns the anti fairys into fairies
You have d1 and d4 now
So in the speedrun we use the super jump
I'm lying to you in cold blood
when is Kirby in TMC rando?
are instruments added to the pool?
oh dang, I just noticed the timer
does switch verrsion have a rando too?
that would prob be my only reason to get a mig switch
the shark boss from kirby 64
I expected kirby to fly in on his warp star there KEKW
There's 9 fucking keys here wtf
you can super jump that block
Slash and face the other direction at the same time
these salsa verde doritos are fire
Since when is a Zelda rando generous
I've also heard this was one of the fun but as you're experiencing, potential to be hell
I've said it before, one thing is knowing the game and another knowing the logic
Oh I know, I loved tmc boots
Letter is the house right after woods
She just admitted to robbing a bank
My favorite pile of shit dungeon
Pls use magic rod it's op
You have the KNOB of destiny
I'm so stoked, I thought I needed to buy more pairs of pants for AGDQ cause I could only find 2 pairs
I went digging in the closet and found 3 more pairs that fit me
Ayyy you know the speed strats lmao
have a good night guys, 2am is my limit lol
will you be playing this hard logic again?
you need a jailbreak switch right
link looking kinda different in this game asachiTweethinks
i got subchips for half off
if you have BN2 in the GBA slot (or the game tricked into thinking you do via codes) you unlock a special subchip shop which sells FullEnrg, Unlocker, and LocEnemy chips for half off
game even says it's because subchips started in BN2
You can technically damage boost through the fire
If you clip into the left wall
Kinda like how you do a super jump
Just clip in, and dash up
Hard logic probably allows for the damage boost
Yeah but you gotta clip at the bottom of it
You don't need to dash this screen
just get a potion and die up there
i always do 8 before 7
hope so i should be in Bedge rn
Cover the whole floor for a chest there
@Iceblue i was thinking that but wasn't sure been years since i played this
how nice of that hinox to throw you at the exit
trendy game was in the entrance to eagle tower
how many points to make you do full er and key sanity?
i am close to half a mil points
You have to go read it
thought it was static til you looked
In rando? I don't think it is
dear lord all those long-ass times we got on jay's command just came true here, ice
btw i had a funny moment of exiting a battle before the voice clip finished so i had the effect of colonel going YOU ARE SKI
its 3 am i hope its not another run
good job phantom YOU ARE SKI
phantom question for you. who the fuck would use a LongSwrd E
fuck no, thursdays are my day off
it's not friday till i go to bed
i misspoke, it was a LongBlde E
Which is Quest 64, but on GB
yeah i learned about that looking at the retroachievements games, ice
i was like WAIT THERE'S QUEST 64 GB??!?
Do we have a redo of last night here?
i gotta try one of these one day
ive only every played ladx like once though lol
Yo there's easier settings for Phantom?
Is there still a pit jump?
So we doing an entrance rando at GDQ?
No bring back Pokémon BR, put it on the switch
It's not like I'm sleeping anyway
i see that ice is also a gacha enjoyer
Nah just your average runescape enjoyer blacktiger
What a time to come home with dinner
@Iceblue i see envi does have nice emotes tho
Did the rando have a quality downgrade or What ? (Kidding, I only played the Switch Version)
I've been subbed to envi since he had like 20k followers lmao
doesn't he have like 300k now
"Subscribed to Enviosity for 87 months with a current streak of 87 month."
I love paying the ultimate price
87 months damn i found out about him in 2020 cuz you know genshin
I also play genshin now lmao
is this the only zelda game where you can steal lol
Majora's Mask you could also steal
@Iceblue can i add you on genshin? i can help you out if u need it
You steal rupees and a hotel room from a goron lol
his fault for having the same name as you though
I'll post my UID in phantom's discord in the gaming channel
Identity theft is a bigger crime than robbery
i really should get back to adding people lol
I primarily play runescape, but i do log into genshin sometimes too
ok @Iceblue i added you if u ever need help hit me up
No way in a dungeon in UNDER 5 MINUTES
Oh sweet, Song of Soaring Kappa
Is this palutena or an I trippin
If I'm dumb just say so
Who let the bot write for the randomizer? KEKW
I think LASW would've been a better remake if they did more outside of a few QoLs and funny dungeon maker
see phantom just found you that's how nuts you are
hit the switch while you're on top of the blue buttons
NOTED logic for this game is kinda dumb
i can't believe ice just murdered phantom
Shovel only work season and ages
Tiny Doritos are cute and tasty. Just a little PSA
Oooo this is a different tracker from last night
Based on last night's run, seems like that map was a pile of asses
Ugh, this was something LASW did right, put Power Bracelet and Boots on their own button
Damn I haven't played audiosurf in years
song is too short to medal
I used to love getting baked and playing audiosurf
i once did a full 40 minute long song in audiosurf too
You are too op early on with the rod
Where you literally lag the game so bad, bosses don't spawn
I'd like to get a body door installed in my house
i mean he's just borgar so eat him
I'm assuming OG rod is like Hard ore for seasons? @iceblue LUL
No it does the same thing here
The game wasn't built to handle the sprite limit
So the game just mega lags with the fire rod shots on screen
And the lag is so bad the bosses just don't spawn
And you walk to the instrument rooms LUL
Make a puka shell necklace phanto274Thonk
At this rate make some ear rings as well
im back with pizza how is X doing?
i didn't know about the color dungeon till the remake came out
btw, if you're ever low on hearts
that has to feel good after last night
yes it's been stuck in my mind for 30 years
i love how the gator eats the dog food can and all
enjoyed the vod and i saw u chose red
Let the routing and thinking begin
Apparently the tracker is on top of the raid alert
talking about why big streamers ignore small streamers
Link’s Awakening with lots of Mario references
The color dungeon was the DX secret dungeon ? I think
Lots of keys and lots of maps
its not like you need a red tunic with a magic rod
Hmm idk where the switch is
you just got that necklace frm the last dungeon right?
why is a fish in an egg on a mountain?
@venturific i think in my mind its not an egg but a skull.
with the dots being blood stains. and the true maze of evil.
@stavros12c34anenoglou but then why is it in a skull? whoevers dream this is they are fed up!!
Well seeing as how this is my N1 FortOne popesOne_TK Zelda game in history i have my own head canon.

i am liking watching this rando
oh yeah agdq is soon LETSGO
i voted for pokemon early this week
honestly i think you should play what you want, i was the one who just voted and i could watch any of them
my dad was watching you play the zelda rando
he doesn’t use youtube for that stuff lol
i cant believe it im a mon!
fun fact I nicknamed my vehicle Black Pearl.
so this is kinda fitting me being a pirate fan as well
Y'all ever just sit around and eat way more pineapple than you should
literally me last night liquid lol
@str9ngest9r I'm being absurd right now. I've eaten almost a whole pineapple. But even better, from the comfort of my bed LUL
You cant just say Lugia doesn't have any rizz like that
Also I was looking back through the food posts in discord because I'm weird. But I appreciate you bc you use hexclad cookware
I would get some but MAN are they pricey
I just use a generic non stick pan, but it works surprisingly well for 40$
People fuck up by using metal utensils when cooking stuff
Forks, knives etc in the pan
swift start is a worrisome endish
I think I say this every time I watch a crystal playthrough, but this OST is probably one of my favorites
Yeah he's got balls for ya
Slugma used to look so bad hahahahaha
Not the Eevee I wouldve chose but its fine
Well this isn't the mario rando I redeemed Sadge but phanto274GL
Which is Monday for me and I have a plasterer coming to rip out a room and redo Madge
If only they were chicken nuggets
It got flooded bad on new years 🥴 after being hit by tornado like storms christmas day
Damn now we have to watch out for flying clams??
liquid is now a water dragon!
FUCK yes. I'm a shining sea serpent
oh shit am I the Vioplume? I didnt even notice
Can key items end up in GAMBA ?
Probably for the best it's not default LUL
yt to a comment I posted - "YOU KNOW I HATE GENO AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY BECAUSE GENO IS A REAL BADASS:
wow, rando loves loading up enemies w/ electric moves whenever you run a flying type
something about Pallos being a Lass is just... correct
This moltres really wanted to fuse with his triplets.
I think I have the first one wrong tho
Have we seen any of that pokemon this one?
the one that evolves from rhyhorn?
remember that video of some russian guy beating up a store manager because they wouldnt let him park his bike inside
I'm starting a mission this year to collect EVERY tyranitar pokemon card
how much of that can be done in a single amazon cart
dang this new generation of card shop owners be SLACKING
I would be too if I evolved into a card shop owner
I'm probably going to be doing most of my buying from either TCG player or local shops
that gym was great it was full of women
Amazon only has like 15 tyranitar cards
I'd like to start at the oldest and work my way to the newest which starts me in Neo destiny era
second page has a few more it might be more like 20-25 from amazon.
But how reliable is my only question
I've been scammed on Amazon before sadly
I had a phase where I was buying MTG cards from Amazon and didn't get scammed once.
Hm. May have to look into it
I bought all the joke cards and showed my friends
The one that you rip up and throw on the play mat to deal damage.
Waterfall became so based and so useful with the phys special split
I mean you can't say you didn't call it
you gonna go catch the ho oh or what
It was trying times back then
would you prefer a flavorful, custom sound effect for waterfall..... or Ktanto
Ho oh is gonna be something dumb
ho oh will be a sunflora
we know that for sure from the cries?
I just got fuckin coconut malled
i think we will be elitefourable
I think moltres can already beat lance's ass
that charmander has CUrious BONE syndrome
i dont want to explain lickitung
have you checked the berserk gene
hey kid take this soft sand....
Ur clamming up my style in this wind
Keep it interesting I'm tuning in from the shower LUL
Are we about to witness a clean sweep
have you glitched into the safari zone
I watched this LIVE ON TWITCH
I've been voting on this one and apparently the first time you played was one of the only streams I missed
Have the VOD queued to watch at some point but haven't gotten to it yet
gonna be heading out in a bit, so I'll be lruking
We're gonna be here a while phanto274BLANKIES
I clicked first, did I get scammed?
had to interrupt myself with a brief shovelling
suprise ur speed running the remake isnt it better
but u still speedrun the exact same way right
or u just like the randomizser
there really is no competition nor comparison with this and the remake unlike oot and mm on 3d. Its just taste
Bot how much anger do you have to eat fuzzies?
I love the star dance DinoDance MegaManDance DinoDance MegaManDance
Couldn't find one easily, maybe I could make one
Mario RPG with the worse graphics
GL on the rest of the run!
lol it puts mallow over mario so you've got two mallows, i didn't notice that until now
it really do be super mallow rpg
watch the work pants are at tadpole lake and the tenor card just saved the run
at an open bar, got any mixed drink recommendations?
I've asked for a long Island and a sour whiskey thua far and they haven't said no yet
Beautiful a glass cannon to someone who already was made of glass
I'm actually almost halfway done with it I only need to find the last star
It's not going to figure out how to get the train and saying it's needs repaired
You know I think about it yes
Why is there somebody over there in the volcano
I already got the red star piece
No I totally forgot about that
I got my Mario level 23
I think the remake is way better
The original with Bowser's face looks ugly
Am found his parents right now
Found them and you was right
It looks like you hate that room
That's what Gino looks like in the original
All right I  in Bowser's key
All of them scared of me cuz I'm too strong for them
Yeah I did not see that coming
I have to say that game for tomorrow
I have to play it tomorrow
OMG what a breaking news this is. It seems as though there are beings stronger than zeno and DB will get a 10 yr arc!
just got back from cleaning my ps5
time to look over enviro4Notes jcogNote minimi6Notes tippiNotes
this is my fave fire dragon boss for a reason
jinx fight looks like hot garbage ass
HOLD up 30% to insta kill
your frustration is how i feel about this game all too often
@DrBarber88 Rando makes u tippiThink jcogThink
Is this rando new or something?
Oh okay. Yeah sounds like your screwed
probably that one secret boss that you don't see very often ;)
does frogfucius maybe trigger the star hill star? I imagine you've probably done that already though
does this mean that the feather can't be anything?
oh garrow just lets you go back
i believe he have whatever vanilla boss is here hp
i kinda knew from the jump it was a dead seed. Spoiler Log time?

I need it to be the 12th
Yeah I gotta get to the airport at 9am
Finally, a Mario RPG without Jinx
1 level makes all the difference phanto274Smile
Theoretically you also get more partner and stat upgrades
I got a dokkan youtuber interested in pape randos today
The 1st time I beat bowser I just winged it
I didnt know how to set up danger mario
I fought Bowser without danger Mario (when I first played casually) and the fight took 30 minutes even with good items
People have become too reliant taking half damage lol
I've never been more proud of you
If I fought Bowser again with knowledge of actual strategies that people use, I probably would save a good amount of time
maybe you thought goombario was at the beach and you reallllly want to get him
I'd go to the beach for goombario
We did never specify which summer
Oh, you didn't check Merlow while you were over there? Huh
Could be risky, could be worth it
gl hf o/ Did'cha ever run into the jr music bug again?
perry the platypus, i have no time for these simple games, i haven't even finished my inator, what are you doing here?
let’s see what paper 📝 jinx has in store 🏬 for us
good news: my new shower chair works
i'm not horribly dead after taking one
I'm wondering how you could fix danger mario without beating it with the nerf bat.
I'm shy till i get comfy, then i don't stfu
yeah im usually shy that way too, or if im 1/2 into a drink OMEGALUL
Ya or maybe remove last stand specifically. Then you have that risk using power/mega rush
I can see our 32oz margs are gonna be fire
I'M WILLING TO DIE FOR IT
I’m a social butterfly 🦋 but I do hate bumping into ppl I know in public
So, that 1oz could potentially kick my ass
Cats we stayed up every night at SGDQ till like 6am, and we ordered Taco Bell like 5 times
I dont drink at all so I don't pay attention to alchohol
staying up shouldnt be terrible as long as i have caffeine NiceSoftlock
GDQ has a sponsorship with Red Bull
Yeah, Phantom and I are volunteers, so we have infinite red bull
I never 👎 red bulled or monstered
I can't believe cats is going to be wired on her first ever appearance at GDQ KEKW
idk anyone else whos volunteering besides my one friend, hes host for some runs some nights and i think he does a lot of other stuff too with tech PAUSERS
Gonna be all of us iceblue69LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Phantom and I are gonna play an LADX rando that's got stupid settings
i might volunteer next time. I just wanted my first one to be chill so Gladge
blame iceblue NOTED wait what  HUH
ice 🧊 blue heart 🩵 trying to rig the event on u all
Only pape rando runners get excited for dirt
Note to self, suggest randomized boss patterns.
I still say randomize windmill key
it could be like 4th ruins key
Ralph selling the good stuff today
Its been 0 days since phantom talked to a tree
i may have overgrinded a bit in FF7 lmao
but i do have aerith's level 4 limit break
Power bounce is probably in ruins lol
So.. you gonna deliver that mail???
But but, in rain sleet or shine
Thinking out it, maybe instead of bringing danger mario down, other badges could be brought up. Like I've always thought it would be cool for spin smash to knock over the Koopa bros tower.
But you see that the issue, the tried and true methods always prevails
i mean d down pound is not  bad on him

"It feels to easy" coming from someone like you feels like it wouldn't be terrible wrong for league tbf
even with 3 hearts its easy
Might be something about RPG randos? Generally harder than adventure / jump n run randos, maybe?
Ya its more about the journey than the fights
Or you have RPG randos that give you OP items early on and then they turn into "find the items" rando, ignoring battles
Maybe it's about the good items having requirements? Paper has BP and FP thresholds, Dark Souls has stat requirements for weapons ... whereas some RPG randos are just like "you found it, just equip it"
Oh the minesweeper tracker is back, yay
What do you mean I see nothing wrong, its completely normal
It's 40% per room to be flipped, and 1 in 3 seeds has one entire area chosen at random the gets completely flipped
2 bp power plus, thats gotta be illegal
The train, so it could start one direction and end in the other
ok this is 10x better then mirror mode
just find the 6 bp peekaboo Kappa
Static mirroring's gotta be even worse with seed bleed. You just memorized that this one map is always mirrored, and now maybe it's not anymore
Welp we're lost, better ask the locals for directions
Is there a visual que for desert maps mirroring, I wonder?
Okay, the sun rays don't help, they're always on the right
maybe entering a north/south entrance from the right or left edge of the LZ, to see which way Mario enters the next map from?
the 2 empty spots on your tracker are making me suffer
you should just steal his coin
I just subbed for 3 years it's the least you can do
oh did someone fucking turn off health LOL
Kooper is getting his exercise today
... huh? What BP setting is this
So is it full random bp?
Shuffled was going to be my guess, yeah
Was about to say, it cannot be fully random since that is supposed to cap at 6 BP
I think with beta badges and shuffled, exactly 1 badge can be 9 BP
(which is kind of silly and I'll probably change that)
Well... I think we would get in trouble for answering that
im going back to sleep in a sec
it was -22 when i went to sleep now its -9
am i crazy or is this map mirrored
noo im telling you the moles are on the right side
i cleaned my entire setup and rearranged it yesterday its so clean
the map is mirrored you're lying
are the bp random or fixed
im jus gonna listen now and sleep gö
that cold water at 3am hits differentt
I created something blursed and I could finally share it online
it was a belated xmas gift for friend
they finally got and opened the package
I sent it out after xmas
and they have a PO box
so while it did arrive yesterday, they went in today to get it
and then the were a big meanie and teased me not opening it right away and made lunch and did chores first ch0mskYtilt ch0mskYtilt
Are you 2 hours deep with no hammer? Lmao
Is it me or is twitch tv tv only good for 2 weeks?
you do have 2 hammers u can get
I FINISHED MY FIRST PRIME RANDO!!
I used spoiler log on phazon mines so it didnt drag on too much longer but it did get finished
are yellow squares on map tracker for out of logic checks like if you skip mystery note?
some rooms being reversed is unbelievably cursed
what if the whole time u had the last seed on you
