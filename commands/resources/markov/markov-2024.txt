omg i love kirby64 so much
i'm here for the kirby yeeting
*looks at the mess behind her* i mean i guess cleaning up is fine
i see it as more lived in than messy lmao
dragon fruit has been my addiction ever since I got it
I only remember from Brawl Dedede
Just left me scarred enough to fucking hate Kirby games
This game probably has the best selection of copy abilities
Even tho star allies is my favorite, I still love every single kirby game
He's gonna become an artist streamer
I think Adventure introduced that or Super Star I don't remember well
Cutter in DR3 and 64 is kinda bad by itself
how is it 100% if you dont get all the info cards Kappa
Just die, it turns into 01, and you win
is this your first kiirby speedrun?
the combine system is cool af
Can't wait for the dynamite level
I've always thought about running this but never have
One day Seasons will happen jaycFeels
I think the coolest ability is Cutter plus spark
i like bomb and cutter a lot - the ninja star haha
was it bomb and cutter or spark and cutter?
My personal favorite is Cutter+Bomb, with Ice+Spark being a close second
Very unfair and way too long
how did you enjoy rock + cutter? (the shape changer shard mission thing)
I feel you should've got a HP refill when Dedede took control
howd you get to dry dry ruins?
already at the start of the new yr ur now my fave streamer
world 2 in every game ever
Stone+Cutter is cool cause you only use pitch
oh this one is fun too
Ice+Fire is the best combine copy ability stickshamChaos
Isnt there that 1 level in fire planet(forgot the name)where you need double ice for a crystal star
Yeah, 2x of me sounds really fuckin toxic
ice cut is good too, ice skating I think?
Needle I feel in 64 has a ton of utility with all combinations
Doesn't save you from the 2 second timeouts
Is this run going on the youtubes?
it’s a weird room yes. one thing that helps with the jumps is if you’re running to the left before jumping, it allows for faster horizontal movement
oh def. this room ain’t easy. it was a TAS only trick for a while PrideLaugh
I forget lightbulb is an ability
Forgotten Land isn't a real game
Someone needs to make that an animated emote
I think Fire+Spark is funny but it's bad
fire+spark is my fav combo just for the animation PrideLaugh
Pix is such a strange boss
fuck, now you’re making me want to run this again lol
"Do you think Geoff has ever heard of Ghost Trick?" First reply is "he thinks its an indie game. KEKW
lol they had to get the last hit
How do you perfect frame that lol
like a frame or two later
Phantom, you should learn BM64 with me
new game, still shitty spear guy enemies
Perfect opportunity to do it then lol
the way I started remembering easy was with Curtis. when you get to the small waterfalls, count “1, 2, 3” in the lollipop owl voice and you’ll know exactly where it is PrideLaugh
28 means you purposely manipped rng to make it go further PrideLaugh
Strange parasol isn't in this game
so i take it this is fishing?
Yes Stavros this is adult fishing
Never knew this as a kid
i never knew about the fish :O
i never knew til I learned this run LOL
i only lifted them up like that for meat shield lol
Don't most enemies have a special property like that?
I would assume the spear guy is one of them?
if you want bomb for Acro, 2-4 in the beginning, the rocket enemy
also, did you know Acro spelled backwards is Oil Spill?
i mean technically by this game, this is your second fight LOL
I don’t remember this part of Sea World
yeahh, now the run is about to get fucking hard
Wdym, isn't that an everyday occurrence?
Why did it just let you drop like that?
I remember using the Bird and using to glide across
I just learned that Mother3 has a book of mario translation
but yeah, it’s still ridiculous how they have you do this
Don't you know, when you actually are speedrunning, nothing goes your way?
because you have to carry ice through the entire stage as well
hold up, YOU DOING CURLING STONE STRATS: 👀
it’s parasol, top hat, or pizza
parasol worst luck, pizza(?) for best luck
Is hat the best one to get?
i just know parasol is worst LOL
oh boy I hope it crashes!
yo did i hear vc crashes Pog
you can eat those rocks too
I guess we take that L
yeah, sparky’s a lil bitch in this level
yeah, that’s what I meant PrideLaugh
yeahh, you can moonwalk if you’d like
or climb up the stairs without your sprite moving LMAO
Fond memories of renting this game from Blockbuster
what's this I heard from the other side of my room about swallowing
good luck against the most terrifying bosses ever... a D20
It's so funny how ass burn kirby is in this game compared to every other LOL
nice you got fire at last
it’s pretty rare in general without manip
Why blud got a bandaid on his head who put that there
so fun thing about this fight, I believe you can use the L and R buttons as well
popesPOGGERS_HF minimi6Pog ghunzoEPOGna tippiPog popesPOGGERS_SG phanto274GG jcogGERSC qwilliPauggie jcogGERS
it’s one of those things you just have to try out, not during a run though
yeah, this game has a high technical skill level
this is kinda peaking my interest
it’s why I had to stop
hol up, kirby has a copy ability??
@JamminJami any of the swords or rock statues
some based kirby crystal shard gaming
as for my fave being a bomb and op fire fire(living comet)
Part of me wishes i actually learned this game
I was thinking about it like until manip came out and then stopped haha
Thats fair, for when you need a break from Rando?
Well... this ain't mario 🤔 phanto274GL
So I can redeem another pape rando?
damb did I miss the run
Okay I can't make them myself too many settings 🤣 but if I leave in notes is that fine again?
game overs are bad and unfair and never ever happen in this game
you say that as if majority of all artists don't do porn
Max rando no access to prologue or chapter 7. Cheap or low cost bp/fp badges etc and hopefully glitchless 😁
No rush I have a roof here to get fixed and clean up after that 🥴
I should see about porting Rock Star to MMR again
I had instruments and stuff figured out, just a matter of editing
It actually sounds super good in the MM soundfont
Kirby is the most talented nonbiney of all time
i remember this game being so hard
yeah it’s easy to do alongside the moonwalking
Everyone always says this game is so hard and I go ????
the final boss is no joke and some of the combo powerups are hard to figure out in places
but it may be one of those like
'I grew up with the game how can it be hard' deals
this game is medium strength at best it tests ur knowledge/skill/ platforming
from a speedrunning perspective I can absolutely see how this game is rough
eh, i can see how it would be hard for some.  I wouldnt say its hard as much as it can punish you for real for making mistakes
I enjoy him in theory but playing him is like running in Fatal Frame
Now I wanna play Kirby 64
*this* was the bastard piece for me growing up
I need a Kirby Jam emote tbh
all Kirby songs are pretty much bangers
The stage 2 forest theme sounded more like a Christmas tune
Me when I'm below u and my beak is pointy B>
happy new year! im doing good, i hope you are doing well
Hey I beat this recently jcogLurk
THAT'S how you get that shard??
to know that, you would literally have to play Kirby’s Dream Land 3
i transformed myself into a rock! I'm rocky rick!!
Maybe it's cause I played Ecco and Majora's Mask but it's more like widevibe than anything else
I’m glad they weren’t that evil at least LUL
IDT it's on this channel but it's a bunny moving with its arms back and forth
This level was eating my ass before
one of things off that pull starting off is not to jump off but go all the way down on the pole and then press right to let go
Second hardest in the game imo
I thought the fight would be over after that first phase
look, sometimes you just gotta fish with dynamite
well maybe the endangered species shouldn't have played fuck around and find out
They even attack bougie ships come on now
It was fun doing this without an ability afterward lol
people who cannot hold their breath or are mute cannot
or wait maybe it’s go all the way down the pole and then press down at the bottom. i can’t remember
The spiders are the worst sometimes
It doesn’t help that it takes so long to get too
yeah this is a real dangerous power up
esp given you can't really duck to bring out ur hard helmet
Rock bomb is the dynamite right?
I wanna put Kirby in my mouth and I hope he tastes like bubble gum
they gotta make the game last longer so....artificial padding
Considering this game can be finished without glitches in like 4-5 hours, yea
They clearly did it to force players to replay previous levels
Don’t talk about their balls like that
Yo, Phantom. Happy New Year, chat! nagPeepohappy
Just 30 more days of Kirby zfgSad
Bold of you to think I even pay attention
Can we get to part where I just teach you Luigi’s Mansion 100% instead? zfgSmug
I regret selling Luigi's Mansion 😔 But I had beat it so many times....
That reminds me weren't the waddles enemies?
All my homies hate Kirby zfgMad
I didn’t realize you could protect yourself from that
That ability is high key ass tho
watch out for the weaponized bird turds
I know there’s one in world 3?
when did you start Playing Super Metroid
Fire cutter probably the most fun ability imo
Is this game just annoying to run?
It'd be so fuckin hella if it was like 1.5x faster
Honestly that ability is down there just above dynamite for me LUL
Like, you’d think it would at least be fast
Hated this level just for the crystal shard at the end
This one in particular was really bad for me
man i just love the coolness of this lvl
really interested to see how a speedrun of this goes
this game is good and fair
It's basically those castles from Super Mario World
Died at least 5 or 6 times just to crushers
This game do have the banger music
@buff00n the run is fine to me
now you got me wanting to try a 100% speedrun of this too
learning which moves you need to get the gems
yeah, this run takes a ton of practice
interesting, yeah your right i wouldent of guessed that LUL
it’s one of, if not the most, technical Kirby games
Jacob's playing ash so he's the hero
i never would of guessed, i wanna do it just becaues i love this game LUL
oh god i DESPISE THIS BOSS
So fun fact. This boss is the reason I purchased this game on the Wii U eshop.
Endgame is upon us and Levias is epic!
Since I never beat it as a kid LUL
just got straight up DVD Screen'd
this boss always gives me such a hard time
It took me forever to beat this as a lad lol
I lost track of the sub goal someone help me remember
Sub goal met party time all!
what does the purple block thing do?
Hey its void- I mean 02
I was obsessed with the mini games tho
and star rail just railed me again Sadge
Yes bc all biblically accurate angels have giant green spikey dicks
wait we did not hit the sub goal?
honestly no one cares for any% LOL
Whispy will still be the same. outside of that I’m not sure
Yo somebody gifted me a sub earlier, THANK YOU
I was going to prime when I got mine lol but grateful for the sub @str9ngest9r monadoHug
Double fire all the way across the sky
yknow double fire being the speedrun move of choice makes sense LUL
iirc it’s faster a bit to single fire this run, but you also don’t wnt dead hands PrideLaugh
Yo thanks for the gift sub @LordLevias19 ! phanto274Jam
Kirby squeak squad was a really good game
I love getting Wegmans muffins. Blueberry and their Doble chocolate are my go tos
Kirby air ride was great as well
some muffins has chocolate that tastes like ink
It's a grocery chain in select areas of the ne.
have you tried honkai star rail yet?
double fire so op beyond belief jaye
Also Im very annoyed bc Ive been trying to do my fafsa for the past week and the site has been in maintenance this whole week
I'm a ny local and it's my fave store, but I don't drive and can only go if a friend takes me. So I usually end up walking to dollar general
Oh, thanks for the sub mossro1Popop phanto274BLANKIES
Not me dying to the first pillar on this level monadoPAUSE
Are there any differences aside from the crystal shards?
Is there a run that requires all the cards?
oh that would be diabolical KEKW
people have done true 100% before. collecting all the cards doesn’t take too long
but it’s more rare I believe
What do the cards even do?
when I did it, I got mostly new ones
and you’ll know if it’s new or not because Kirby reacts differently
what the name of this boss fight again
the dp off the reflector was OD
honestly do not blame you lol
kirby kills everyone whos stands in his way rionavKnife
and he gets praised for it
Wordle 926 4/6*  ⬛🟨🟨⬛⬛ ⬛🟨⬛⬛🟨 🟩⬛🟩🟩⬛ 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
here comes kirby reigning fiery vengeance
you're getting gold splits, that's all that matters Kappa
"Player 2 FINALLY takes a round!" rub it in, asshole
i'm pretty sure this is the type of game where you can get a good time w/ mostly game knowledge alone
Kirby, master of the good ol suck-n-swallow
i love this cute little guy
Kirby how would you like it if someone broke into your house n throws bombs on you
he's just trying to cook you up
I tried out the demo of this, terry is really fun to play. I was getting excited doing quarter circles with my fight stick lol
submit them and then come back after you've got a wr and compare xD
I was like, I get now, I know why people use fight sticks
it's like learning taxes for the first time
i liked the grind for manips in Pokemon but i don't know that i'd want to do that for multiple games :)
just need to get that ace any% skip down
at least it's not arbitrary ;)
Couldn't learn how to consistently grab but when it happened I'd pop off lol
I learned a couple of alttp glitches for an any% and then decided i didn't like the speedrun
i like the music in this game - wonder why i've never ran it before
the boss that can crash on runs
I love the random witch just chillin in hte bg
I don't know what that game is
You're not doing enough Brian Copters
i hated this level as a kid lol
That crusher can eat my ass
It’s mainly getting crushed on the corners that’s triggering
It kinda sucks you can’t guard in this game
I couldn’t tell if you just walked into it or not
I'm not gonna be playing SMRPG for a while. Gotta derust CV3
Yeah, I didn't read much lmao
We also now fight Dodo KEKW
I'll let them cook on that for a couple weeks
They got rid of jump shoes johnny at least
Oh so, I think we're just gonna roll with 5 people in the room
And maybe not do the upgrade
I think it's a standard double room
This is my favorite track in the game
Hotel cost is looking around 308ish if I calc'd tax right
why hotel bunk in with a local gamer
Kirby still cosplaying Pikachu from Smash Bros on the 64
'rude ass pix' me yelling about my art in the bg'
when does the rng manip start :)
had a funny moment at work early
customer was trying to opt out of text messages but all they sent was "stop fucking"
i'm ace i'm way ahead of you
i love that stone kine is literally useless
like he doesn't even get "swim slowly"
her leg really just went through najd's little poke
i need to remember really funny things can happen to athena when far d whiffs
its still not a great far c
i just didnt know it was cancelable lmao
I'm now inside so i can actually watch
we are clawing our way back
with how often yurikov does missed light confirm>oops i'll throw now i really should be mashing on hit more (it works against us every time so why wouldn't he lmao)
bind the touchpad to roll tho
keep 2 hands on the wheel at all times
Also I'm unsure if it's my end or not, my net looks fine but stream has been stuttery
we gotta get more sand characters in FGs. Kukri is dope
we gotta get more sand characters in Butts. Kukbutt is dope
we gotta get more sand in my butt
does his pillow have a name?
This is the level where I got pissed at the game
Keep in mind I was like 6 years old at the time
What if you made Brian Copter an emote?
small character easy link lets go
I thought you had some save in World 6
A death in 5-3, lost some power up in 6
but hes probably gonna do kyo k iori
he do be throwing it back
hmm maybe this ggy knows how to kof
the athena timeouts we're nasty tho
what am i even looking at lmao
Kooper and goombario got your back?  well this is over already lol
can you get back to toad town?
LUL what is happening?!? also hi also also gl
unfortunately many adults would do that LOL
so is this a full on mod or just like a small game?
is the toad who you trade candy stars with?
did 54 attempts at jr troopa segment and finally got a 3:22
yo tiger ty for the gl
Yo lopez ty for the gl
Maybe the crying animation is weirdly long on console or something
what in the fuck is the grass
I like that a lot LOL
all these misses make me think it’s the opposite of master quest Kappa
Twitch took my money yesterday, but I couldn't send this message until today
I mean, you also could cheat
I feel like I back seated when I shouldn't have LUL
ummm excuse me… this isn’t the sewers
What's so "sweet" about this expedition
but he has no ears 🤔
Man that was a touching finale.
Can you hit it from below?
the dev is calling it shit NODDERS
Now I will finish you you bitch swifSleep
One of these days this account will be banned I swear KEKW
That much stop time is also too much
What was your first run btw? Just curious
What did they find this time now
And it also depends on how much you save
Because if it's like 20s just, no
I'd say don't change it KEKW too much hassle
Yeah because resources change and you need a new management and command chain
Remind me to bother you about mcr shit if I get curious
this music makes me want to march tho
well i was talking about the jungle music :)
sounds like one of the mana franchise tho
I miss the cow already Sadge
i suppose they can have their opinion lol
Last time I had that kind of comment I bothered the fuck outta them doing it
I have rolling muscle memory embedded into my brain
And if you say stop glitching you know what happens next phanto274Smile
I don't always pay super close attention to Zelda randos but did I choose a reasonable pred?
It's around the same time frame my randos get bomb bag or bow so swifLove you good
I know both can happen where you go forever without a sword or get a bunch up-front
You do in fact have a bunch of non-sword key items already though so we'll see
getting it done the right way
you like it that much huh
hey! the rando I woted on today. Cant be mad if it loses the poll now LUL
how was pape? saw I missed the first hour and a half and didnt want to tune in then
partner with poison status sounds cool
well thats all I know LUL
but do you have dance unlocked?
I knew id forget so thats why I sent it
At least you won't run out of bombs any time soon now.
I'm just waiting for your one of your next few checks to be another sword upgrade.
That would be just my luck. Personally. XD
This seed really wants you to blow stuff up, apparently.
I want my bs hamtaro speedrun
Now I'm thirsty for a soda pop, brb.
The good news in a race, everyone would have to come back here eventually, not just you.
Does that mean we aren't out of logic anymore?
I don't know this game as well as some others. XD
It would have been really gross if that was where flippers was.
Personally, I never actually compete in races, but I do sometimes do race seeds on my own just for fun.
I couldn't handle the pressure in an actual race though.
Link is a healthy boy this seed.
twas good! i'm quite liking it
You should celebrate when you move in by leaving your dishes out and getting a dog
and it's got music up there with dark souls 3
It's weird cause I've never gotten into the actual SoulsBorn games but between Lies of P and Star Wars Jedi I have been interested in quite a few games of that style. It's weird.
i still need to get jedi survivor
i love each and every boss in the dark souls game. I only made a tier list for Elden Ring
I've even took a good look at Elden Ring a few times
Lies of P my fave is Metal Knight Jester Giant.
i enjoyed elden ring until the end game
yeah, everything post leyndell were painful
1. Dragon armed (forgot spelling) 2. Ghost Lion Man (forgot spelling again) 3. Enchanted Mega deer (cant spell)
That caterpillar sounded like a Pokemon trainer humping a wall
Honorable mention with the twin aspect is the golden duo both (fat and skinny)
I made it with ground beef and diced mushrooms
I mean seasoning is important so it doesn't taste like shit or bland
I think beef (or steak chunks) and shrooms works causes the meat ends up overpowering the mushrooms most of the time
mushrooms and onions over shadow meats.
Phantom if I purchased lethal company for you would you play it with me and proc
that's better then we'll die together
how fast will we swing today
but it could be your dollar
as long as i don't need to specify the use of the bomb
Avoiding Castor Wilds at all costs.
Something tells me the shop lady is holding this seed hostage.
I wonder what the thumbnail will be this time? So many things it could be. XD
Once it's worthy you'll get the other
do you have a final goal in mind for this game?
what are times like on snes?
yeah, was curious how close they are
we are set to rock this
at least jp bn runners dont include credits LUL
btw the answer to your question from the other day, only JP version of Pape does watt do extra damage in lava
well that's something to enter during lol
GL with run yo, im bout to start spm any% PB attempts
I beat the fnaf thing I was doing last night
I have been attempting the hardest challenge in the game and I havent even got past the 1st 20 seconds
50/20 mode in UCN, you need inhuman levels of reaction time and patients
One of the fuckers lingers in the office and my mouse goes over it for 0.8 seconds I lose
customer comes in, asks if a question is grammatically correct, i confirm it is and ask if they have any product-related questions. they then ask me a prompt to write their landing page about one thing but also mentioning another
so i explain what i'm actually there for, ask again if there's product-related questions i can assist with
and then they ask "are you a real person"
i respond that yes i am indeed a real person
and they say "oh my bad I thought you were an AI"
an N64 controller would be great to use for emulating Wonderswan, since that has effectively 2 D-pads and then 2 face buttons
you mean you never played the LEGENDARY EXE GAME?!?
you mean you don't wanna play BATTLE CHIP CHALLENGE but WORSE?!?
seriously tho BCC is based on N1 Battle, BCC fixed up a LOT of things
BCC isn't that bad honestly, could be better but it's neat. there is the Chip Control Mod now
which makes it even more fun
instead of it being RNG which route is taken you get to actually choose that route
but yeah looking at N1 battle...
Dang, Osu is such a  good game
you only get Lan's story, there's 108 chips total, only 20 navis, no Slot In, chips go based on speed instead of selection order, rows are reversed, and no panel changing
so if you set your folder a certain way those chips will always go in that way, which is kinda boring lmao
geno where the fuck were you standing to fall like that
Look at this boss, button mashing!
I hope you like dumb jokes because I'm full of them
no i want you to run the game with even OLDER strats, play the game like it's the SNES original Kappa
no not play the game on snes, play the remake as if it is the same speedrun as the snes one
why does that house have a turbine attached to it
i don't see power lines in the mushroom kingdom!
Yo Phantom, gl with the new route!
Tiny Master Chief could fit in this game's aesthetic
Have you tried not having a 5 turn fight?
Oh you do fake chomp over hurly?
I guess it just takes too much time to unlock real chomp and too much money to get hurly gloves
Just use that money on margs
(all compared to the time those weapons would save)
Twitch is weird and messing up my anniversaries but anyways hello phanto274Smile
Oh it didn't even play the alert phanto274Lurk
That sounds like a lame place to reset too
The cake is bad enough too
This song is gonna be burned in my brain
I mean, I'd join you for the BN2 rando
I wouldn't suggest it without joining phanto274Smile
I can't believe you'd hurt me like this
That's what the dollar sign is for
something like A$1 means "keep it in column A"
and B$3$ means "keep it on cell B3"
oh, I forgot the dollar sign needs to be before the column letter or row number
Baja blast is only available at Walmart near me, and I'll be damned if I go to Walmart jsrSad
bring the walmart onto your property
Delivery around here is like another 13 dollars
no moar Baja Blast at Taco Bell, or is it more like no Taco Bell nearby either
Nah it's 20th anniversary of it, so it's available to purchase all of 2024
You just gotta go to walmart apparently
Which I'd rather snap my ankle in 20 places before I set foot into a walmart
closest baja blast to me is a dollar general on the highway
it's one of the newer dollar generals too
Closest dollar general to me is in the bad part of town phanto274Smile
(For reference, I live in New Orleans)
yeah thst's a dont go there for sure
unless it's also an iffy walmart
You could always grab the 50 chest before shaman skip
If you're short coins for nimbus
Do me a favor, go to 2-1 for me
Mf the only Kirby game you play
Nintendo was putting health and safety warnings on all their games but it wasnt enough to keep a generation from becoming myopic losers with all sorts of health issues
Do you do any of the glitches?
No the heck way my fave game of all all alll time!
Want me to teach you super jumps?
I can show you at GDQ
I have a 1:03 in this game lmao
Goomba surfing ruined the run for me phanto274Smile
i know how to get to 8th dungeon without mirror shield and get the key to the 3rd dungeon without doing the side quest
The best opening of any video game
you sure this hard logic? Analyze
This game, seasons and ages are just so fucking good
God damn you're gonna be in go mode in like 10 minutes
ok so this looking like very easy logic to me
I feel embarrassed to say I didn't play this game until it got ported to switch
i played this all the time back on my gameboy sp
i don't think i had the og gameboy version
It was GB for LA, GBC for LADX, and Switch
gameboy color version had boomerang and the color dungeon
Not a glitch, but it's a trick
Oh maybe you can enter D2
i left and came back and we are kirby in zelda? lol nice
you can tell this is an old kirby game because he doesn't have a hat with sword
I like the pac man noise when you fall into a pit
You can't pit walk that far
so what dumb settings did you choose for this
Oh I looked away and you got powder. How'd you do it
I'll take your word for it Kappa
it take you to the start of the game
try it maybe i am wrong haven't played this in year
yes L and R. two buttons known for being on the GB
it's A B Start Select on the main screen
Can't you lift signs in this game with power bracelet?
Rip. Another change added in seasons/ages
I know in seasons, you got a ring for breaking so many signs LUL
flying rooster is just an item in this i love it
okay now get Cutter and ride Coo, you'll kill everything
Maybe click bow wow a few times?
but you can't use him in dungeons so
who let kirby have a sword
this went from goish to struggle in a matter of minutes
You can dash into him with sword
what if this guy have the feather
i can see this for hard logic but not normal logic tf
heck, maddy put our I Can't Feel My Face pepper flake blend in the spaghetti sauce
WAS THAT A CHEST FROM D4
the flower is for the hippo in animal village iirc
last time i play this game i didn't do the trade quest
I'm trying to think what else you have open
Try and do the yellow things that aren't in dungeons
isn't bee hive guy north here
You can use the bird to fly over the swimming spot
And gain access to the Eagle Key spot
What do you need a bomb for
Or mambo's brings you to Crazy Tracys
All you have to do is enter the screen
With the teleporters and it unlocks them
You can also go up the stairs
That leads to the cave with the Eagle Key
i had a seed where it expected me to owl everywhere so many places
There's an item in this cave
so i know exactly what you can do with it
you can get almost to turtle rock with the owl
also i'm so used to seeing coo already i'm calling the rooster the owl lmfao
How many seashells do you have
iirc there's a cave under those rocks
I'm trying to see what I can figure out
is it one of the rocks i was trying to point out lol
The cave you're talking mirby is a mad batter
yeah but that cuold be something
You have rooster so you can float to it
Are mad batters in logic too?
Cause the chest you opened on the west side
i think they got bow wow from a mad batter
Can you send me a screenshot of your map?
So I can see what you've checked
you can bomb the bottom wall in this room but it's just rupees as we saw
i know you don't have bombs right now
this is a spot i ALWAYS forget about (it's a piece of heart in vanilla)
also the flower goes to a hippo in a house in animal village
Oh and the yellow box at the bottom
You can fly the rooster too
It'll bring you straight to Richard's villa
I think he takes the hibiscus
u got to be shitting me
If you wanna do one of these at GDQ, I can show you stuff
idk what's up with the tracker
Do you need the 5 leaves in this?
So you set a respawn point
Better hope you get instrument room
alright we schmoving and gettin  on now
Well. You found the beak last. Wonder what the owl says LUL
The hitbox on the final boss slime
That's gonna have most checks, yeah
High chance you'll find a dungeon key there
It's 15 shells for the koholint sword, I think
Oh you found the secret zelda portion of Kirby 64, most people don't know about it
carolina reaper, moruga scorpion, ghost pepper, and habanero flake blend
You have to push the graves a specific way
5th grave down, 4th grave left, 1st grave up, 2nd grave right, 3rd grave up
It didn't space my numbers lmao
ice it's your favorite dungeon theme
hit them throw in right hole
that's to the quadruplets in mabe
Okay that goes to the baby in mabe
All you get is a bag of "stuff"
I wonder what's gonna be in the arcade this time at GDQ
What trade quest items do you have
also no lie if u chose red tunic after the boss I would unfollow. KEKW so they were randoed as well.
That opens up quite a few checks
The last item in Dick's Villa
Me and that Walrus are one and the same
Bomb the north wall in the fall room
Wish I could bomb a wall and find 50 bucks
i am very sick and looking for fun vibes. am i in the right place?
There's a bomb wall on the east wall
okay ill be holding you to that. if kirby dies im holding you personally responsible
i'd probably also drop my bong if you killed me though
Mine is a rare drop aspen
You gotta kill me multiple times
hope u've got some lives saved up then
I got somewhere between 6 and 9 of them
Using 5 of them at AGDQ
All that does is let you read the books in the library lol
The rando didn't change it to 1 leaf
Yeah remember that cave you went too on the far right?
Oh yeah you have red tunic
what the fuck you don't have PoP
It's all the same item LUL
You only gotta open 1 box
Sure wish I could duplicate 50 dollars
i want the key to the $50 room.........
back to the south part of the map
what the fuck is this rando
Yo he's walking on water kirby is god
Well now you have TONS to do
Kirby in the water kinda looks like a Kabuto
I need to go fishing where he's fishing
where are these quest npcs in real life?
I THINK THEY TOOK MORE THAN THE NECKLACE LADY
u are kirby can't u just float over it
i guess you'll just have to tape them to your body to kill enemies that run into ut hem
Did you get the very first chest
The hookshot one in room 2
You have no more chests lol
i dont think that revenge was what he had in mind
if that's his idea of revenge. im going to get a job at his favorite diner and spit in his soup
I wish someone would revenge that on me
all that for some dog food
u could also give it to ice it sounds like
what's ur quest reward for the dog food turn in?
no i mean the reward ice would give u
I would Ara Ara in your ear
There's a heart piece in the water
It's the guy up there that says he's tired and needs "vittles"
So he can throw it away instead of putting it on pizza
well you can full clear it with pb2
You're getting violated by this seed lmao
You gonna be able to make it to GDQ?
"I hear Phantom finally found the eagle key"
You should be able to stun them with Hook
So let me teach you a trick
Clip 1 pixel into the wall by walking as close as possible to the wall but enough so link can still walk
Then Feather and face into the wall at the same time then at the apex of the jump, press the opposite direction
Wow look at all those dollars you have
I have sleepy time medicine and chocolate
Jump and push into the wall then immediately press the other direction
At the apex press the other direction
So at the very top of the jump press left
I think when you initially jump you should be pushing into the wall
Then at the top of it change directions
Why is lmao censored on mobile???
Does twitch think I'm like.  9?
I just got the mulldozer clip on youtube LUL
First kirby64 now I see you running Kirby's Other Dream Land... You know, cause Link's Awakening is a dream... tough crowd phanto274Shrug
Ill be disappointed if you didnt name your file Kirby
Then at the top of the jump
Slash and press the other direction
The slash and other direction are the same frame
You just did it, but the statue pushed you lmao
Try maybe a bit before you reach the highest apex
You can jump over obstacles in dungeons with it
Okay so it's fast inputs when you do it
It basically tricks the game into thinking link is on a ledge
You can't clip into that though
Clip into the wall, jump and push into the wall itself, then once link gets close to the top, slash and press the opposite direction at the same time
I keep thinking it's super late for you, but it's like 10pm lol
Oh btw, if you wanna save quit to warp back to the front of dungeons
Should also have a home warp
If you press down twice I think
yo ice, did you heard BN LC is finally getting added to the leader board KEKW
what happens if you run out of bombs in this room?
2024 is truly a great year
I think the save quit menu also has a hidden option
phantom, I saw the funniest suggestion in the discord. Make volume 1 one game and volume 2 another game OMEGALUL
And the room north of the staircase exit
Oh they actually added the home option
When I last played it was an invisible menu LOL
It turns the anti fairys into fairies
You have d1 and d4 now
So in the speedrun we use the super jump
I'm lying to you in cold blood
when is Kirby in TMC rando?
are instruments added to the pool?
oh dang, I just noticed the timer
does switch verrsion have a rando too?
that would prob be my only reason to get a mig switch
the shark boss from kirby 64
I expected kirby to fly in on his warp star there KEKW
There's 9 fucking keys here wtf
you can super jump that block
Slash and face the other direction at the same time
these salsa verde doritos are fire
Since when is a Zelda rando generous
I've also heard this was one of the fun but as you're experiencing, potential to be hell
I've said it before, one thing is knowing the game and another knowing the logic
Oh I know, I loved tmc boots
Letter is the house right after woods
She just admitted to robbing a bank
My favorite pile of shit dungeon
Pls use magic rod it's op
You have the KNOB of destiny
I'm so stoked, I thought I needed to buy more pairs of pants for AGDQ cause I could only find 2 pairs
I went digging in the closet and found 3 more pairs that fit me
Ayyy you know the speed strats lmao
have a good night guys, 2am is my limit lol
will you be playing this hard logic again?
you need a jailbreak switch right
link looking kinda different in this game asachiTweethinks
i got subchips for half off
if you have BN2 in the GBA slot (or the game tricked into thinking you do via codes) you unlock a special subchip shop which sells FullEnrg, Unlocker, and LocEnemy chips for half off
game even says it's because subchips started in BN2
You can technically damage boost through the fire
If you clip into the left wall
Kinda like how you do a super jump
Just clip in, and dash up
Hard logic probably allows for the damage boost
Yeah but you gotta clip at the bottom of it
You don't need to dash this screen
just get a potion and die up there
i always do 8 before 7
hope so i should be in Bedge rn
Cover the whole floor for a chest there
@Iceblue i was thinking that but wasn't sure been years since i played this
how nice of that hinox to throw you at the exit
trendy game was in the entrance to eagle tower
how many points to make you do full er and key sanity?
i am close to half a mil points
You have to go read it
thought it was static til you looked
In rando? I don't think it is
dear lord all those long-ass times we got on jay's command just came true here, ice
btw i had a funny moment of exiting a battle before the voice clip finished so i had the effect of colonel going YOU ARE SKI
its 3 am i hope its not another run
good job phantom YOU ARE SKI
phantom question for you. who the fuck would use a LongSwrd E
fuck no, thursdays are my day off
it's not friday till i go to bed
i misspoke, it was a LongBlde E
Which is Quest 64, but on GB
yeah i learned about that looking at the retroachievements games, ice
i was like WAIT THERE'S QUEST 64 GB??!?
Do we have a redo of last night here?
i gotta try one of these one day
ive only every played ladx like once though lol
Yo there's easier settings for Phantom?
Is there still a pit jump?
So we doing an entrance rando at GDQ?
No bring back Pokémon BR, put it on the switch
It's not like I'm sleeping anyway
i see that ice is also a gacha enjoyer
Nah just your average runescape enjoyer blacktiger
What a time to come home with dinner
@Iceblue i see envi does have nice emotes tho
Did the rando have a quality downgrade or What ? (Kidding, I only played the Switch Version)
I've been subbed to envi since he had like 20k followers lmao
doesn't he have like 300k now
"Subscribed to Enviosity for 87 months with a current streak of 87 month."
I love paying the ultimate price
87 months damn i found out about him in 2020 cuz you know genshin
I also play genshin now lmao
is this the only zelda game where you can steal lol
Majora's Mask you could also steal
@Iceblue can i add you on genshin? i can help you out if u need it
You steal rupees and a hotel room from a goron lol
his fault for having the same name as you though
I'll post my UID in phantom's discord in the gaming channel
Identity theft is a bigger crime than robbery
i really should get back to adding people lol
I primarily play runescape, but i do log into genshin sometimes too
ok @Iceblue i added you if u ever need help hit me up
No way in a dungeon in UNDER 5 MINUTES
Oh sweet, Song of Soaring Kappa
Is this palutena or an I trippin
If I'm dumb just say so
Who let the bot write for the randomizer? KEKW
I think LASW would've been a better remake if they did more outside of a few QoLs and funny dungeon maker
see phantom just found you that's how nuts you are
hit the switch while you're on top of the blue buttons
NOTED logic for this game is kinda dumb
i can't believe ice just murdered phantom
Shovel only work season and ages
Tiny Doritos are cute and tasty. Just a little PSA
Oooo this is a different tracker from last night
Based on last night's run, seems like that map was a pile of asses
Ugh, this was something LASW did right, put Power Bracelet and Boots on their own button
Damn I haven't played audiosurf in years
song is too short to medal
I used to love getting baked and playing audiosurf
i once did a full 40 minute long song in audiosurf too
You are too op early on with the rod
Where you literally lag the game so bad, bosses don't spawn
I'd like to get a body door installed in my house
i mean he's just borgar so eat him
I'm assuming OG rod is like Hard ore for seasons? @iceblue LUL
No it does the same thing here
The game wasn't built to handle the sprite limit
So the game just mega lags with the fire rod shots on screen
And the lag is so bad the bosses just don't spawn
And you walk to the instrument rooms LUL
Make a puka shell necklace phanto274Thonk
At this rate make some ear rings as well
im back with pizza how is X doing?
i didn't know about the color dungeon till the remake came out
btw, if you're ever low on hearts
that has to feel good after last night
yes it's been stuck in my mind for 30 years
i love how the gator eats the dog food can and all
enjoyed the vod and i saw u chose red
Let the routing and thinking begin
Apparently the tracker is on top of the raid alert
talking about why big streamers ignore small streamers
Link’s Awakening with lots of Mario references
The color dungeon was the DX secret dungeon ? I think
Lots of keys and lots of maps
its not like you need a red tunic with a magic rod
Hmm idk where the switch is
you just got that necklace frm the last dungeon right?
why is a fish in an egg on a mountain?
@venturific i think in my mind its not an egg but a skull.
with the dots being blood stains. and the true maze of evil.
@stavros12c34anenoglou but then why is it in a skull? whoevers dream this is they are fed up!!
Well seeing as how this is my N1 FortOne popesOne_TK Zelda game in history i have my own head canon.

i am liking watching this rando
oh yeah agdq is soon LETSGO
i voted for pokemon early this week
honestly i think you should play what you want, i was the one who just voted and i could watch any of them
my dad was watching you play the zelda rando
he doesn’t use youtube for that stuff lol
i cant believe it im a mon!
fun fact I nicknamed my vehicle Black Pearl.
so this is kinda fitting me being a pirate fan as well
Y'all ever just sit around and eat way more pineapple than you should
literally me last night liquid lol
@str9ngest9r I'm being absurd right now. I've eaten almost a whole pineapple. But even better, from the comfort of my bed LUL
You cant just say Lugia doesn't have any rizz like that
Also I was looking back through the food posts in discord because I'm weird. But I appreciate you bc you use hexclad cookware
I would get some but MAN are they pricey
I just use a generic non stick pan, but it works surprisingly well for 40$
People fuck up by using metal utensils when cooking stuff
Forks, knives etc in the pan
swift start is a worrisome endish
I think I say this every time I watch a crystal playthrough, but this OST is probably one of my favorites
Yeah he's got balls for ya
Slugma used to look so bad hahahahaha
Not the Eevee I wouldve chose but its fine
Well this isn't the mario rando I redeemed Sadge but phanto274GL
Which is Monday for me and I have a plasterer coming to rip out a room and redo Madge
If only they were chicken nuggets
It got flooded bad on new years 🥴 after being hit by tornado like storms christmas day
Damn now we have to watch out for flying clams??
liquid is now a water dragon!
FUCK yes. I'm a shining sea serpent
oh shit am I the Vioplume? I didnt even notice
Can key items end up in GAMBA ?
Probably for the best it's not default LUL
yt to a comment I posted - "YOU KNOW I HATE GENO AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY BECAUSE GENO IS A REAL BADASS:
wow, rando loves loading up enemies w/ electric moves whenever you run a flying type
something about Pallos being a Lass is just... correct
This moltres really wanted to fuse with his triplets.
I think I have the first one wrong tho
Have we seen any of that pokemon this one?
the one that evolves from rhyhorn?
remember that video of some russian guy beating up a store manager because they wouldnt let him park his bike inside
I'm starting a mission this year to collect EVERY tyranitar pokemon card
how much of that can be done in a single amazon cart
dang this new generation of card shop owners be SLACKING
I would be too if I evolved into a card shop owner
I'm probably going to be doing most of my buying from either TCG player or local shops
that gym was great it was full of women
Amazon only has like 15 tyranitar cards
I'd like to start at the oldest and work my way to the newest which starts me in Neo destiny era
second page has a few more it might be more like 20-25 from amazon.
But how reliable is my only question
I've been scammed on Amazon before sadly
I had a phase where I was buying MTG cards from Amazon and didn't get scammed once.
Hm. May have to look into it
I bought all the joke cards and showed my friends
The one that you rip up and throw on the play mat to deal damage.
Waterfall became so based and so useful with the phys special split
I mean you can't say you didn't call it
you gonna go catch the ho oh or what
It was trying times back then
would you prefer a flavorful, custom sound effect for waterfall..... or Ktanto
Ho oh is gonna be something dumb
ho oh will be a sunflora
we know that for sure from the cries?
I just got fuckin coconut malled
i think we will be elitefourable
I think moltres can already beat lance's ass
that charmander has CUrious BONE syndrome
i dont want to explain lickitung
have you checked the berserk gene
hey kid take this soft sand....
Ur clamming up my style in this wind
Keep it interesting I'm tuning in from the shower LUL
Are we about to witness a clean sweep
have you glitched into the safari zone
I watched this LIVE ON TWITCH
I've been voting on this one and apparently the first time you played was one of the only streams I missed
Have the VOD queued to watch at some point but haven't gotten to it yet
gonna be heading out in a bit, so I'll be lruking
We're gonna be here a while phanto274BLANKIES
I clicked first, did I get scammed?
had to interrupt myself with a brief shovelling
suprise ur speed running the remake isnt it better
but u still speedrun the exact same way right
or u just like the randomizser
there really is no competition nor comparison with this and the remake unlike oot and mm on 3d. Its just taste
Bot how much anger do you have to eat fuzzies?
I love the star dance DinoDance MegaManDance DinoDance MegaManDance
Couldn't find one easily, maybe I could make one
Mario RPG with the worse graphics
GL on the rest of the run!
lol it puts mallow over mario so you've got two mallows, i didn't notice that until now
it really do be super mallow rpg
watch the work pants are at tadpole lake and the tenor card just saved the run
at an open bar, got any mixed drink recommendations?
I've asked for a long Island and a sour whiskey thua far and they haven't said no yet
Beautiful a glass cannon to someone who already was made of glass
I'm actually almost halfway done with it I only need to find the last star
It's not going to figure out how to get the train and saying it's needs repaired
You know I think about it yes
Why is there somebody over there in the volcano
I already got the red star piece
No I totally forgot about that
I got my Mario level 23
I think the remake is way better
The original with Bowser's face looks ugly
Am found his parents right now
Found them and you was right
It looks like you hate that room
That's what Gino looks like in the original
All right I  in Bowser's key
All of them scared of me cuz I'm too strong for them
Yeah I did not see that coming
I have to say that game for tomorrow
I have to play it tomorrow
OMG what a breaking news this is. It seems as though there are beings stronger than zeno and DB will get a 10 yr arc!
just got back from cleaning my ps5
time to look over enviro4Notes jcogNote minimi6Notes tippiNotes
this is my fave fire dragon boss for a reason
jinx fight looks like hot garbage ass
HOLD up 30% to insta kill
your frustration is how i feel about this game all too often
@DrBarber88 Rando makes u tippiThink jcogThink
Is this rando new or something?
Oh okay. Yeah sounds like your screwed
probably that one secret boss that you don't see very often ;)
does frogfucius maybe trigger the star hill star? I imagine you've probably done that already though
does this mean that the feather can't be anything?
oh garrow just lets you go back
i believe he have whatever vanilla boss is here hp
i kinda knew from the jump it was a dead seed. Spoiler Log time?

I need it to be the 12th
Yeah I gotta get to the airport at 9am
Finally, a Mario RPG without Jinx
1 level makes all the difference phanto274Smile
Theoretically you also get more partner and stat upgrades
I got a dokkan youtuber interested in pape randos today
The 1st time I beat bowser I just winged it
I didnt know how to set up danger mario
I fought Bowser without danger Mario (when I first played casually) and the fight took 30 minutes even with good items
People have become too reliant taking half damage lol
I've never been more proud of you
If I fought Bowser again with knowledge of actual strategies that people use, I probably would save a good amount of time
maybe you thought goombario was at the beach and you reallllly want to get him
I'd go to the beach for goombario
We did never specify which summer
Oh, you didn't check Merlow while you were over there? Huh
Could be risky, could be worth it
gl hf o/ Did'cha ever run into the jr music bug again?
perry the platypus, i have no time for these simple games, i haven't even finished my inator, what are you doing here?
let’s see what paper 📝 jinx has in store 🏬 for us
good news: my new shower chair works
i'm not horribly dead after taking one
I'm wondering how you could fix danger mario without beating it with the nerf bat.
I'm shy till i get comfy, then i don't stfu
yeah im usually shy that way too, or if im 1/2 into a drink OMEGALUL
Ya or maybe remove last stand specifically. Then you have that risk using power/mega rush
I can see our 32oz margs are gonna be fire
I'M WILLING TO DIE FOR IT
I’m a social butterfly 🦋 but I do hate bumping into ppl I know in public
So, that 1oz could potentially kick my ass
Cats we stayed up every night at SGDQ till like 6am, and we ordered Taco Bell like 5 times
I dont drink at all so I don't pay attention to alchohol
staying up shouldnt be terrible as long as i have caffeine NiceSoftlock
GDQ has a sponsorship with Red Bull
Yeah, Phantom and I are volunteers, so we have infinite red bull
I never 👎 red bulled or monstered
I can't believe cats is going to be wired on her first ever appearance at GDQ KEKW
idk anyone else whos volunteering besides my one friend, hes host for some runs some nights and i think he does a lot of other stuff too with tech PAUSERS
Gonna be all of us iceblue69LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Phantom and I are gonna play an LADX rando that's got stupid settings
i might volunteer next time. I just wanted my first one to be chill so Gladge
blame iceblue NOTED wait what  HUH
ice 🧊 blue heart 🩵 trying to rig the event on u all
Only pape rando runners get excited for dirt
Note to self, suggest randomized boss patterns.
I still say randomize windmill key
it could be like 4th ruins key
Ralph selling the good stuff today
Its been 0 days since phantom talked to a tree
i may have overgrinded a bit in FF7 lmao
but i do have aerith's level 4 limit break
Power bounce is probably in ruins lol
So.. you gonna deliver that mail???
But but, in rain sleet or shine
Thinking out it, maybe instead of bringing danger mario down, other badges could be brought up. Like I've always thought it would be cool for spin smash to knock over the Koopa bros tower.
But you see that the issue, the tried and true methods always prevails
i mean d down pound is not  bad on him

"It feels to easy" coming from someone like you feels like it wouldn't be terrible wrong for league tbf
even with 3 hearts its easy
Might be something about RPG randos? Generally harder than adventure / jump n run randos, maybe?
Ya its more about the journey than the fights
Or you have RPG randos that give you OP items early on and then they turn into "find the items" rando, ignoring battles
Maybe it's about the good items having requirements? Paper has BP and FP thresholds, Dark Souls has stat requirements for weapons ... whereas some RPG randos are just like "you found it, just equip it"
Oh the minesweeper tracker is back, yay
What do you mean I see nothing wrong, its completely normal
It's 40% per room to be flipped, and 1 in 3 seeds has one entire area chosen at random the gets completely flipped
2 bp power plus, thats gotta be illegal
The train, so it could start one direction and end in the other
ok this is 10x better then mirror mode
just find the 6 bp peekaboo Kappa
Static mirroring's gotta be even worse with seed bleed. You just memorized that this one map is always mirrored, and now maybe it's not anymore
Welp we're lost, better ask the locals for directions
Is there a visual que for desert maps mirroring, I wonder?
Okay, the sun rays don't help, they're always on the right
maybe entering a north/south entrance from the right or left edge of the LZ, to see which way Mario enters the next map from?
the 2 empty spots on your tracker are making me suffer
you should just steal his coin
I just subbed for 3 years it's the least you can do
oh did someone fucking turn off health LOL
Kooper is getting his exercise today
... huh? What BP setting is this
So is it full random bp?
Shuffled was going to be my guess, yeah
Was about to say, it cannot be fully random since that is supposed to cap at 6 BP
I think with beta badges and shuffled, exactly 1 badge can be 9 BP
(which is kind of silly and I'll probably change that)
Well... I think we would get in trouble for answering that
im going back to sleep in a sec
it was -22 when i went to sleep now its -9
am i crazy or is this map mirrored
noo im telling you the moles are on the right side
i cleaned my entire setup and rearranged it yesterday its so clean
the map is mirrored you're lying
are the bp random or fixed
im jus gonna listen now and sleep gö
that cold water at 3am hits differentt
I created something blursed and I could finally share it online
it was a belated xmas gift for friend
they finally got and opened the package
I sent it out after xmas
and they have a PO box
so while it did arrive yesterday, they went in today to get it
and then the were a big meanie and teased me not opening it right away and made lunch and did chores first ch0mskYtilt ch0mskYtilt
Are you 2 hours deep with no hammer? Lmao
Is it me or is twitch tv tv only good for 2 weeks?
you do have 2 hammers u can get
I FINISHED MY FIRST PRIME RANDO!!
I used spoiler log on phazon mines so it didnt drag on too much longer but it did get finished
are yellow squares on map tracker for out of logic checks like if you skip mystery note?
some rooms being reversed is unbelievably cursed
what if the whole time u had the last seed on you
and if seed is not any of that?
want me to check log if it not here?
she just yeeted all of them lmao
np, hope the stream has been good!
Wait is this the 50/50 mirror?
still hate it but less worse lmao
Don't forget a pit run in that too
I spotted that seems like a marvellous seed 🤣
25 hp in phase 1 LMFAO
don't give him the satisfaction of a power bounce death
popesPOGGERS_HF phanto274GG jcogGERS qwilliPauggie jcogGERSC majinPOGGERS
Or just overkill him to dust lmao
My reuniclus sticker just got here
It has been placed upon my headphones
i have removed your reset button, you can no longer reset
Too late, they reset already monadoHands
unplug it and plug it back in wait no
“don’t make fun of me I’ll [reset]”
I forgot about this fight ngl
wow it was that easy for dark matter to return
adeleine already showing off the new FF14 job Pictomancer
kirby no that's not what the movie Face/Off was about
doing mgs1 vr missions for achievements rn lmao
like the missions from 1 not the other game also called vr missions
in the collection there’s an achievement for doing them all. so I’m grinding out the survival mission rn
doing all 10 gun missions back to back
Kirby had some incredible frictional properties
also today i found out one of the new characters in FF14's next expansion is being voiced by a trans woman. so that's cool :3
also the vr missions would be better if mgs1 wasn’t bad
that character is a big beefy cat woman so it's the most accurate usage of the trans cat emote i have on discord i've probably ever had lmao
just realized that probably is delayed on mobile but still like. I typed that the instant I heard lmao
the map screen song for w2 is good. too bad we hear it for like 5 seconds
oh my god a curling rock that is so amazinf
have you seen this game before?
iirc electric and ice is a fridge
only a little bit, never played it
mgs1 skips are limited by the multidisc structure right?
The only time I’ve seen it was when m4 did a few runs of it
isn’t that the same with a lot of ps1 games
phantom so bad smh my head
why didn’t the Kirby games I played have creative power like this. that or I was just bad
I like how most of the bosses in this game exist for like 5 seconds
fire hit box looks like such ass
HOLD up think i need to go clean my ears
there's three instances of waddle ass eating in this game lol
why would you say that? now i cant unsee it!
Kirby can have his cake and eat it too
and it not letting me un time pallos out
excuse me strimmer you're not supposed to find any use in stone kine
damn is pallos not coming back
oh no we had a fight today
Trains work better in this than smrpg
that’s a helluva level to get through
i do not recommend fucking the dynamite, that is not a good bang
is this the only uncommon game that has ice beat fire?
so in pape and the remake ice is stronger interesting.
i think 7tv wasnt loaded in for me
Kirby is my fave emote twitchable
okay fire sword is so cool
it feels that cold right now
where was your jump? kirby's appetite wasn't whetted by waddle dee's ass so he ate your jump input too
does this 100% run also include minigames?
if it doesn't, that's a travesty
why fire when you can darth maul?
Hey you are not permitted to reset
What if I gifted 10 subs
what if I gifted 1 extra sub on top of that
SPARKY NO YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR
Just finished using the new mini croc pot I got for crimmis. Didn't have quite everything for a recepie so I kinda half assed something. Didn't turn out too bad lol
Well that's a little selfish LUL
for a minute I thought the star block broke
i forgot about the one shots
The cool song that reappeared in Planet Robobot and some other niche games
i thought of a dumb meme
Do you just need plain spark?
The missiles that blow up aren't bombs phanto274Smile
hilarious that the very next level has electric as the first enemy
most abilities in this game are super slow
I remember playing this level a ton as a kid
Kirby looks so happy. "I'm an instrument of death and destruction :) "
6-3 is the enemy gauntlet but the one thing I specifically remember is burning+ needle being used for a shard in the floor
Bn3 rando when my hands get tired NotLikeThis
i was hearing the bn3 battle theme all last night
Is there a level that uses the burning+ Cutter (fire sword) ability?
hell yes best song in the game
If course cutter and spark after needle
it was a FUNNY idea tho
if it's stupid and it works, it ain't stupid
this is the actual banger of the game
and with that, Kirby has killed all the oxygen in the universe
i forgot how weird that boss was
you should check my meme first :P
he is very serious. he has a job.
when I was at home, I discovered that I still have my Kirby 64 box and all the original documents in it
still don't know where the actual game is though =\
Do you run this on wii?
the raphnet GC -> N64 adapter lets you bind analogue stick to d-pad. Is that against the ruleset?
yeah that's the setup I've been planning on using when I run this
Phantom you know that people will make up arbitrary rules for no reason
Odd question. Does everyone have a favorite cheese?
GG! phanto274GG That's what I get for being called away Sadge
tie between muenster and pepper jack
my GG is late as well Amish
my grocery has this smoked gouda that is incredible
We have a cheese bar in a Kroger near me as well
now I'm craving cheese real bad lol
You should leave this talk in cheese in the YT vod so you get more ad timers phanto274Smile
I'm eating fresh cut Gouda rn
this isn't wheels of cheese, but there's apparently a chain of humongous gas stations in the South called Bucc-ee's where in each one there's like a huge bbq pit in the store, as well as it being just a giant convenience store
If you go to iowa their core gas station is called kum and go
and soon those Albertson's will just be Kroger
Their food is shit but it's where we stop when we go there for kof so LOL
That's pretty much all we have here other than Aldi
that's what it's like in my neighborhood. It's Fred Meyer or Safeway, each about a mile away. Walmart and Target are a good bit away, though there is a Trader Joe's about 10 minutes out too
I've heard trader Joe's is a good spot
I have no problem with Trader Joe's
I go to target for the pokemon card section. It's always stocked
Any good mom and pop grocery store can't survive now days
walmart is both awesome and terrible at the same time
Sadly the closest thing to my house is Walmart and it's only 5 minutes
because you really want to save 2 cents on everything
my walmart have cheese croissant i really like
i know what this customer was trying to say in this SMS but what they actually said is hilarious
Marketside does make a good Italian hero sub though
it's the Sorry that gets me
Alright chat, which Costco Pokémon you choosing: Glizzet, Grasslice or Slinken?
Never mind I can't tell what the others are NiceSoftlock
Glizzet is a hot dog, Grasslice is a pizza and Slinken is a chicken bake
i got the gnc controller I mentioned in discord
Ah right, they don't have the chicken bake in Canada
31 bucks, but I got to check it out in person first which is a major plus
i heard someone once said what it was and their twitch and youtube channels were instantly deleted no chance for appeal
remember the days of going to a friends house and using their shitty 3rd party controller LUL
Rarely anything needs double of itself
they were at kirby's house and stole his tomato's earlier
Whispy was just living a happy life
I'm guessing that single fire, because of the ability to cancel, is faster than double fire?
those spear dudes are the most annoying enemies to me
did you know there are thorns in the machine fight room you can damage yourself with?
would be funny if there was a check there no one knew about for 20 years LUL
I wonder how many hidden blocks there are total
thats def one way to do it
Something is usually hard to do, doing nothing is awesome
Reminds me of a post people were remixing where one of them was, if you design where you have to wait, you are banned from making games
The original was, "if you design a quest where you have to follow an NPC but they're slower than your running speed but FASTER than your walking speed, you are banned from making videogames for 1 year."
I think stone and ice is used a little too much
Eating lunch and it's fried rice made by a combination
I hate birds that shit in general
Why's the lava got rubber banding?
If the aqua star is good, the neo star is always bad
Does the game specifically tell you you need burning?
Because I didn't see any color in the ice
We should hire those kinds of devs again to make things super cryptic that people go on YT/Google to look up a guide
I go insane listening to this song now
Butter Building is a cool song wdym?
It's a cool enough song Melee stole it
Part of Melee's intro is ripped from Butter Building and one of Melee's menu themes is ripped from SM64 Bowser levels
Probably good to remember after first boulder, go up
holy smokes my shape guessing needs work i got all the colors wrong
I mean look at quiet forest/1-2
Fire makes this a lot easier
Do other runners also hate that poppy bro?
the definition of a game cockblocking.
Honestly that poppy bro might be the play, despite losing 4 or so seconds
This fucking music while kirby is holding a lightsaber
oh man this power up is baller
I always think the cutter matter kinda looks like a crocodile for some reason
i never fought this boss could never get 100%
02 is just some weird egg
need to get it down to 69 place
I can't wait for you to jack into the bed
You need to fill up your retrotink profiles somehow
can't wait to hear the original version of the theme i heard all last night
i had BN3 "slotted in" to BN5DS lol
To be fair, most people probably generate on the site
When? It's gone down briefly a couple times
my only experience with Archipelago is i go to the room and download my oot seed and it was already patched
FWIW I think they also updated the install process in their latest update like a week ago
Archipelago is shit since i have to play on shithawk
im gonna have to ask yuou later how to roll these seeds
wow what a wild place to get that chip
i made a yaml but didnt know what to do after that
@axl_sr I read that as a different y word for a sec
the 1st yaml for oot i had invisible chest setting on Ture by mistake SMILERS
if you do decide to make a tracker for this having spin lite up with a check mark would be nice, or just something to tell them apart lol
have you found a good balance for settings or still experimenting?
"I would like DesertMan D" -Phantom 2024
I still need to play X6 lmao
I still haven’t since the last BN I was in
are these chocolates up to code?
as we know kids are stupid
u really are pulling all the stunts. BN3 retuns!
God I loved those as a kid
I love how America’s response to its broken drug industry was “ah yes lets parasite off of Canada’s drug industry” lmao
didn’t Canada say they were gonna forbid companies from exporting drugs or something
I thought I read something like that
Funny story time: I was watching a bn2 stream and this guy was in koto area for A license, he ran into quickman 3. He made a savestate and was brute forcing quickman over and over.  If he didnt beat quickman it put to the start of scenario 2 when protoman deletes the BBS post cutscene. It was like watching a a bad car accident, you know its horrible but you just cant look away LUL Cheer100
only YOU can prevent lost save data
battle network devs must be devastated that this isn't how the internet evolved 20 years later.
Hey youtube, if you made it this far in BN3 Rando give the video a like and leave a comment. Not a comment person? Then just use your favorite emoji. charizardUp
stream decided to fucking die so hi I’m back lol
Speader p? I barely know her wtf
At least let's go to dinner first
mega man when they said docking this isn’t what they meant
its was good bn3, it raind 18 shurikens
can you reg any of them?
I think with navicust your max MB is like 55?
Woodstyle is a bit op wouldnt u say?
I really want to know the translator that looked at “HARDMAN” as a perfectly acceptable localization
i mean how else would to localized HADOMAN
@pkmn03 its funny when u use water stage the way gets drowned and loses hp is funny as all heck
I bought some dumbells today and as Im laying on the floor my dog was pawing at them evertime I brought them down LUL
like the entire point is he's very very durable
I don’t know anything about BN I’m just here
yes I get what they meant
oh. I was replying to the other thing
you'd be fine if it didn't take wood styles 69 years to charge
bn2 is broken, you can get 4 aqua charges before 2 heat charges
oh I also still have to finish the Castlevania  gba games at some point lmao
when I did bn2 casually on LC I ran wood shield cause shield levels the fastest and had prism on reg so 160 dmg to all tiles is busted too
on average I got 4 charge shots on a single prism LUL
now i'm sad, i'm out of curry
maddy hasn't finished theirs yet, but they also got the "TRIPPLE THAI HOT"
Make sure you fight Dex on the www island
@pkmn03 what are you doing with your life? go finish them wtf
he hadn't beaten... is that bubbleman's cube?
its fine, you found it in Yai's room
what do you think of pape rando rando having key chains? Like if you find kooper and fortress key chain you can clear ch1
yeah, someone suggested it the other day
I just want it for ch 3, screw full clearing and having to come back
how did jenniferr get a hold of giga freeze exactly?
Gl on the like 10-20 mins left KEKW
alpha comp movement could make this last 45 minutes KEKW
Just make it go into the square hole
With all the PAs you have
You literally don't need any of this LUL
ice i love that both of us saw the best placement of programs for that lmao
What happened to the timer? Sorry if that was already answered earlier
ive had that happen a few times,when you hover over it the cursor has weird arrows on it?
yup, that would happen to me with pape. Id open the split files in notepad and manually log it going by vod timings.
over my 750 hours of pape Ive had it happen like 4 times
popesPOGGERS_HF qwilliPauggie jcogGERS majinPOGGERS phanto274GG jcogGERSC popesPOGGERS_SG
quick and easy, unlike making a seed
look i'm sorry i don't start for 4 minutes :P
just got in from a 2 hour drive through the snow
but I was on company time, so it's whatever
either people drive 30 over the speed limit or 50 under during bad weather
I have found yet another hyper annoying athena combo extension that hardly adds any damage but it's there
Demo player is a moron I hope they got fired
Hey you're not allowed to reset again
I'm so excited, I loved this game so much
Gen 3 is my second favorite
@ravenfp land it in bracket for WIK
semi lurkin with this as bg noise whilst I get my ass beat over and over in splatoon lol
@buff00n She's a fuckin point character I aint gonna have the bar for it to matter
in all the time i played as a kid I never saw him suck i don't think lol
I dont consider this a boss What do u feel about it?
more like a blue pecked seal.
I thought he was a penguin?
that logic clearly checks out /s
Seals and Walrus represent royalty. So the beak comes from Hawks.
Eagles are freedomistic while falcons are titans
hot pix in ur local area
you don't get to say that lmfao
The time to focus is now
i learned everything up to aqua star last night EZ
idk if i want to setup my wii for it so im just gonna do it on n64 for now and tank the loads
if i like it ill probably swap
I wanna play 64 again so I might yoink the route just to easily get everything with as little backtracking as possible
ill probably just go slow i didnt really mess with it
i wonder if there's a way to abuse jacob fuzzy mashing stand a on every safejump
i guess all of your characters easily could ye
it was 30 ms not 20 ms
i have a funny hat now
internet telling you "never praise me again"
when will you learn manip and skip to 1:05
remember when this woulda killed you
but now we get to see ash's fingernails
jacob definitely does that more than anyone else in this state
i should show jacob 646C dp punishes meterless when he jumps over your dp like that
he wears it down but when he's fighting the electriciy makes it stand up
okay he was begging to get dropkicked there
Can chip kill in this game?
time to swap my gamecube controller shells
OMG the timing my feed crashes and so did things
i thing you saw me talking to morph about it
I soaked my OEM shell and thats all dry now
okay i recorded the athena dp punish but i will not send it until relevant
is there sowfware I need to download?
interesting, OEM gamecube controller has an extra bracket for the triggers the the smash branded ones lack
Oh dear. My area has wind storms up through tomorrow up to 60mph gusts. Really picking up now. Hope power holds
its just to help keep the spring in place
"Thought about killin myself" -Steve Harvey
The Storm will be kicking Butt
im useing OEM triggers and plastic buttons, just swapping the boards.
I use the trigger plugs just for pape rando only
so this white controller was sealed in box, I used it for the first time in Dec and after opening it the edges are so nast y
what do you mean you don't want meat that tastes like a white suburban mom cooked it via boiling to death with no seasoning
now when someone comes over I can give them a shiney new white controller with a shitty stick LUL
gotta remember its not gg time yet
how are you liking LA rando?
the return of my fave woot woot!
cool, Ive really been enjoying prime rando myself
a few lights have flickered a bit. This is fine.
buttons are the fun part lol
the legend of super mario jasmenPog
and done!! Indigo controller with white cable and white controller port lol
this is just amazing Luigi playing in my fave
and button test passed, Prime is a good button test cause it uses everything LUL
I return with food. Link is uh, lookin a lil different lol
Hmm i might have to try this rando
Was there any unnecessary resetting? Kappa
the worst part about how bad mexico connections can be is how fucking good the players are
my winner's connection was awful, my loser's connection was good but i was tilted
i genuinely immediately messaged yurikov "honest salty question, how do i fight rock in rollback?"
didn't drop below 100 the whole set
i think thrashboy has PC issues
he's restarted and immediately fixed the issue before
wero is a lot more chill about online tournaments you can win that
el rosa you can win too but that's up to god
oh no i mean the grappler gods
el rosa will decide to be correct or he won't
you're gonna wakeup shatterstrike and he's gonna forward roll through it on a read
el rosa probably loses to anyone on rng online
i don't think he's really trying to win like that when i watch him in netplay tournaments
dont you get blue max off any level 3 dropkick?
oh just waiting for the stun
its insane to me how much you would love blazblue combos
i was checking on the website for this and i can do just dungoens er that's cool
idk cf rollback kinda sucks regardless
valk is just actually goat fg design in general
i was thinking about that earlier
genuinely fantastic FG designs outside of KOF
his entire character is being a scumbag too
"here's to a fair fight" is such a good intro line
yeah and then he immediately hides his psycho power behind his back LMAO
that's why he's always holding a hand behind his back he's literally a liar
i need to actually confirm my kim ch j.CDs from everywhere on the screen
i can clearly see where i win every set
i want to see every el rosa set
damn that was the forward roll
but that was the forward roll!
oh you probably play the rock i fought in winners
i think you win against both of your next opponents
hey i said i thought you beat rosa today
like im not gonna lie im here to watch you suffer
every time jacob doesn't kill we now have a game to link him
you hit the microdash combo every time you went for it
you went for the easy combo twice and dropped it once
i should play hinako just to spite your najd execution is what you're saying
we will neve get that sword
im not playing mary i have self respect
i will continue to play my men with excessive cleavage
ryo's gi covers up too much tiddy
even kim is hard to play
oh no i meant he doesn't have the correct amount of cleavage
anyway that was rock/isla/sylvie i lost to
yeah my checks were just getting blown up in games 1 and 3
yebutt my checks were just buttting blown up in games 1 and 3
game 2 i had the spacing right
i shoulda flexed just running at him with j.A more
ms was at a nice 124 i saw in the lobby
yeah this is what i figured
yeah thats exactly what i expected lmao
i need to sometimes just see 130 ms and say "i cant play reactive here"
like im actually kinda tilted how easy that was for you
i dont think reading that dude hopping was exactly hard lmao
looking over AP for emerrald and loving what im seeing
my ideas to stuff it just didn't work and i tilted hella hard
just what I can see on the main page
oh, it should be in the pop tracker discord then
oh im in an unofficial pop tracker channel and they dont have it
this is it, says its for pop tracker
im p sure that super is 200 min
when you've been fighting iori since you were in the womb i can imagine reverse anti-air inputs are in his dna
yeah shun gets run over hard
so being the goat is necesarry
brruh, there are so many settings to go thru lol
and I can just keep using that over and over?
so its like a settings string
I finally got around to watching my redemption yesterday what a nightmare that turned out to be lol
I got 9th in tns I actually beat a couple high/top level mexico
you need to only use this sprite
Legend of Mario: The seven Instruments
Back when I was a kid, I used to think it was the BIGGEST flex to have max rupees on the GBC Zelda games
don't you have to attack his ass?
Could it be the Mario sprite? Idk if that would matter or not
bosses are a bunch of haters tonight
ok were getting in the clear
I wonder what the spoiler log will say and if Bosses difficulty was heightened.
Just tell me how much you'd like to fu.. Wait fuck it's not a person or a degen
Is this the one with the Mai Mai or am I think albw?
I had so much trouble with the floor bot things first time
Ever thought of doing seasons/ ages randomizer??
I know seasons like pape runners know pape 64 LOL
hopefully sooner than later but i havent done any learning today
im basically just following your pbs since the guide's videos dont work
its at least a pretty straightforward speedrun for the most part
i might end up setting up my wii but i really dont want to lol
it just looks nicer on wii too
I mostly lurk, but I've really been enjoying the Kirby runs
i cancelled my pro nintendo membership or whatever but i was also thinking of just renewing that so i can play switch
the problem with setting up my wii is i think i have to re homebrew it from scratch and ResidentSleeper
i get two pretty consistent getting the first hit with the backburner
apparently theres a newish beta feature for auto captions and its really funny
i think its an obs thing tho
its not on this stream but ive been watching it elsewhere today lol
Oh crap, my sub ran out. Gimme a se
Hey. Friendly reminder. No resets :)
I come for the sub 1:30
Why did the shark swallow Gordos?
And why didn't it die from them? WutFace
also why is it oil spill? p4ntzThink
Clearly they're related to the Paper Mario Spear Guys. Tryna get their revenge on you
i kind of want to replay this game
switch version has input lag still right?
oh I thought it was an emulator issue
And as a Kirby game rule, you'll lose it to a regular hit for no reason
I just recently got expansion pass that’s why I asked LUL
wait they still haven’t patched the audio stuff?
I just assumed that was fixed by now lmao
Boi that was a Waddle Doo
This game has very strange invincibility frames
I've noticed a few times you'll be mid-fireball and still take a hit
Unless it's literally frame perfect damage
I think it’s funny that n64 is probably what most people bought it for, and n64 is the least polished emulator lmao
beats pokepark runs at least right? lol
this run have a lot of bs in it
I’m sure Nintendo totally has a plan of how to preserve these emulators once the switch lifecycle ends (they don’t)
There should be an option to take off Kirby's shoes Kappa
But can anyone ACTUALLY confirm if they are shoes?
kirby, get out of the fuckin 😳
ah, one of those then, gotcha
it's an hour and a half of a run
as opposed to 20 minutes of First Cycle or Prologue
also it’s not like something like Complete Saga where it’s like. a 3 hour run or something
yeah Lego SW TCS is like an approximately 3 hour run
mostly because there’s a bit over an hour of unskippable cutscenes
yeah summoning salt does good stuff
I know I make that joke every time but. c’mon.
Hiya Phantom phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Smile good luck
also it’s funny that the NSO versions of Mario Tennis and Golf don’t have any of the gameboy content
fun fact. there actually wasn’t enough space on the cartridge for all the e-reader levels in Mario Advance
I finished something based today monadoWreath
how how this and the minecart level are basically the same
is that an advanced long pillow with a cup holder?
Let Kirby life his best life as a pole dancer smh
lol i was just thinking that
you had destroyed one of the green things by jumping on it, I think. Either that or powerup
They have to get the most of this song since it never ever comes up again in the game (at least to memory)
do you want to try some fast strats I made for the vine room? I'm wondering if any are easy enough for a beginner
sorry I guess I should have explicitly asked if I could post the link specifically
there's 2 strats so hopefully one works
just watching this part make me want to play dkc
yeah this part of the game likes to screw you over
Like for hitting it or avoiding damage? What are you struggling with
Tap down/left (or down/right or whatever) repeatedly so you're not holding the directions
that will allow you to dodge while not moving out of attack range
doesn't quite work in text form though
IT'S NOT MY FAULT. I HAVE DYSFUCKSIA
My fave thing about kirby is just all the nihilism and cockiness of the enemies tbh. How they laugh about setting off a boulder that doesn't crush you or divebombing to try and kill u but hurting themselves instead
All with a big ol :D face
Looks like you just need to mash faster for a 2-cycle
don't think there's anything else you can do
I did that in a relay
I literally just raid komari and he raided into you LUL
phanto274Rage that song was a banger how could you
can you lend me your emmy cart COPIUM
i play teested to first gym last night
no way  rubix cube was just solved in less than a minute
did you use extra sources for your vertical tracker? cause the emo tracker broadcast view is horizontal
sure, ill hit you up later
pokecenter speedup is so nice too
Raichu  will get a new move at level 6
i was looking at the tm KEKW
the test seed I tried first gym gave surf, it was funny seeing the map tracker open up LUL
Every time I think about Emerald randomizer I think of the time Brandon started with Registeel and only used Explosion
But it's before you can catch more pokemon
a bat having fire is funny as heck
can berries berry loacations be added to the pool?
Nice. I didn't miss too much
full heal let’s go best check
double wild encounters would be sick, like it has a 10% chance or something
Rayquaza been eating candy, its mouth is blue KEKW
funny thing for me was just the other day I was talking with Ouro about modern pokemon has all these double format moveset but no double battle in the main adventure. This rando fixes all of that
shoutouts the kids playing video games in class
ive never seen that ivysaur sprite
roxxane after beating her own gym be like
isnt it based on your trainer ID?
I think it’s just box skins in the regular game
good to know we dont have to do that
you will know for next time i guess
I love how role play lets you get air lock onto random pokemon, it’s fun
you have to beat the gym for this check
because then he gives you the letter for Steven back at the ha
If I found a rare berry in rando I can trade that to my vanilla cart right?
I think the e reader data has to be on there though?
depending on what berry it is
couldnt you do rock smash in the cave or do HMs still require badges?
I know you can only have so many rare berry types on a cart at once
because it’s all the same dummy item, ereader uses it as a vehicle to make the berries
I love the e-reader it was so weird but. oddly charming
I always imagine chuggaa saying it
how do your key item randos usually go?
I’ve played emerald a few too many times phanto274Smile
im so glad pokenav is vanilla
so you can set wonder guard to be disabled entirely
i bet this wont be a babypokemon seed
might be the version of randomizer you're using then, it's separate from the key item randomizer ... part
sableye wonderguard please be possible that would be funny…
Yeah AP doesn't have all the options of the native randos for a lot of the games
oh i guess i'm an old hat then lol i used to have to use a batch file and change everything manually
Oh didn't realize they added it that recently. Been looking for games besides OOT to learn for multiworlds
i stopped doing key item rando because of how tedious the setup was :) sounds great that they're automating it
i did a pokemon emerald and crystal full key item rando and random warps (that can take you between games) It was rough lol
it's another project similar to archipelago  the crystal game is technically a emerald base remake of crystal on gen3
if you don't like fan game remakes then you'll probably want to pass :p but it was fun for about 5 hours until i got completely lost with where to go next
i'm trying to find what level of randomize this is... are hidden items possible to be key items?
you get used to it after a while lol... but now i feel nerdy
You'd basically just have to have the maps up which sounds tedious
you'll have to buy the strategy guide lol
i have them too - i don't remember if they do or not .. i'll completely take your word fori t
the old strategy guides were relatively barebones for Pokemon iirc
i watch a lot of full key item races and that's how i learned basically
I have it right in front of me, looks like they listen the hidden items but not wherre to find them
they got better after like B/W I think
i dislike b/w because the battles take too long :)
it’s like “hey it’s somewhere on the screen” and it’s like WideKirby thanks
don’t forget to charge it between uses though! phanto274Smile
wait, is that how the HMs are listed?
metal gear collection got an update on consoles the other day btw
you can multiworld with starcraft 2? wtf lol
you have to deliver the parcel
which I don’t think you have
imagine if Brawly has the package
I looked away, did you remember to turn off animations
the non-archipelago key item randomizer discord is still up with functioning links if you wanted to do that instead :)
i think the main appeal of this variant is you have control over the randomized options you choose
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i hope they add all of these options to archipelago and keep making it better
i'm trying to make one now, i'd have to agree
I agree about the UI. But love the ability to do cross game multiworlds so I just deal with it
yeah they literally have to make a guide for every game
rock smash wher eyou saved peeko
Yeah just a stand alone yaml generator that doesn't suck would go a long way
might be a case of "I know backend dev but I don't know frontend dev"
I was surprised I had to download a client just to make a seed
is the tracker automated at least :)
that's how you meet someone in pokemon, you battle their pokemon to death
I think ill just gen a bunch of seeds at once so I dont have to worry about it
ah busted Gen 3 surf I miss you
I mean it IS Hoenn after all 7.8/10
rated for having just enough water lol
dont talk to mr stone dont get pokenav LUL
does he give you another check tho?
they just wanted to give you their money
How stressing has this shit been? Been in and out finishing dq 11 shit phanto274Sip
She doesn't love you Sadge just like my love life
I love rando in this game because you met the most wack shit known to man
Wonder guard is a thing in this seed Pichu, we saw a Donphan with it earlier
just wanna make sure im understanding this right, every seed I want to roll I need to gen a new room on the site?
Nah fuck that I'm doing oot rando
ill ask for details later lol
It's fine as a multi world stand alone client, but standalone nope
Did you see the trailer for MvDK remake that tells you they're actually adding some shit to said remake?
I was never really sure if that was a remake or a new game
its a fun one and done
I liked it back in the day but don't think I wanna pay $50 or whatever they want to play it again
apparently, Time Attack is a mode they're adding
guess golbat doesn't like you enough
they added a casual mode to M VS DK in case you thought it was too hard on GBA LMFAO
How do you make that game more casual
Luigi just backseats and tells you what to do
she's got that 20 / 20, gaddamn
why are there so many random assholes on that one route
they upped the trainers because they were really proud of their battle theme
supposed to get cold this weekend
I'm going too. Supposed to be between like 20 and 50 all week lol
getting down to -10 for a couple days here
that's a TM that exists ;D
we should be allowed to spray trainers in the face w/ repels if we don't wanna fight
You staying at the venue? I've got a buddy that lives in the area so I'm gonna be coming and going
that way i could get sick with everyone else
Yeah I can only swing it because I don't have to pay for the hotel, thisll be my first one
That's the way to do it. I'd basically just have to room with strangers though, no one I know very well ever goes
you're welcome for the gifted sub to komari_ btw Kappa
I'm already waiting for the thread for gdq for who caught covid there
I mean if you use something called common sense it's hard to get sick
East side north west, checks out
this is when I call quits, good luck
when i lived in SC there were quite a few streets with NE western ave or SW eastern st
Yeah just head east on northwest south avenue
they're all relative to the mega church in the middle of town i guess lol
this swimmer's the wrong trainer class
now that surely is a sight. a small child flying in the wind on a large snorlaz
I for some reason have memories of snorlax having fly in stadium and it being a ridiculous animation but it might just be a fever dream I had at some point
It wished it wasn't level 14
rigby, slopdop and i commited war crimes
we won like 95% of our unite games
there's a fresh new emote in the smrpg discorf
I was able to figure it out with the web site. I genned 15 seeds so I know how to do it now lol
So if I wanted ro roll bn3 I'd have to remove the yaml from that folder?
I like the GTA V Trevor haircut.
You know I love you. Haha.
I uh... I've been doing a whole lot of the smokey smokey.
Lots of CBD stuff to calm my anxiety and all that.
Played anymore funky game mods since last time?
Oh nice. What was this one, this time? I remember the find the endings one we did.
ohh that 1 i miss some of it
Oh, neat. I'll keep an eye out for it.
If you don't know the badge names just look at the trainer card lol
Some manner of FF Tactics or Tactics Ogre game in July because my Birthday? : D
Oh, but that's not my birthday. kekw
Standing in the rain no less
i don't think you beating this before i go to Bedge
what the last stream before gdq?
Oh yeah. I'm probably going to try to tune into GDQ Live.
And just keep it running the whole time.
I'm excited to see the shiba speedrun for obvious reasons
There's like... 40+ runs that I want to see this year.
The only runs I'm gonna be doing is to the marg restaurant
If it's 5-10 minutes from the hotel, no
But is that taco bell 24 hours?
To be fair, I used to watch the entire show from start to finish on like, two hours of sleep.
I'm not even kidding. It was bad.
fuck morp coop run is at 1034pm Sadge
There's a taco bell that's open till 4am
I found my bike 10 minutes in lol
Close to the hotel, like maybe a mile
I mean, I also have uber eats plus
Make someone drive through the snow
its over around 330 am hm guess i am staying up for that
Yeah i'm canceling my uber eats after GDQ lol
oh so you cant progress if you dont find CUT or SURF or stuff liek that?
sounds cool, have you bumped into any legendary pokemon randomly
Well, I'm going to take off again. I'll try to say hai again soon. Have fun at GDQ and don't do anything I wouldn't do. So, don't do anything. At all. But really, be safe! Catching anything, airborne or otherwise. kekw
Phantom is gonna do everything now
would love to see your good rod
" Roleplay is REALLY good " Phantom
i was just playing totk today, love that game
personally i think the newer zeldas are better than the old ones, is that a bad take
i been thinking about trying link awakening rando but i probably have to use the map tracker
@Extracupanails new Zeldas (specifically BotW and TotK) aren't BAD, but they're definitely not what I want from zelda
are they talking about breath of the shit and tears of the boredom
Report this grunt, this bastard's using WATER
Gonna petition someone if Maxie's running Water-types
nice my internet took a shit
both of whcih are, sadly, better than was I currently have
Every game they throw in a little fuck you but they mix it up every time
itemfinder is the equivalent of finding peekaboo badge
ill let you figure out the settings before i give it a shot
ask the old man if the island is here today FeelsOkayMan
my good nonbinary bitch, what are you still doing up
have u tried asking Kyogre about water falling? I've heard it's very good at doing that
that's ur problem! u asked Kyogre to make the sky fall, not RAIN. Silly!
hey now, they could be *rivals* for all u kno
ur still at it do u have ur digits left?
:v you technically need it for Gen 2 and 4 idk what you're talking about
Kyogre, representing Gen 3: Fuck you landwalker you thought I made the SKY FALL instead of EXPANDING THIS DO-cean.
YOU DO NOT GET TO GO FREE DO NOT PASS GO GOOD DAY
I forget, what's the purpose of turning the generator off for again
You *did* see two freaky looking electrodes, that's worth the trip
I can spare you the misery of low tide lock
This guy looks like he's having an existential crisis in the worst place on this Pokearth
You are not low tide locked
and now I will get my giggles on in the bg
Fat i laughing his butt off in the house
I can also say that 123 girl is dead
im laughing my butt off. darn typing
Castform hands u some goggle like glasses. 'damn bitch you live like this'
No. You punish him for going out for milk and never coming home cause he's Slaking
How many of the other gym leaders have you done?
oh, does it treat like, you beat a gym leader as overall collective progress vs individual progress or st?
It's me I'm toxic and I rain down filth on unsus- wait I had a bit earlier where birds were innocent of this
I've met some fine lookin black belts who look nothing like black belts
I kinda wish I had stayed up with it but... it was so expensive : (
Potted plants block something unless you have something known as an e reader
"The e-Reader functionality was inaccessible in Pokemon Emerald versions outside of Japan but is still within the code and can be enabled to accept eCards."
are the shiny things not items
so yeap, you were Norman Reedus and his Rattata Fetus locked
Storage Key I think is needed to get over there
but I'm unfamiliar and google is falliable
good thing you got all the extra xp exploring the ocean
Someone didn't grow up navigating Sky Pillar 😏
This is exactly how Kieran ends up fucked up and evil
Maps don't help navigating the Mach Bike
i always liked how they just have 2 regular dudes blocking the league
they go to 55 if I remember, I think that's about average for E4 levels
Ampharos with an Assault Vest is very funnee
Oh I forgot you can straight up use your bike here 😭
a *little* weight for big fights to have higher BST
it's the voice of Gen 3 here to personally ensure you cannot move forward
I, too, would pull out a Salamence before Corphish
I've seen Persian take down Garchomp before in gen 4, shit can be scary
but that's with Stab last resort
eh, better to be overprepared. It's the only reason I got away with first try Volo
oh right hips out is the champ here
can confirm btw, storage key was necessary
Poliwag is proud of surviving only to perish
that is objectively the correct play
damn, I see how it is

ok, obs is being bad for me but it looks like they're going through at least
I slightly inched forward and COMPLETELY fucked up my ankle
I made money TO'ing cuz FUCK playing in bracket
cool $80 for standing around yelling at people
Chicago majors are built different, I guess
Hell, ComboBreaker's paying $40 per bracket, so I'll absolutely be fiending to run some CB brackets
I volunteered under the assumption I was "volunteering", not getting paid
the pool that took the longest was KOF, which made sense
Smash was fine until it became Bo5 for some silly reason
smash shouldn't be bo5 until top 32 minimum tbh
Bo5 should be for GFs, imo
alright idk about just grands KEKW
@morpheus080 I'll shake on Top 8, final offer
them starting bo5 as early as r1 pools is crazy to me
damn malon can just clip like that
she should be getting these checks
Bo5 to get outta pools is crazy
Minish Cap but it's multiplayer a la Sonic 2 co-op
I've learned I become unashamedly biased when I'm hungry as running bracket
if you're down the set, I'm rooting against you so I can go get food sooner
this is so funny. ha ha ha ha ha hu ha hu hu
@buff00n this is just normal behavior tbh
we always rooted for the person in winners at my locals so we could go eat sooner lmao
wait does that actually bother people lmfao
Rolling in Minish Cap is why MC is the best top-down Zelda
have they ever played a 3d zelda
Yo gl with bad game I mean good game
Stare not sure if i should BOP swift or not oh Yo swift
Do it tiger and you will regret it
Dud exo give you the plague
I think buff00n is falling asleep can you scream real quick
if you start losing I'll unplug the wifi
one ☝️ hr and still not beaten someone is majorly rusty. hope trip went well.
where dose this game fall in the zelda timeline
the beginning like skyward sword 🗡️
have you ever done a pokemon randomizer
the dragon 🐉 somehow becomes fairies 🧚‍♀️ in oot
that PR i sent you, did that cover the apartment in rustboro that was missing from the tracker?
maybe I didnt actually send it then?
the hot springs was added, and the other 2 i found was kid on second floor of apartments, and rusturf tunnel item east. Ill look into it later.
oh yeah you in vegas now huh
yeh I saw it. I'm thinking about submitting too
I can get up there pretty cheap
remember the game before and how awful it was
i remember the audio to this day
raven didnt remember so i showed them the mwsf run
"I never knew what it was called we just made sounds to reference it LMFAOOO" -Raven 1-27-2024

vibin and having leftover chineese from lunch
good 😊 to see my fave boss
oooh, is that a snorlax plush I see? cute
yo gl, nice rupee and arrows
KEKWait ok game the 1 rrupee 5 arrows was funny the first time
a year should have 13 months. Just think about it, if we had 13 months instead of 12, every month would be exactly 28 days. The first would always be a monday and the 28th would always be a sunday. Every month would have exactly 4 weeks instead of 4.25749638712500093 and we would properly align ourselves with the cycle of the moon. Cheer100
Why does Vati have an eye in his crotch
No way we getting bonus content!
sounds like a grand ol time
Ok its go time and ur wearing my fave tunic
It's been a bit. How are you doing?
Oh sure. Hope you feel better! The weather has been so weird where I'm from. I hate climate change due to global warming
I feel that. I'm in Wisconsin. The ice and fog is messing with me
Yeah I totally understand. I feel like the weather is very brutal with the transition and then if it's supposed to stay cold it should. It was in the negatives here last week but now it's like 40. I don't like it
Not good for the immune system. But at least Link can handle the desert
Apparently my previous message didn’t go through
I know it has to do with internet
The last time it happened wasn’t even a twitch problem unfortunately
It was so bad before I had to use cellular data
The remote bombs were kinda hype imo
inever seen that room filled like that
I beat this and this is blowing my mind lol
thought i was watching speedrun lol
Fire is one of the worst things in this game
I might need to replay this
@ghirahim_xc yeah this is fun to run
It looks fun but I’ve also  seen not fun moments as a speedrun lol
link between worlds is probably mine tbh
This ones so cool i like it
I also need to get on Golden Sun at some point
i am slightly less depressed, my mom got me a lego set for my birthday :3
yeah thats the plan, thats what ive been working on the last few days
but i hope youre well phanto274Bless

so you saying bowser might sucks ass to fight
how many badges are we working with?
this luck is a fluke KEKW
oh looks like you be fine
My house is almost back in 1 piece now! Just need electrician to hook in new ac and fixtures 😆
what are you thinking like 8??
what is the goal with this trick
ok is one check i understand but wow
nice when they found new tricks
Since when has this baby had different colors?
You'd expect me to realize huh, well that's one for me for forgetting shit probably
good lord how many Tayce T items can you get
Woke up to see you on my Switch. Couldn't tell if this was Stream or a vod at first.
Rather than getting cooked items can you change it and get battle items eg shooting stars?
1FP spook what a scam Madge
How bad is this badge pool
How restricted is the pool today?
we love a good fan smack
don't worry, usually i say d-meh-yr
Just the distracted drunk stream i needed.
okay done with my casual FF1 rando
i did music rando and temple of fiends past music was the fucking VICTORY THEME
that didn't get old. nope. not at all.
FF1 Rando? Never seem that before, how long is the usual run
i mean depends on the flags really
this took about... 3-4 hours i'd say?
i also had a randomly generated OW so that was fun
why suspicious? there are quite a few checks left, aren't there?
welcome to endgame of rando hell
you got to be shitting me right now he was in the mail bag
i'll be going now, good luck and gnight!
okay just took my new cane for a test walk
i was able to get through two laps around my building instead of one

omg u went there ur gonna go for a second. peepoStay
is this an awful shop spawn?
oh my fucking god i just saw the funniest thing
a really shitty AI generated news article with the title "Understanding the Mysterious Aura of the Areola Borealis"
just a screencap of it of course
but it also has the great line "we will explore the true meaning behind the areola"
Hii Phantom phanto274BLANKIES I'm finally here! Just worked 11 hours str9ngSadge
Better now that i can watch rando phanto274Smile
they absolutely choked the 2nd half
Phantom can you say "fuck you buff00n" rq its on the hotel room tv rn
Welp, best of luck getting either of those from Cley
wouldn't have anything to do with hundreds of other people in a relatively small space for a week either...
Did u take part in the massive group photo of zelda runners?
if i get sick blame phantom NOTED
also did your capture rig change? Seems less...blurry?
well Spitle got sick from that.
did you always have that? Or get it recently?
why not Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks
granted, I bet most people at the show probably have clocked a time in "2D" Zelda games, so that would be a large photo
I know, I'm just being a nitpick
ok now this is just abusive
where is the speed in this run? 🙂
yay a decent badge and decent cost
plot twist, kooper is the 5th koopa bro, and has been trying to earn their respect his whole life

I wonder if the Kirby one is out there
In ascii tiger KEKW I know the emote exists
I'm pretty sure there's a rule 34 corollary that speaks to characters having images of them smoking weed on the Internet somewhere
Yep sounds about right for the sa2 community
that is indeed a snoop dog sized blunt
What's funny is it comes from sa2 KEKW that's the origin of it
why are they're so many cookies / cakes lying around this seed
He went to kick sonics ass because he didn't get his Zaza break
I left my weed at home, what do you want from me
peepoIgnore HappyHippo man look at this hippo
To be fair I'm also on mobile, I just have most emotes remembered in my keyboard to how they're written KEKW
i just walked in and they were there idk what to do
SadgeBusiness has anyone seen my calculator, i think i left it with my kids toys, maybe he put it in the toybox?
You say that as im eating spicy mcchicken
I had 2 for 3 50
I’m now getting tempted to order some @ravenfp
Phantom how hot do you take your showers we're having a discussion
Buff00n is being a pussy ab hot water
I do hot water, not "burn my skin to the bone, hot"
gotta wash the covid off somehow
I used to enjoy cold showers. now that I’m much older I do like warm then hot showers too
gotta wash the covid off somehow
The switch twitch app is so shit
I downloaded it long before they removed it
i didn't even realize that was ever a thing lmao

at school I hand-soldered a 96-pin microcontroller to a PCB and it worked
of course, that was after I destroyed two others...
yeah I can understand not wanting to do so after that
when PM was hot, I grabbed 2 or 3 white JP GC controllers for at least $20 each
Buff00n jusr played a Mario kart race with a guy named cuntfucker
still, there's the answer. That's a sweet price point to hit
see OEM Joy-Con prices. $70 for a pair is bananas
I'll be sure to yell at George or Kham
I do hear good things about the Hori pads
mmm, see I don't like clicky buttons
I've been stuck into 8bitdo controllers ever since I bought their Pro+ controller
would strongly recommend their Pro2 or Ultimate Controller
Ultimate has the Xbox layout, if that helps
Ive grown a deep attachment to my ps4 pad
These seeds today are really mental tests

Rogue probably doesn't approve - but i've been mixing the Rogue skittles but not skittles flavor w/ fireball, it's better than i expected :]
Yesterday was my bday!! Im 20 now!!
You buy any of their waifu cups yet ?
I have like 6 of the stainless steel 24 oz one from gfuel and ... yeah i hear you about having too many of these things

Imagine failing that watt action command lol
our tap water is disgusting well water and as such i order 5 gal jugs of some spring water. But on the bright side the dispenser makes it really cold
Yup that lag always gets ya

Gonna head to bed now, good night little2636Wave
Reset audio is broken again btw
and I'm usually the one who's borked because Twitch likes to be dumb
Surely you can roll the A/B right?
twitch is like "you should stream metroid prime remastered." Despite remasted having less average viewers than gamecube prime LUL
im pretty sure if you inhale a copy star and an enemy you only get the copy star. But I might be wrong about that.
But isn't fire dashing the most riveting content?
Mashing repeatedly is tough, part of the reason I haven't learned BHS is it hurts my hand after like 5 minutes of attempts
That didn't bug me quite as much but maybe cause I was a lot worse at getting it consistently so I had more breaks lol
I don't think I will even ever attempt TTYD cause of that
Turbo is just so nice for speedrunner longevity tbh
We'll get to see kirby eat waddle dee's ass again phanto274BLANKIES
No one tell Pallos that Kirby is here
Rock cutter sure is an ability
Had to switch to PC cause mobile is bugged
Is there anything in this game that does more than 1 segment of damage
I think anything with water is cringe
I seriously expected at least one death on that first level
More surprised that didn't stop them
You either have a whatever neo star or cringe neo star
It was good. How goes kirby 64 runs?
I kinda wanted to learn this run. I have the cart but never really tried to learn it
Doesn't the leaderboard have it separated or something though? I foret
Honestly I'd like to see an actual expansion to combo Kirby abilities in a future Kirby game like certain combos cane solve some/most problems and some where it's hyper specific, what star allies did was close but not fully explored
the ddd on fire animation is kinda cool
Why don't people run on switch? input lag or?
I never actually tried a 64 game on switch, never paid for the thing I think
I don't understand how nintendo thinks that's okay
And Nintendo will never fix it
hasn't the 64 stuff been available for years
Then again I know n64 games are really hard to emulate from what I hear
Sparky is going through it rn
are you playing this on og console?
your stream makes it look like a ps5 game
Didn't know it was that bad
idk how people have that kind of perseverance
I can't imagine grinding a run like that on wii u
I bring it up cuz of how much worse it is in comparison
Also I don't wanna get spoiled
Cuz i do plan to play smrpg one day
its go time lets rock these fools
i have been craving a double chocolate cake like its nobody buisness
i think its another term for pound cake
this looks like it would be fun on handheld
The derust is real just finish out strong no quit
Punch the bee in the dick Madge
At this rate I think the game has the mutual hate you have for it
the run ender is over gbye swordy
the hippomouse is such an odd enemy fusion. like what drugs were the og team on
PogBones popesPOGGERS ghunzoEPOGna minimi6Pog PogChamp majinPOGGERS tippiPog
btw I was meaning to ask since you moved in you took Cley's room right?
You can sleep at night knowing I was in that room hacking a 3DS
They are surprisingly easy to hack after all
@buff00n did you see the Sonic x Shadow stuff?
is that difficult to set up?
It is high time. And whenever u get to kirby its ok.
You killed a man and took his hammer you monster
Wow Mario is an amazing actor
Mario showed his best chops in this game
And he literally made the castle shake
"Kid, I lay pipes on regular basis. I know EVERYTHING about PIPES."
ok Bowmoder we need ya beat
no one you say? *levels to spite you*
this guys mouth movves like a muppet LUL
for emerald what do you think of starting with fly? The one I did last night I didnt get it until mt pyre
have you been sleeping as much as samus and link
i been going to sleep around 1am ish and waking up at noon
fave portion of the run time
remembered why I buy games from best buy, less than a week ago I got Persona 5T for 30 bucks and tonight it went for 20 so they refunded the difference
oh nice u did a run back
yeah I don't look forward to my next move whenever that is.
how much did the route change?
ooh I thought this was bowser strats but the fire bomb, nice
giving the enemies iframes instead of you is cursed
@stavros12c34anenoglou they're about to get axed
i beat crystal kaizo+ e4 r1. im on my 2nd attempt. kinda godlike.
He's not at kanto yet so
they made crystal kaizo+ which is more geared towawrds nuzlocking
no fucking level 130 pokemon lol
oh i had really good rng my stream so mightve taken yours
He survived like every rng point of e4
Platforming in this game looks so ass
I despise games with this camera angle that make you jump around
the nimbus land entrance sucks casually
gotta have several dozen lights in the same scene
are the crystals on the chandelier also dynamic lights?
No tekken 8??? Say hii to mvd for me lol
Sweet  glad u all doing alright
Pretty good just chilling playing some tekken

U getting princess peach right phantom
Noice I'll be heading there all of March ^_^
thanks for reminding me of state of play
I hope they announce Tembo the Badass Elephant remaster
I cant wait for the king calamari reveal trailer!!
so statte of play is gonna be sub 2:45
youtube has a chat? thats wild
twitch stream has a countdown its less than 2 minutes now
could make a short out of something
I remember they had to stop the sonic anniversary livestream cause the Twitch stream started ahead of the youtube stream
you are 30 seconds ahead of the twitch stream my friend is reacting to LUL
show us more Sega classic project like the jet set radio reveal
Mature content Sonic X Shadow kiss confirmed
I don't pay attention to the AAA(???) Playstation releases
Can I take a well deserved break with her but in real life?
this is such a slow reveal
I would do it all for Eve
i just hope sonic isnt a buggy mess
This game uses AI art btw
Worth noting Biolizard was a boss in Sonic Generations 3DS
I just saw the godzilla movie so im on board
new game from irrational devs PAUSERS
it looks like bioshock to a t
best part of the sonic reveal is kids are gonna go to google and type sonic x shadow KEKW
looks like it could be good, could be bad
Think of your wife as a beacon
we gonna get any more release dates?
i only am bothered by vr games because i dont have space for it Madge
500 bucks for a VR? hell no
ok phantom will be a vr sreamer
i cant experience the games so its not fair and they should not be made KEKW
black tiger, google sonic x shadow
yeah no i am good lmao
i played the 1st 1 and i sleep
I wanna see that ninja turtle game called ronin
i mean i might be interesting in this cuz of the time it take place in
kinda like the show Blue eyed Samurai
I love they stole asassin creed eagle dive
yeah let me just buy this game again for full price how about no
@blacktiger51 dlc the cringe of the universe
some dlc is fine like monster hunter iceborne
Im expecting kojima to wear a mask like that now. 2 hands cover the face LUL
Thank you kojima for black goop
that reminds of shigaki the number one villain of mha
If im honested Ive never wanted to play a kojima game except for boktai
They should do that boktai vs megaman battle network crossover again but with different franchises
Players will be able to connect Mega Man Battle Network to Death Stranding 2 for a one of a kind battle mode
i have no idea who that guy is
that is the most kojima thing that ever kojima'd
if i can't play as that guitar guy, what's the point
that looks 100x better then the 1st 1
need the universe where konami didn't fuck over kojima so we can keep getting mgs
just call it an interactive movie
So 20 hours of cutscenes and then you go around an empty wasteland on a bike again
damn he just killed it entirely with one sentence, that's crazy
so a Bedge type of game ok
I cannot be bothered to care about death stranding I'm sorry
Flashfrost is losing his mind right now
i cant wait for ff7 remake part 2
That was like 5 games with very long trailers that I didnt want to play
that "generations" in the yt search did so much lifting
ok i was thinking axl was trolling when he told me to look this up
If there's no GaySex in the remake what's the point
the website is shadow generrations lol
We live in an era where the Shadow the Hedgehog game is considered nostalgic and I think that's beautiful
i still remember playing that game randomly during the 2008 election
truly a time to be alive
i only remember it cuz of everyone staying up late that night KEKW
Shadow the Hedgehog has 326 possible routes each with unique names
And NONE Of them have a sonic x shadow love scene
maybe there's a secret 327 with it
@SeventyFourTG DO u think dark souls and skyrim stole off that?
hai bootiful glglgl with run(s) blobComfy
Most people don't know it because it's a show targeted towards babies but Sonic Prime definitely has generations of Sonic X Shadow
oh its actually a non-cursed thing
i wonder what a sonic and shadow fusion character would look like or their own kid.
Shadow better rmention that damn fourth chaos emerald
we got a proto and bass fsion with megaman alreasy come on sega give us what we want
and no one told me there was a silent hill 2 remake Trailer Madge
@blacktiger51 It featured entirely gun gameplay
Put the new one on twitter so we know how to reach you
Phantom do you still have the giant donkey kong plush
You should put him on the bed
with sonic also dropping on PS4 I wonder how long the PS4 will be supported. This holiday marks 4 years for PS5
would love it if they would just move on
imagine is switch is supported 4 years after the OG switch launches. That would be at least 11 years on the market
only thing i really mildly cared about was sonc
the only other thing i could've cared about is getting its own standalone thing next week lmao
mirby there is a write up on PS blog too
did you see what mike pollock said about it?
"You had me at Sonic X."
need to remember to get the FF7 double pack. You get remake and rebirth for 70 if you preorder digitally
can't believe we're getting Super Sonic 3D World + Shadow's Fury
yeah fair. i also really can't wait to hear the new remixes
i also disliked how they basically forced you to have to swap to hit certain foes
but the way they're focusing on party makeup and combo attacks and stuff makes me feel like that won't be as much of an issue in rebirth
plus really from leaving midgar up until temple of the ancients you don't really have any party members taken away. it happens a lot in midgar but after that
"go away barret go hang out with marlene or something until we need you maybe"
also hope th raiders are doing well
That is a fair assessment. And a true one at that
speaking of SPM, I got 4th in Defeat Shadoo last night :)
Honestly the Flopside Pit is really not worth it though. You have to complete all 100 trials TWICE in order to actually fight the boss and you know what you get for it? A few cards
Flipside Pit for Dashell is great. Flopside Pit is just annoying
i mean yeah, 0.9^4 is only 65%
oh boy, endgame rng! my favorite!
Oh no i meant the red essence not giving you a freebie
holy shit, I just watched the sonic x shadow generations trailer
knowing sonic team it's going to be mid but it LOOKS so GOOD
They got Ian Flynn on board for the new Shadow storyline so I'm mostly looking forward to that but they have messed up the Sonic game launches in some way consistently in recent years
I kind of lost faith after they made Superstars mid
Like at that point I was hoping maybe they could stick to their original formula and be fine. Origins was good enough
what's up gamers hope everyone is doing well (:
Maybe they can remaster their older 3D game style though. Here's hoping
I would love a Secret Rings remaster fwiw
Secret Rings with a better camera and no motion controls would be quite nice i think
They should do more remasters like what they did with Sonic Adventure 2 PS3/Xbox 360, just direct ports of Sonic Heroes and what not to modern platforms
I still don't know why they changed lives to a Tails rescue count
Sonic X Shadow Generations physical edition should come with a baby Shadow keychain
gl on the run Phantom pokemoGloom
yea i saw, i haven't checked the notes in a while though
yea i remember doing SR on mad adder once, it was so satisfying lol
I have a con to go to!
Gonna be Astarion from Baldur's Gate 3 tomorrow
I went to Buc-ee's for the first time
Yooo Phantom phanto274BLANKIES good luck phanto274Smile
But first day of con is tomorrow!
Gonna try and meet up with my friend tomorrow
She's going all four days too
All my costumes are hanging up
hey man, Do you know if 1.1 makes the game run faster?
Missing both Magfest and Agdq kicked me in the FOMO-ass haarrrd 💔
oh my all bosses is ass. I love running it, the only thing that objectively sucks is having to wait 10 minutes for the ending/credits to run through.
It’s been neat setting the standard.
I really think it can be done in sub 3:40 not exaggerating
ALSO… you’re not gonna like the 3rd chest
waiting for that damn plant to water
You can potentially waste 2 minutes for no reason not even kidding you
Same with formless but screen transitioning’s at least faster
Gassox in the remake actually. I was rejected for not fighting him and was confused lol
I thought there was a different formless or something LUL
I’m also considering if Lazy Shell is worth it or not during 3D Culex….
I kinda need peach to be the item gurl in that fight.
1) I need both bulk and status protection and 2) Item lock can be scary and you need to rez someone
I do use red essence on Mallow during it
yeah, it’s weird doing it at level 17
Mallow’s Snowy and Ultra Fireball is too useful during the fight lol
Star Rain’s not worth it. long afffff
Honestly it just feels good to set the standard for that category. I expect any vet of SMRPG to just bop me the second they have a mutual interest
so I’ve only done 2 runs of Normal RTA and apparently missed the part you buy whomp glove for Mallow.
I really need to get my sub 240 already in this game LUL
lot of RNG? takes me back to the Paper Mario days :’)
yeah. pray Geno just dodges her magic lmao
nahhh… kinda looked like mallow did more damage slightly from what I saw
it’s funny how ridiculous Super Suit mallow is 😂
It’s cool everyone’s still flexing their own route in this game
OH, This is breezy??? I was like Damn!!! LUL This nutcase doing a Super Suitless run 😂
I’ve never seen any breezy runs of the game.
Cool! 😄 I’ve been thinking of doing Breezy All bosses tbh too.
I still might get super suit for 3D Culex, it’s a lot of health. post bosses in general are the longest bosses in the game.
Quartz Charm Buff is also a godsend
I still need to go to RPGLimitBreak ;w;
I want to travel everywhere and like 10 cons but $$$$ 💔
3 = 4th. 4th = 2nd. It’s more confusing than it sounds
Shocker feels like a gamble if I perfect time it lol

At least it's evident in the recording you know how it's supposed to be done
ou'll get something good in that timeframe, trust me
Switch Pro D-pad is also just hot garbo
dang i missed it, nice run!
@kbzonfc1 def nice but unsubmitable due to massive errors
Yo I have a game to look forward to in autumn leggo
And ggs and hello and goodbye KEKW
@everyone strimmer asked you a question
My Laryngitis is going away and being able to talk rapidly
Still have a leftover cold but that's also going away hopefully by tomorrow
it bugs out a config file and resets it
gonna lurk. have a fun run
Never forget that LANS just used a old stock image of peach instead of recreating the picture
At least that's 4× the amount of vanilla
I thought it was baby sNeed logic
Do you know how the free fly location works? Like how do you know wherre its at?
gotcha, so it may have a chance of being somewherre you already been to
that check was bananas B A N A N A S. that check was bananas B A N A N A S. Cheer100
Or can you win a shield from crane game?
Heart containers and bunch o rupees
I think this is like the one problem with GBLA, is that you can't bind the sword and shield to it's own button
Y'know... Maybe that's the reason why it was cut in minish cap
goodness this seed is a jet and weird one
Unfortunately if you did use the ocarina it would take you out of the dungeon
Oh so the kill is priorized over the warp?
"Hope you feel miserable carrying around all those rupees!"
Honestly I miss that trend in Zelda games where there's a gremlin that thinks you'll hate having to do less or have more of an item
Lttp has the half magic meter goblin
Howdy gl on the shit show
Just out of curiosity, does the colo doc have the bayleef route notes?
1.7 to go for another ham submission
I almost read gooooin as gooning
I'm gonna make you get wr eventually
I have  170.5K that I really don't know what to spend on
It's always very monkaS when someone tells you I have (exceedingly high amount of channel points) and you have redemptions for the stream
I could spend it on 1 VIP to demote myself
It could probably count as a demotion
But it's up to phantom himself
(I know you're they/them but I just can't even know if themself is appropriate in there)
There was also a cracked wall
Oh right talon aka Mario uses the stick for the honeycomb
speaking of cracked that was a quick fight
so very cracked i'm guessing lol
As long as it's not Goombario
Leave Rover alone, they just want to play catch
At least you're doing good on HP
Oh sick, someone actually doing the Rando
Did you do the Monthly yet?
Still learning and already doing Hard Seeds? :P Nice though
You know about bomb triggers yet?
Bomb Triggers are huge. They Revolutionize D
But everything in their own time
Want an explanation of what it does and why or am I backseat-dumping?
Okay so you know the Legendary Bomb Arrows, right?
So basically if you place two bombs within a frame of each other, the game thinks you're trying to make a bomb error.
BUT because there is no arrow on screen, it skips to the next mechanic in the list. Which is Cutscene Triggers.
So if you place two bombs within a frame of each other you trigger a cutscene!
The problem is, you cant place two bombs at the same time, right? So what you're instead doing is being on the edge of a screen, placing a bomb, transitioning and buffering another bomb.
This allows the following: Yoshi Check without Yoshi, D7 Pillars Exploding, Tarin Cutscene without Powder, D8 Opening without Ocarina or Song, Windfish Egg Opening without Ocarina or Song.
Oh and Item Pickups at the one Pit-Heart Piece and in the Forest Connector Cave
If you wanna attempt it I can also guide you via text. But let me see if I can pull a video on it.
Can I post a video link or is that filtered?
This twitch user also has a video series showing every single hard, glitched and hell logic trick in the entire game.
minus 3 things that have been discovered since then. Like, for example, you can beat D6 without L-2- Bracelet now
Because you can actually bomb trigger the destruction of the Elephant Statues!
And I dont know if you're on the Discord yet but I can highly recommend it. Daid (creator of LADXR) makes monthly seeds that feature some sort of new additions. 2 months ago he added Enemizer for example!
Oh, you can also bomb trigger the Fisher witout the fishing hook which is fun
You can also get that item through the wall with bomb triggers
And Feed Papahl (but only if you have the vittles)
Bow isnt required, only locks a single check
But what if the Seashell Reward is Face Key! Kappa
Oh since you're an LAS player. Do you know the pecuilarities of the Seadshell Rewards?
If you enter the Mansion with EXACTLY either 5 or 10 Seashells, you get a Freebie Shell
This is not in logic but it gets you there faster
These 2 shells are also permanently missable, even in vanilla
I'mma be big chillin once I get to the crib
btw magpie also has auto tracking if youre interested
Still astounds me that Daid's Randomizer runs on OG hardware.
If you set it right on Magpie and check the "Unique-Items" menu it will show you how many Non-MCB Items are in the dungeon
So like if those 3 checks left are the M C and B it shows "0 Items left"
Any interest in Mina the Hollower?
Ah it's called "Show Major Dungeon Item count"
And then under dungeon items set to "Map/Compass/beak". And the chest next to each Dungeon shows how many checks are left in that dungeon that arent just MCB
I love magpie. Would marry it.
If you wanna try a bomb trigger here... Kappa
The game knows you want to bomb trigger
Broom Broom Broom Broom. I want you in my room.
Leave this room before you save and quit
Because if you save and quit in the same room, it doesnt actually save it breaking.
You could say this function in the game...
The odds in the vanilla game of the right side up are - I believe - 50/50
For LADXR, Daid upped the chances to 75% right side.
more like a 75% its gonna failed
I do feel like Small Keys are dungeon local
Oh I thought you said only MCB are local
Or did you mean MCB are non local
I got it other way around
Idk if it's also in LAS but did you know that Goombas always drop a heart if you jump on them
Do the bushes in LAS above the well also guarantee heart drops?
1 SMK + 1NMK for Facade
If you use them correctly of course
I dont know if that's in logic
Crazyyyy. It's considered in logic. The superjump i mean
Youre not clipped in most of the time
and with way I mean like couple pixels
Yeah I think the line up is with the 2nd row of water effects
How many items do you even need?
Like do you have the NMK?
You could also just... super jump to the pot chest.
This way you can't get the chest on the right though
if you use a key here while not having Max keys you might actually hard lock yourself fun fact
fun fact, you know the Raft Chest key?
So it can never be a small key if they are dungeon local
Oh here's a fast kill for Facade
You can place bombs before he shows up
so you can get 3 hits in before his first text bos appears if you place it near the lower side of him
nope just as soon as your previous bomb explodes, place next one
you can also count to 3 right when his face fully disappear and place the bomb
If you wanna try it: Line up with the Screen Transition to the actual egg by jumping agsainst the border with a Feather.
Then pull up the item menu. Have Bombs equipped. AS you exit the item menu, HOLD Bomb Button and Up
The feather doesnt let you transition
use the feather to align yourself with the edge
Aaaand that pretty much is it. You can kill all pillars with this bad boy.
Lineups also work with Pegasus Boots or by manually edging yourself to it
for left / right transitions you need to hold left / right and up
You can also buffer an Item Menu through the screen transition and then buffer bombs again through the item screen buffer for some of the harder ones (Pillar 1 & 2)
Pillar 4 is so easy to bomb trigger it falls over if you look at it the wrong way!
Deth I? I thought his name was DethL
Why is this Kansas but this is not Arkansas??
The worst someone saw was 12.
So we're tracking for Hall of Fame Purposes.
oh another fun fact, you remember the gohma mini boss?
yeah if you play song 1 or 3 or ocarina with no songs to them, they open their eyes.
You can also skip that fight entirely with Hookshot
If you do 0 Deaths there's a secret Prize in LADXR :pss:
Make sure to check out the Monthlies on the Discord
i do like watching this more then tmc rando
just wait till you get to Shaq Jumps
So essentially you Pegasus boot feather jump near a wall then pause menu before you hit the wall then you equip sword and item menu buffer the opposite direction and the sword at the same time.
And you do a jump in the other direction. That way you can stand on pegs and open chests like in D3 and D7
Dont get me started on JESUS JUMPS
I dont think youre ready to hear about Shonen Jump yet.
Jesus Jumps let you be like Jesus if Jesus was in the NBA.
That's why Shaq Jumps and jesus Jumps are best friends.
running against a good early game sucks
your PB is still the first one on the route change right?
its gone from my mind already
so I assume sub-2:40 is reasonable, then
I mean, that's what they say.
We're up all night to get lucky
ah right it came out literally as I graduated college...
I hadn't considered how much of an impact chain was gonna have on the speedrun vs the SNES version...
komari1Think so do all runs accomplish Mack Skip because he's not called Mack anymore?
welp time to leave then >:(
K see ya in two and a half hours
Omg two text boxes that changes everything PogChamp
You know now I get why some runners hate me KEKW
yeah, I'd guess Rose Town then also does some filter/effect which is unhappy when midas leaves things in a bad state
ohhhh right, which is when they queue the slowdown on the music
How many people hit this cutscene multiple times without restarting the game, after all?
doing pretty good, how are you?
come on dominos, get it together phanto274Facepalm
i am! im just lurkin car shopping online currently spinofdog
idk why my keyboard does this sometimes, the numbers just straight up randomly dont work and it only fixes when i restart my pc
i think it needs driver updates tbf but im just so lazy
im so frickin stressed tho because i need a new car for my current job and this new job. My vehicle battery just randomly dies and also needs three thousand dollars in repairs on the engine because it needs a new timing chain NiceSoftlock
it died mid shift on thursday and i was CRYING because i didnt know what to do and no one was answering me
thankfully my friend knew a guy in the town i was in lmfao Gladge
i negotiated a price on a car tonight that a family friend looked at/tested for me but the dealer basically wanted a deposit in order to take the ad down and keep it til next saturday
so i was like um. Im not putting a deposit down because i dont have that money rn and i also havent even seen the car myself
so i was like well, ill check in with you on wednesday
yeah well my current job is home care, so i literally am using my car to drive to clients homes
my new job is fourty-five minutes away but will also require occasional travel to towns around that area
im tryna also get a place in that town but theres like nothing to rent
okay this number thing is annoying me brb pc restart OMEGALUL
I found this amazing Miku figure
I can totally see someone crushing on Johnny from this game lol
"Don't be intimidated Mario, just try to imagine him in 3D. OH NO HE'S HOOOOT"
I'd definitely recommend this as someone's first RPG
But has basics like HP and magic
Isn't too long and the plot ain't complicated
The remake is obviously even better
So if someone wants to get into specifically JRPGs, this game would be my pick
I would say Pokémon too, but that's kinda different from other JRPGs mechanics wise
RPG has the more straightforward layout
Darn the shark bested us this time
Persona 5 Royal is too complicated to suggest for someones first RPG
I love it, but it definitely isn't for everyone
But Super Mario RPG is both simple to understand and really fun to master
persona 5 to me has to many group conversations for me to enjoy.
Once you rly understand the mechanics
I say as someone who's only beaten 2 superbosses
I know WHAT to do, I just gotta DO it
Peach is amazing, just not in a speedrun
Getting p much a full HP recovery with a proper action command
My main complaint with this game is the platforming
But the RPG parts are so good that they balance out
But yeah the platforming is p jank
I do like the way they use Stars in this game tho
The camera angle does not make it any better
@Ohrocks no Thanks for the gift sub!
What does bot mean by this
Shout-outs to Twitch doing stupid for the 1,000th time in a row
Like, when has Twitch done anything cool in the past 5 years without it going wrong?
I'll probably chip in 15$ when I have time and not working
Yo I just got 4 new static emotes back today 👀
I have like 10 animated slots too
idk wtf to do with them
these are the new ones that came back today
I'm pretty basic lmao you're guesses are probably correct lmao
Lost, NoU, Smiel, & Zombie lol
Okay, Rainbow Candy is a winner
Yeah I was gonna say nimbus castle
do you consider dodo to be mostly cutscene?
yea thi game needs this a lot lol
oh did you beat my fortune pb? lol
yea just gotta have in mind that you do half dmg when Johnny is red
lol true, boomer is a fight on a different game
YEP 12 am been going to bed early due too being fucking cold in my room
feel like i am in a freezer
we don't do heat in this house not cold enough for it
I see beating that Piranha went just as plant!
If you think that's good, I've got a pun more!
canonically the widest character in the game teejay46Cloudface
Why do those things look like mallow
Btw, I picked up that Slow Go badge at like 20 minutes
Took me 3 hours to beat that seed
I told chat, next I'll do an Iron Boots only Zootr, but it's more expensive
Didn't you do BN6 with Quiz King?
They actually talked about picking up Super Slap btw
They were trying to make peach relevant LUL
she had her time in SNES
Her joining my party is too much
Shocker is like 26 frames later to time
Finale to this mighty salty run back
If the implication of this area is that Smithy is massproduced, who manufactures him?

Nah rain is goated, especially when inside
Rain is good cause I don't have to water my outdoor plants
If it's raining inside you should probably get that checked out Kappa

I got 1 at home lolol

Whats weird is I bought the special research and it just wont show up
I spent 1 whole dollar on that research
See if he has a dollar, he could've used it to prevent timeout
All the good items up front lol
You neglected to pick up Hammer Throw, didn't you?
Who dropped their cake in there
Pokémon chatters are the worst I swear, bros just said gouging fire is trash KEKW
And just because only one had it, got to finals, and of course, dunked on by urshifu as always
ello! how is the race going?
They need to make lime flavored
Omg why they just explode him now?
My gourmet guy goes into the details about why it was good
then they run around and take off
adam was fighting heart when u was fighting jr
oh yeah i didn't look at the tracker whoops
Don't forget to do a pit run Madge
i got to pirates fortress in mm and gave up because i kept getting caught, definitely should have practiced a bit more (like at all) before jumpiong back into MM but it was fun, and i played better than i expected to up til that point
my brother got invited to a combine for the professional soccer team in vegas

hes gotta be good enough to get signed tho
phantom I'm DNFing where was the last fortress key
ngl i was gone for a hour so idk
i left and come back and you was in go mode
I believe Russ T had a Fortress KEy
it was a block just before tubba castle
Darn missed the ending what was ur placement?
did you get free pizza cuz  of it?
Costco jacked up my order… I ordered a hotdog (with drink) and chicken bake and I got 2 hotdogs and 1 drink…
Nsingman finished about a minute ago
i had pizza hut burn my 2 pizza and they send me the whole order again even the pop and beard sticks and they was like do whatever u want with the 2 pizza
it was fine as leftover so hey didn't taste like burn pizza
Hello flu boy here reminding everyone that the flu sucks
I’ve been feeling like death since last night and now I finally stopped dying
constantly reminding myself to hydrate is what stopped it
anyway chilling and probably gonna sleep as I lurk phanto274GL
"out of logic but I'm gonna do it anyway"
I am existing and enjoying the world's atmosphere :)
Also weather has been nuts the past few days, apparently there's a tornado warning in California???
i miss it where was bombette
what does the 315 next to Paper Mario randomizer (N64) mean?
what’s next to the record on the tracker?
i think the thai place messed up my order
and made it hotter than i wanted
fuck I forget the emote LOL
I just woke up from a god tier nap
we're considering throwing a freezer in my living space (basement)
I admit, the idea of ice cold vodka and ice bars in the luxury of my room is VERY tempting
in addition to, y'know, having a freezer for storing food
Nah a freezer of just alch is all a person needs
white onions is good on pizza
dominos making me look bad for repping their company phanto274Rage
they did that to me at gdq except with anchovies and olives.. I ordered pepperoni phanto274Smile
my friend would always get bacon mushrooms and white onions on pizza its was good
pizza sounds so good right now
I had a fat steak earlier tho
can i have some steak too? phanto274ColonD
I love steak like it’s no one’s business
i had roast pork for dinner pretty sure we have leftovers
I've converted too many people onto spinach tomatoes and garlic (onions and peppers optional)
HOLD up spinach is good on pizza but only on pizza
9 times out of 10 i just get a pep pizza
my older brother does chicken spinach tomatoes (garlic optional)
the only tomato I do is ketchup
I eat that shit by the gallon
I'm not crazy about Meat Lover's
i actually hate anything tomatoes beside pizza sauce
i don’t eat them either hahha
I used to hate veggies, but eating bitter stuff made me develop a taste for them
I have to use a special supplement bc I have the palette of a small child
Glitchless and I died to the lava bubble in volcano LUL
i only like cauliflower broccoli and carrots
i would eat mushrooms on a pizza but only on a pizza
they’re sweeter as the name implies and has a lot of natural flavor
Also, in rando I skipped the left tree on the beach which had storeroom key NotLikeThis
grandpa throws brown sugar in his chili
Laki -> 3rd tubba key in winding path
its starting to get cold af in my room
i only have shorts on rn
I did an escape room the other day and I solved a puzzle all on my own monadoC but we didn’t escape in the end monadoHands
We were two solves away from escaping
i want to go to the mall there
dreaded was talking about an airbnb
but staying on property is sooooo clutch tho
am i gonna have to pay an arm and leg for parking again
it was 35 bucks a night to park
i might get a suite with a kitchen tbh
i have a hilton card, i can book seperately and save tons of money
I'd like to cook mire, but I'm usually away from home
he says, as he has a piece of chicken marinating in the fridge
Phantom, you can't just Shooting Star all your problems
I cook any and all soul food
vegetable oil w/ jerk seasoning and chili powder
put some respect on greens, that a [EXPLETIVE]-folk classic right there
I do my ancestors bad when I don’t cook em
when I was a child, I threw some greens in my backpack during dinner cuz I didn't want to eat them
you'd think after every holiday ive lived i would have eaten greens by now
it STINKS when its being cooked
it doesnt come near my plate for that reason
i was the person who walked off with a giant plate of meat
I'm convinced we're not eating / talking about the same greens
my mum's greens don't smell nor taste like ass, is my point
i bet mines dont either but i refuse to try them NiceSoftlock
slide 'em over, I'll test 'em myslef
Greens aren't THE priority, but I won't turn 'em down
then again, you can't eat everyone's cookin'
regular mac but even macaroni salid
i dont eat anything but chicken tenders while im out so im pretty sure my opinion isnt a strong one
we getting biscuits with our order, or we ain't getin' popeyes
Watt should get an attack buff when hit with thunder / electricity
they dont have chicken tenders FeelsBadgeMan
I ‘ve been going to one often enough to the point staff recognizes me and knows my order monadoKEK
they got chicken pot pie soup tho, which has quickly become one of my food addictions
okay this is gonna sound really childish
but i dont like soup/sandwiches bc it means different food groups are touching
dipping the sammich into the soup is SO damn tasty
i hate that im this sensory with food
it depends on the food, imo
what about dipping fries into a wendy frosty
my job sells ramen cups for less than a dollar and we have hella spices in the break room, so I've been fiending
tho I'd like some ACTUAL ramen
hating stuff that's too salty is just correct
damn that cutscene is still slow phanto274Smile
heya fam. congrats again on todays race! phanto274Jam
welcome into a 3rd yes 3rd rando
we were yeah, rigby finished around 6 hours. I was more concerned with learning checks so after 8 hours I finished all 8 gyms and called quits
you just reenter, I did all the cheeecks there
It's on the game description page, isn't it?
It's the first item in the list of "what other changes are made to the game"
also our abandoned ship was double dip. After dive you go for heat badge and strength, then go back later for key 1 for rain badge. Also feather badge was on victory road
Point being: don't say something isn't documented if it's in the most obvious documentation
I would prob review the one place I think it be at first
everdrive has a clock? so like berries will work?
Imagine jumping blindly into a rando without reading the FAQ
And why doesn't web generation work for you?
i dont like the website either
I made a seed on the web site once but have no idea how I did it. Locally actually makes sense
I guess it's a bit of a different flow if you're playing solo on console
also when you make an emerald seed does it automatically open in bizhawk for you too?
I've never used Archipelago for a solo rando bc that's not what it's primarily intended for
i think it also have red and blue item rando on there
ive been asking for an emerald key item rando for awhile so ill take what I can get
my longshot was looked in someone red and he was working so i cheated
what kinda stuff does it add?
oh you did an emerald rando yesterday
good thing combo rando wont be on archipelago
i wouldn't mind it so much but bizhawk is shit
my pc is ass so every time I try to record something on dolphin I get at least one or two instances of everything crashing
when it does work, it is... unstable
sup dawg hope rando has been fun
i tried using bizhawk for super mario world when i was like 12... it was miserable
should of use snes9x for that
i didn't know it existed at the time
i just went with bizhawk because i'd always watch nathanisbored's let's glitch super mario world vids and I wanted to do that stuff
that dream did not last so long
i use to play rom hacks of smw as a kid i always use zsnes for the rewinds
you could try VBA RR KEKW
oh boy 74 whole points left
what happens at 1000 hours of pape rando?
at 1000 hours this axl person get un vip Kappa
i mean im sitting at 90K, i could just redeem it again
9k more points then i will be at half a mil
i have 700k in jcogs LOL
I had 300k in coneys chat at the start of tonight but then he did saltybet kazamsCatglub
i've got 242k that im just chillin' on in here right now
its g r e a t
even if i dont talk too much, i like hanging out here phanto274Smile
I almost cried and had a heart attack and screamed and hollered when i heard that sound effect
I am doing homework so it brought me great despair
But you were just having yourself a nice little nap !
the one thing from wendy's i care about is the baconator but it's so expensive that I might as well just get a burger somewhere else
everything else is like, i'll eat it if someone buys it for me
i really like the cheesy cheddar burgers
i haven't been to jack in like 15 years
i loved their crispy chicken Caesar wrap and im still sad its gone
i considered getting some when they dropped the snoop dogg meal, whatever it's called, but like... that was so expensive for what you got
i hear they used to have some insane deals but y'know... nothing gold can stay :)
mcdonald's is absolutely worth it when you have the app and you know what ur doing
the food is so good tho Sadge
i've gotten some crazy deals from mcd's in the past
lmao yeah. mcd's is food and not much else
mcdonalds app has $650 combo meal, double bacon P w/ cheese. only time i ever eat there
i just got 10 pc nugget lg fires and a ice coffee  so good
hot take, but burger king has some good deals
if you live in the united states, burger king is never worth it
i like to think i have an iron stomach and that shit fucks me up every time
stomachaches for days and it tastes like ass
the last time I had Burger King, it reminded me WHY I don't eat Burger King anymore
even in canada burger king is mid
they have a pretty good chicken sammie
@blacktiger51 that's just it, it's MID
BK in the US is outright BAD
Sour Watermelon Rouge Energy, my BELOVED
Bk does have a decent milkshake
what up phantom, i watch your youtube videos all the time thanks for the content
ya seems like its been pretty rough
wait when did you find bow
regrettably, i stand by taco bell even if their prices get incrementally worse and the food quality doesn't get better
it's pretty good, but like, it's gotten way more expensive since 2019
......... that was 5 years ago!
and the beefy 5 layer is getting up there
you can get all those things in the cravings box though
and the cravings box has pretty good value in most places. some franchises will screw you over on the pricing though
all this food talk is making me hungy
hmmm, not the build your own cravings box
no yeah that's why I just... don't get other boxes. they're usually badly priced too
THANK YOU. breadcrumbs on mac n cheese are so bad
i said i wasnt gonna eat tonight and now i really want mac
i use to be able to get a box thing for 5 bucks that come with 2 tacos kfc fries and a apple pie then you could add extra tacos for 1 buck so i add 2 and get a drink for under 10 bucks now its like 16 bucks for all that like wtf
where is this go mode item
my Bedge is calling me but we so close to being done
i mean there' sno man doll
surely it cannot take much longer 4Head
i gtg but i hope you find what you're looking for
no details obvs, but interesting to see how two ppl go about the same seed differently
i have the attention span of a turtle
hell yeah we were playing bug fables
i had a seed the other night where i was bottlenecked by ultrahammer because i forgot the block in the spiny room was a superblock LUL
yeah little stuff like thats gets me all the time
i also screwed myself another seed because i forgot where the renewable cake-mix was
i really should have a notepad open when i play rando LUL
im definetly gonna need one when i try the DK64 rando soon LUL
are there boss shuffle randos where final bowser moves locations?
just shuffle the whole ass room
was just thinking abt going to final bowser and getting tutankoopa
if you do that you gotta include gooba king asachiTotalSmug
like cmon we need to have goomba king do something in rando more KEKW
i am about to raid my Bedge that where i am going
I'm here for the resets to bad quils or espy
We don't need it but up to you
As long as you know it's runnable
all 6 party members i care
If I can't see every party member's friendship rising I'll riot
also marcoGL beestGLGLGL majinGlad brugglGold marcoGL_HF
For anyone who doesn't know this is mandatory for the program to get your rng seed
it's useful to have stats up but only if chat actually knows enough to know if quilava will outspeed or something
I remember when I didn't have the rng burn and I had to roll like 110 times swifFlop
if you get it first try I will pog out of my mind dude
If this is first try the game hates me
What's minimum IV's to run Espeon?
Sounds like the perfect beginning to a speedrun YEP
Hp as in hidden power not health
fair, wasn't sure what the min SpA and Spd were
The main main thing is to get a good quil more than espeon
Fair, which there is no manip for YEP
This is to advance rng KEKW it's not go time
Forfeiting to a Bug/Grass trainer with Ho-oh and Charizard in the lead, seems like the only reasonable play YEP
Wait 2 frames of good ones?
Use him to heal your other mons phanto274Smile
yo phantom i was excited to see you announce you were doing runs of this. one of my favorite games as a kid :D
At least your reset music is great KEKW
At least it's the quicker of the 2
god i used to watch this forever ago and there was no manip for this so people would just sometimes reset for 4 hours and not get a runnable espeon KEKW
yeah he was DMing me about it cause I asked him to look into another game but he was busy with this
I'm more thinking as to how the fuck did they find this KEKW
Damn this game is so good
wdym HP Bug isn't going to get it done
You're telling me the physical low base power move on the special attacking pokemon wouldn't do it Clueless
Although I don't know if I've seen enough of a run to know who attacks the most
These are wild that they even exist
are we gonna be a based typhlosion chad or a cringagatr
assuming you did your cheating manips right
johnstone is just doing a living dex run of this game rn
bro is catching the delibird rn
bro isn't even doing the master ball dupe
bro his whole team gets roasted by charizard
seedot looks like an acorn it would not be a tasty snack
it would be a bitter nasty little tengu seed
Everyone in Orre is on the juice right
how TF Gonzap lookin' like that
did you get the right umbreon?
we gonna see some sick bite damage?
Real umbreon gamers teach their umbreon toxic
DID YOU KNOW GAMING UMBREON WA SSUPPOSED TO BE POISON TYPE
BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO RUIN THE TYPE CHART?
THIS WAS THE ONLY POKEMON GAME THEY LET YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
THAT DUDES ON THE JUICE FR
i was on caps lock wtf
Es Cade aint on the juice he's on something worse
you need to combine the mcdonalds with the juice to get the gains
Chat are these glitches for real?
you get the juice for ur typhlosion
They dont need balls that much in Arizona
you have to set out cheese for bait to capture a sandshrew out there
you dont need balls because they're on the juice
Fun trivia fact Lotad was drawn by a child in a magazine contest
omg ur running the best pokemon gams ever blkkatGasper
yo why is your makuhita incel type?
Dude they need to bring back shadow lugia alueivDance
Do you catch any shadows in any %?
omg catching the legendaries was a pain in this blkkatKEKW
I remember the first time I played this game, as a child, I didn't try to capture any pokemon until the Miror B. fight
let's see if we get a good quilava
cheating? welp i'm out cya it was fun
this games graphic studio and soundtrack team went all in for this game so good blkkatGasper
yo u can catch in ground wild blkkatChinchillLurk
let's see if we got a real one
dude if it was shiny would be crazy lol
was a good run umbreon thats my fav mon yewfGato
The split has him named Santa clause
As a kid I would have NEVER expected him to be the TRUE final boss
that's quite a few drinks on the table
liquid was a cool twist alueivDance
wes the most fly portag lol
Barboach looks like a fun arts and crafts project with just a balloon and a water bottle.
dude i love this music so hypw
bagon would make some tasty fried chikcne
I'm stuck in an ad and dont get to see the streamer reaction
Bagon maybe a little gamey though?
even chickens can be gamey if you're eating an old rooster and not one of those genetic freak crime against nature broilers
I did my first run with typhlosion i believe and then tried again with meganium was fun
I think I reset after realizing I missed so many good pokemon as a kid, don't remember for sure though.
i liked using meganium cuz they can tank earthquake and do it back lol
voltorb is already cringing they didn't see the need to make it a shadow type
The music in this game and XD is so good
that doduo is doin' a little PogChamp
Swablu has sick nasty special defense that's why the cloudy feathers are for
i'm reporting the stream for gratuitous violence
look how you hurt that spheal
it's a radish.... but it's kinda odd.....
it's a shrew.... but the back is coated in sand.....
if you dont take out that snadshrew right now it will decimate ur team
one of these is the Mantine, right?
they needed the lowbie remoraid to evolve the manytke
why they make the luvdisc that sad
how could you do it to them
just throw a pokeball at it
oh snap ya catching that ? thats a good mon
@needaname37 yea i know this the whole team
mantine was on my team back in day just saying lo
Lost you time out of spite
back in the day it was espeon typhlosion all 3 dogs and tyranitar
i'm not logging in till after la mulana tonight
so if someone finds me titans mitts, i can get your heat emblem
girl is in full cosplay guarding the secret gang's cave
would bagon do well free ranging in a coop and run?
bro another ad when i ask about bagon
Why meditite again? is it for held item?
oh it’s twisted spoon isn’t it
meditite makes a journey once in its life to mt. coronoet in the sinnoh region
Look at that lovey spoon for your Espeon 🥄
you have a good sosh dude?
Rider sosh? I barely know her tho
mareep is a good pokemon to keep you get milk, tallow, and wool for compost
and in this game surviving is a must lol
need the CAD files to injection mold my own Beldum
dudes prob gonna spam rain lol
Hot take I think the XD theme is better even though I still like this one
that wasn't digging a hole that was phasing through it like this was skyrim
good ole Pokémon Stadium ass move animation
i still vastly prefer his XD theme but the Colosseum one's still a bop
if this was 2016 internet we would all post "cringe"
that's 7 more fights than i've ever used a plusle in
duking doesnt need a plusle to defend himself after he found a dealer for his research chems
nobody in Agate village is juiced though since the old heads know that shit will kill ya
this is the pokemon area where you find an old woman whose boyfriend is a mightyena
do not post to pokemon's official twitter account
I need to go shopping but gl with the rng fest Phantom phanto274Bless
you laugh but a hp fire off blaze would be fckn sick
wasnt there a youtube video where they showed the pikachu winning this fight?
ur shadow rush is physical rn?
damn that quilava got a BOOTY
in pokemon legends celebi we will visit the agate forest
time to replace with entei then
popping in to drop this ooc quote
I realize there's some overlap between" furry"and "monster fucker"
bro i go afk, come back, and suddenly we got the big BADGER
we're at the point in the game where we're fighting gravelers, not geodudes
outrageous that they thought a 100 battle challenge was okay
"it doesnt matter now" suddenly 2 hours over WR
my wii almost roasted itself and I saw some cool artisanal, wild caught corruptions from it.
the fan was dusty from not being turned on in 2/3 years
This game sucks there's no agumon
I need his big ass head to be present
both wii media players struggle to run standard off the shelf x265 files
I have to re-encode to watch my cartoons on an authentic CRT
I like shoving random things in my soda cans once im done with themto add impurities to the recycler's mix
bro fucking owned u ur destroyed kid
just takes while to head back
look at that monster on platform 10
Anyone else get a pump before battling pokemon gym leaders with your legendaries?
rated E10 for mild cartoon violence
did u know u can connect dualshock 4 playstation controllers to the nintendo wii and play gamecube games with it
are you playing pokemon colosseum on a dualshock 4 rn?
I had this game on gamecube! Loved it didn't know you'd run it
just got another ad, enjoy your 3 cents from this phantom
when you accidently rematch him again he will have a level 60 burned guts swellow
then it will be over 4 u
that is japanese signage.... so cyberpunk.....
EIN is only on research chems
YOU SOLD TOXIC? UMBREON COULDA USED THAT
they were so loyal to the source material.... except for shadow pokemon being cringe....
bro now curtissimo comes live with kirby 64 what have you done phantom it's spreading.
I followed him when he was playing that new F zero
3 rare candies in a box was the most PogChamp moment of this game
is that steelix was shadow you could Stealix it
bro that cell phone crusher guy just cracked an apple vision pro into pieces
at least the glass is laminated so it wont cut up your face if you do that accidently
bro it broke just from the scratch test
this thing is flimsy as eff
why is thtat jigglypuff not shadow
ive seen waht it can do in melee
imagine being an evil shadow stantler and eventually growing as a person until ur a wyrdeer
it would mess up the pathing
you could bake that pile of swine for its lard
let me guess who the murderer was
imagine calling your evil train the SHADOW LINER
not doing the under colosseum for a SICK togetic?
or u just gonna steal that dudes?
wild that he gives you a worse elekid if u evolve it
shadow aipom? aren't all monkeys just like that regularly?
Yes I am back great outing and munching. How is the route?
oh so u decided no stats
Will you run gale of darkness?
a different sort of question but did u ever try the hello kitty form of tetris?
it is such an interesting concept and i like the penalty system.
So what happens if you get a shiny in a run
You dont catch any shadow pokemon?
Oh yeah you get qualava as a shadow I fogot
Espeon is so op in this game
I transferred between this game and emerald 🤣 via gba
It was cool to see kyogre in the mainstage fights 🤣
Anyway to get back in blaze?
meditite is getting purified a lot this run
dw u cant accidentally give umbreon earthquake.
Why he need to be dead?
Does it help to decide what they send first?
bro that porygon's model is fucked up
The milk has gone bad Sadge
put it out of its misery
Typhlosion getting flamethrower so late before HG/SS is a travesty
unless I missed an X Defend lmao
I finished my first emerald seed!!
At least they're focusing the weak side Prayge
I forgot about the shadow metagross
That would make more sense to swap Typhlosion in maybe? Hmm
You did use x special on makuhita and then didn't attack with espeon?
Emerald Seed I did. Ill send you the patch and yaml settings later.
did it die somewhere it wouldn’t have got attack EV’s?
Or maybe Houndoom rolling a plus def nature
Yeah I’m not pulling the calc out I’m just surprised it lived since Houndoom’s bull is poor
It must assume makuhita dies cause it’s an instant kill
that’s the last boss too Clueless
3 fire blast hits EZ Clap
always threw me he could fly KEKW
thank you no sandstorm SpDef boost
Oh nice we get Ho Oh as part of the timing
Oh god that probably wasn't a drone copter KEKW
I never considered that before Aware

I am looking forward to it FeelsGoodMan
I think I already praised this games ost today
which is good because you spend so much time battling
o think she lost all cards but I missed how
I didn't know that the pokeballs didn't get used I sweating at first
why is first on cooldown I wanna be FIRST
I'm unfamiliar with what you're doing. Are you just fishing for a good team comp?
yo this rich boy got a cacnea
and that doesn't count against time?
you go through all of that and THEN you have to hit a frame-perfect input? yikes.
wait it'll even tell you how many frames you were off? Wow.
that girl on the title screen had some bug eyes monkaS
Oh don't need much at all
oh right HP has variable BP as well in this gen
right, I figured that. Do they not increment once per frame?
because if it's 435 increments you need, this seems like it would chew through that real fast
my man has two Zigzagoons and decided to not evolve either of them?
no Willie, you don't need seasoning, you need to evolve.
they just dropped that body bag like it was a pack of pillows
wait, gen3 was still certain types are special/physical?
didn't play gen3 as a kid
and ghost is for some stupid reason physical
just allowing your fast gengar to set up for your slow special attacking partner to hit harder 10% of the time
Well the only ghost move in gen 1 was what lick
It makes sense for it to be phys
dude looks like human mr krabs
they’re the guys we terrorized with explosives and mugged
so are we catching the shadow Pokémon or are we just catching the starter and sweeping
have you ever done a randomizer of this game
for the first time ever I had to go without gas ⛽️ for a day. it was sleepless and chilly 🥶
it is now we are up 🆙 and running 🏃‍♂️
how bad is the manip for this game, i remember being told its not fun
wait you can snag when they dig?
yeah 👍 pokeball dimension phases all elements
i'd be down to learn for sure tho, this game has been on my list to learn for a while. but i just committed myself to routing magic pengel since from what i've found it could be a sub 4 hour run
its a 8-15 hour game casually
and it has no src page so its a free WR technically WICKED
be right back my dinner showed up
the names are hilariously bad in this game even compared to other Pokemon games
i want another colo pokemon game
Yeah those names are questionable lol
there’s a joke I could make with that name but I’m gonna keep my mouth shut
this and xd were the only time i cared about story in a pokemon game
even legends couldnt keep me interested in the story past the time travel bit
I found a shiny hippowdon in my file of Pokémon arceus and I wasn’t even looking for it
i found too many shiny pokemon in arceus
all my shinies in scarlet and violet are from wonder trades
i mean i like that they seem to have increased the chances of finding them, but it also kind of ruins finding them
why can’t this remoraid be the shadow one
that’s a real cool oldish attack animation
you both jump off the roof to battle here
u cant do the full heal target glitch nooooooo
pretty sure the strongest Pokémon we’ve fought was that mantine and that cool oddish, everything else is pathetic
espeons attack fell whyd u use return
he has a b*dass twisted spoon meditite
They really got away with that "Shoot!"
the ESRB rating is just E, not E10
what is that guys catch rate
the best Pokémon ever dunsparce and my favourite
At least you can evolve him now
I mean he technically did get better
time for the best fight in the game
why steal plusle of all things
hey it’s the magic happy place
if I remember that kirlia is one level away
is it possible for pikachu to win
Yooo Phantom phanto274BLANKIES good luck! How have things been today? phanto274Smile
Very nice! I just woke up from a nap and one of your vods was on, and i was like damn phantoms live iceblueGoMode
now quilava isn’t evil he’s just joined the terrorist group
We need the experience and the attacks to land
plusle is still in our team
The music in this game is so good phanto274Jam
shall we dance on these 10 floors
no lie he should have been a machamp 2 armer.
mans just slapped him silly monadoBonk
Also dang the RNG manip must have gone well gl gl!
killing entei instead of capturing hurts me a lil
Look away for Suicune and Raikou too Stavros phanto274Cry
at least they were dumb with attract
no way this game has a manip too NotLikeThis also yo gl
Sneasel needs Fire Blast? That's surprising to me
I was gonna say it must be close
I hate when I blow up a room, creating a giant impassable fissure that my enemies can't cross only to leave them a key to get in another way
oh right I forgot about this tech
Just in time to see you beat Skrub. Kappa LUL
Is Ein the most normal name in this entire game? LUL
Still good time save and if end goes well there's a big time save there too
But I like to wait for multiple minutes to ferry only 5 people through a door at a time
U forget gonzap split again lol
Oh nice I made it in time for the fun fight
People can say what they want about this game, but the AI is SMART
my fave shadow pokemon and my fave gold star owned card
There was a couple extra fights too
Have a good night, thanks for stream phanto274Smile
bye all perfexct strim as always
hi, so I didn't watch your first runs, but I have to ask: how is the manip?
it's mostly a manip I find insane from a technical standpoint cause it's on gc which is rare because most gc/wii games seeds correctly which this one does, but the manip is a seed recovery
gonna train myself to get 9990 in snow whirled during this
took I think like 3 months total of dev or something?
I wish I could remake the program in avalonia....but bug fables takes all my times :(
Qt's toolkit is....it works, but tbh it's harder to get it right
yeah high dpi is a problem
avalonia and C# are much nicer to maintain and don't have these problems as much
ik you can do high dpi stuff with Qt, but I just never learned how
Last night I curious, so I did an off stream emerald seed without using the map tracker and I actually finished. I was mad I didnt local record it LUL
one thing with this manip that's kind of weird: frequently, you'll get a cluster of 3/4 in a row to be a good seed and you hit the 1/4 bad one
at the meterroite I ran into a wonder guard and had to chip damage with sand stream
the program hides that umbreon is generated first so the espeon can get overap with similar rolls cause they align
I sent you some stuff to help with emerald too
one dog pokemon to watch his ride, and another by his side helping him steal shit
xd's manip is the same, but you enter 2 numbers and it's 2-4 passes only
I heard that colossuem was made difficult to combat rentals companies.
Is this all to setup the manip?
Throw the whole speedgame in the trash
The worst thing I've ever heard
I'd rather speedrun Z1 for a sub 28
I saw someone manip all shiny captures on this game on yt. Took them forever 🤣
Finally get to umm rider willy 🤣
team rocket 🚀 kills off all newcomers speedrunning bc even the manip won’t stop protect and explosion 💥 critical
Should have a gamba on how many fire blast misses there are 🤣
"Too bad to keep going" point
You should get a shiny qualava in this run
I knew I could count on you
hope to see that oddish dance ahain
Wait does the rng manip make it impossible for the qualava to be shiny lolol
what the heck was up with that guys hair?
was not paying attention to that
Where table so I can see if W or L
Eh it's fine either way you have the minimum for a good one anyways
no why did rants use imprison
AI in this game is mostly if you don't attack they don't attack
Just get better it ain't my fault
that went pretty well still now onto the oddish
so espeon and quilava are front in line makuhita is the mascot, meditite is support and plusle is backup, am I right?
and umbreon is the couch surfer
blaze with no flame wheel nice
now you can sweep the rest of this area thanks to oddish
it’s ok makuhita is a wall
all set and at home time to enjoy a strea with my besty
watch out for the mantine, the only Pokémon with a bst higher then 400 so far
don’t worry you’re about to crit everything in the next 4 areas
So how is this run's Umbreon?
this became such a run C!@#Blocker
no wait put the music back
They should put this theme in all games
why is this song so good
miror b knows what records to play
knew it was gonna be tough
I like this game a ton as a kid, but replaying it made me realize how slow the combat is
there is a romhack of it, I played it on 110%, it was bareable by that
also sorry, I am playing Splatoon rn
it is pretty good actually, more difficult, physical/special split, fairy type plus a ton of more avaible pokemon and new moves
but that is pokemon speedrunning, rng is a huge factor on it
so I've learned, I never activly speed run a game
kinda fun to see a typhlosion outspeed espeon tbh
I guess it depends on your SpA stat as well
I forgot when they changed that tbh
they changed it in gen 5
tome for new notes I guess
the area really has a nice vibe to it
I played a bit of the first xenogears
but other than that, I love the Xenoblade series
the 3, when there are 4 LUL
You wouldn't like it anyways unless you're a yu gi oh fan
Well it was master duel KEKW
i have over 600 hours in master duel
Well you'd be happy to know swordsoul is out for free
Bronze 4 on 4 new accounts here we go swifLFG
As long as it gets me full swordsoul, worth it
Dueling twice at the same time is not something I recommend
Specially playing naturia on one and swordsoul on the other KEKW
take the attack down a notch
are X items +1 or +2 in this game?
Game said no all run long Vibes.
now everything falls apart, that's a shame
do you know if this game has the same catch rates as GBA?
wow, is ORAS rayquaza was changed from 3 to 45
Oh hey it's the one Pokemon game that doesn't run like hot garbage on Switch
U trying to speed run, let's go, and coliseum???
I haven't touched let's go since the year it released but I do enjoy watching runs of it
I followed in late Oct 2021 when you started BN6 and lets go wasnt long after that
How did Colosseum go? I napped lol
Damn sounds like it was awful
Hopefully this goes nicer for you. So any more Colosseum runs?
Oh nice. Maybe do a mix of Colosseum and xd  😁
There's a manip on that one too?!
Wow did not know that. It only had 20 sp A tho didn't it? Was just a speedy one
Oh well then.... that doesn't make sense then
There any manips for this game?
what is a literal child doing my himself in a cave?
I'm am the ghost of the fallen cubones and I have come to steal your soul if you fail 3 out of 6 trivia question muhhahaha
Making a spread sheet for the first 3 gens catch rate so I have a general idea or how simple or difficult they should be
The rules 1. 5 guesses per mon 2 1 hint per mon effects may apply this is a game for your soul after all 3 you must have a overall score of 4 to keep you soul are you ready to begin? There is a 2nd lis or rules if ud wish to let chat par take
I put everything at max catch rate then sweep the game with whatever legendary is a surf encounter
100 has been my base line
I believe you can avoid spinners by pause buffering but not sure how difficult it is
I saw someone who's done lots of gen 3 speedruns doing it in rando so I assume there's a way to be consistent
Imagine trying to sneak past a spinner in multiworld and game stops you to say "Billy sent you a potion" then you get caught by the spinner LUL
Wait so in let's go eevee blue has Pikachu?
Well you understood regardless LUL I'm ignorant in let's go lore
youll see blue later on SS anne
Why can't this one evolve then Madge
Our starter is special and has +100 BST from others of its species
So basically good enough to train your sweeper
only 55 from gen 1 have a catch rate over 100, granted alot of those are ones you arent intended to catch like final stages
Yeah a Pikachu or eevee solo run even if it's +100 bst is kinda uh, well mid
Electric + Water is still pretty solid coverage
yeah, the fire move always burn, water always heals, elec always stuns, ect.
Thank God we hate that rat around here
phantom, imagine if baddy bad always caused flinch KEKW
Look at the bright side spinners aren't as fucked as in bdsp
Yeah spinners don't make any fucking sense really KEKW
I'm glad they became optional in this Gen and hopefully onwards
Im curious on how the emerald blind trainer setting works
There are good items but items aren't very necessary a lot of the time in S/V
I remember some of the held items were locked behind trainers too
I guess a lot of them can be bought but I want to say some of them were only in shops after beating the game
gl gl, how did Colo treat you?
stream was good, could have had 1:06:xx tonight
I thought there were more but I guess Eviolite was the only major one that's only available from trainers before postgame
was a minute ahead entering timelossus
Some also only appear in shops after a certain number of badges
and the 2 seconds ahead after armory and weston boo
Also the TMs are good but idk if any of them were exclusive
Earthquake was a trainer TM, 'nuff said
honestly if i actually practice boolossus and area 4 i could 1:05
None of the TMs were bad per se (except maybe Aerial Ace) but not really necessary in most cases either
Blizzard, Hydro Pump, Leaf Storm, Flare Blitz were among them
More singles than doubles I suppose
I just learned how to start with 99 rare candies
r u excited for pokemon let's go Wooper?
uh oh phantom has become a doubles chud
does champion trace have ~that~ pokemon?
I need a list of trainers who have one...
does giovanni have one in this game?
in his FR/LG battle they are both still rhyhorns
in his pokemon world tournament appearances it is evolved into a rhyperior....
You will never get a voltorb early
you will never have a custom SLOWPOKE kigurumi and battle new trainers in dark cave wearing it
You'll battle one in dark cave when let's go togepi comes out
unless u get lets go wooper instead
make sure u send supportive messages to ur nidoKING :)
muk crawled out of those bedsheets
This is the gym that made playing this game worth it
this is the gym that made MAKING this game worth it
this gym caught me off guard when i first played
DONT WASTE IT ON A WATER TYPE POKEMON?
WHAT IF I HAVE A VOLCANION?
so yesterday my local shop got a complete in box TMC listed for 200
sealed copy of xenoblade 3DS for 40, you cant even give that shit away LUL
I threw away all my gameboy game boxes the day i got them as a kid
i can vividly remember opening up leafgreen version
then disc games taught us all to keep the boxes
Oh nice they are. Was this game actually good?
btw tmc box only is worth 108.70 usd
Well tbf I haven't played a pokemon game since Diamond and Pearl
So I can't argue with you LUL
and you only use those joy cons for this game right?
do they have the based new hall effect sticks?
im just eager to see nintendos next controller
and pls dont be 80 bucks
and ship with a controller I actually want, dont make me buy it seperately
The controller for the Hyper Nintendo Entertainment System will be the Switch pro and wiimote controllers
i gotta go sleep but it was nice watching the stream! I hope the rest of the run goes well!
dont remember who I saw do this but you can use a rare candy to revive a fainted pokemon then heal it back up
that must be where I saw it then
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed trainers, and fellow Pokémon enthusiasts, Today, we gather here to pay our heartfelt tribute to a Pokémon that has left an indelible mark on our journey—a Pikachu that, despite our best efforts, was boxed and has now departed from our party. In the face of this loss, we find solace in the memories we shared, the battles fought, and the bond we formed, however brief it may have been. Thank you, Pikachu and screw you, Phantom. Cheer100
gonna dip here, have a good night
He's good for like most of the elite 4
What's the ideal time for a run
So just a pikachu and starmie
nice back in time for the e4
i wont be mad if you don't finish
strim was fun, had an all cards run that was good until it wasn't NiceSoftlock
Apparently 10% of stream was spent talking about potatoes
yeah potatoes came up on I think 3 separate occasions LUL
i think i was responsible for 2 of them
JCog actually forced one of her viewers to cook a potato during the stream D:
imagine replacing Blue with this loser
you're gonna eat this potato and you're gonna (not) like it!!
i had to, or risk her leaking my address and sin number pepeW
I mean it was indeed edible
My fav part is entering champion
I think this is the best champion theme
and entering champion is literally 10/10 goosebumps
is it you that's being recommended to me on insta? LUL
YEP only for about 6 months
what are they worth if you're just really cool?
NOTED but i am broke lol
think its Bedge time for me after you raid
ggs, thanks for the good lurk
my finger is on close page
i got the persona 3 remake
it fix a lot of the issue i had for the og version
it's like a slightly toned down p5r
the big 1 you can control your party members
they added all out attacks too
dungeons are better, not as good as p5 ofc
looking to an upscale of p4 though
makes you really appreciate p5 tbh
i played p5 1st also but i do really liked 4 golden
yeah i played a couple hours of p4g years ago, then dropped it quick, 100%'d p5 and then 100%'d p5r and now am playing p3 for the first time
i got the palatium for royal
you can get by doing tartarus 1-2 times a month
i only got to floor 10 so far
yeah, had to call it early. stopped at the start of FreezeMan's scenario
Yeah, still dry throat but I'm able to scream at Pallos
i haven't played LADX in so long
it's okay. we didn't see that
Boomerang kills deathl in 1 hit phanto274Smile
I’ve never played or seen this game so I have no clue what’s good
I’ve played breath of the wild and that’s it
those boulders seem a bit targeted to you
which letter? i hope its the E
they should add the flying items into the rando pool
what’s the point of a boat ride if you can swim
why was they’re a walrus chilling
i know chain chomp is an Easter egg but why is the chain chomp an item
which dungeon is face key for
aren’t bombs found everywhere or do you need to find a satchel or something for them
It's like that meme, "you can see sound"
"plays sick tunes" "hah, made ya look"
Mario sacrificed himself for your allowance
will be in and out but awsm ur playing my fave of all fave games
I’ll be right back I’m gonna real quick google the map of this game
Is the boomerang damage a rando change or is that item just busted in LA
the best Easter 🐣 egg 🥚 in history
bc they saw link 🔗 to the past players not use boomerang 🪃 much
Kirby looks different than I remember
If you talk to the kid you can run doom in zelda
Simply hit the weak spot with boomerang Kappa
I wonder if Pallos realizes that he's no longer in timeout
I mean, listening to the cave music sped up and higher pitch isn't also as special
getting all the pride instruments I see
What if I said it was my favorite boss?
why does he have the most health out of everything
So true cause my favorite boss is the big buzzblob
Petition to make egg capital "E" the Wind Fish Egg
You'll never recover from back pain
i hope you're well and glgl with rando HypeLove1
i feel like the two pear well together ngl
why is that delibird on the tracker
now you can make mewtwo your slave
Now you can find where to capture deoxys on the map
sadly this is emerald so it would be speed form
needs to be a chad firered randomizer
now you get increased speed in battle
That moon stone is for when the rayquaza ends up being a clefairy
he's part of the Sceptile community.
if you keep trying every night with your partner god will bless you with a gyarados
u got flash before dewford cave
what if each berry tree gave randomized items
what if you needed to grow berries to get key items
bro latias is doing almost as much damage at level 10 as that ratata
time to capture all the fishing pokemon
this isnt a nuzlocke is it?
where's the soulful and epic webcomic to go with
I know in vanilla, if you fish in petalburg....
did you catch the typhlosion i was in an ad
All the door labels on norman's gym could be bullshit in randomizer
ur rattata needs a rare candy badly
I know mice will chew through a candy wrapper
if i redeem a link awakening can it be dungeon ER?
you can see him when you're driving
Tangrowth is an OU chad monster
there a setting where you start with 9 hearts and you lose 1 when you beat a boss that sounds toxic
Tangela using rollout would be horrifying
I got lucky and caught a level 45 rat
speed boost slaking would be AG
tangela is standing like a flustered anime girl from a slice of life anime
now go back to the cave
i just give the seed id right?
ok i think it just the seed id i gen the same seed with it
I've also started genning seeds with 99 max repel
yeah it doesn't change anything you could save and restart after every step
no i did normal setting and it gen and said shuffling d2 and dungeon ER was off
i also have the log if you get stuck whenever you do it
NOW YOU CAN RIDE UP THE SANDY SLOPES
If only there was a way to skip pokenav
the secret house in this game inspired real life entertainment venues
can you ever forgive game freak?
graveler is the most 🦀 type pokemon
I got the retroachievement for the really good cycling road time
" Going All Out (5) (14) Get a time of 9.5 seconds or lower and 0 collisions on the cycling road. "
I’m assuming moves are also randomized?
more importantly, tangela usually doesn’t learn splash at level 32
I bet you like having wonder guard black listed
I did a seed once I had kill it with sandstream
I also got the retroachievement for GRINDING OUT THE GLASS TABLE IN THIS AREA
yeah it needs to become a sneasler
Starter with extreme speed is so good
Seed i did last night shaking had facade, flamethrower, earthquake, and thunder punch LUL
kindler bernie is gonna call u and invite u to the cook out
you can't just Earthquake all your problems
he took the oras latios you get right across that river
OMG my event ended and it was sooooo good
and glad to u still on
damn that raichu got a BOOTY
find the feebas encounter in this rando
if there were charmeleons in the grass would u let the kids play outside
pokemon games dont got routes like this any more
this route is like 2 of the alola islands
this route needs darkness like a cave too
look at the gen 1 ass backsprite
this isn't the japanese version so you actually do need the devon scope to fight the gym
bubble is worse than hp water
aoe damage aint worth that much
castform should hold an item so that its a check
Random question: Have you caught a Grass-type?
You need to have a grass type in your party for one of the checks in this game
local gamers so brainrotted they cant remember the winona gym puzzle by heart any more
Ooooo cheeky little ruby sapphire run
this is emerald wtf u mean
dont you see the GREEN CLOTHES
This is my exercise for today
okay i rolled a nat 1
you NEED to go faster now
Funny how you never notice if you just one-shot everything lol
you do notice when your level 73 rayquaza just barely doesn't one shot the elite 4 pokemon
Twitch ads REALLY want me to try refrigerated dog food in plastic packets
If you are in the run animation, trainers always aggro
Without having experience doing buffers myself, I think you would have dodged the encounter if you just let go of the B button
hey what pokemon is that and what does it evolve into
In that particular case, you would've hit the trainer regardless because you were running
now you can find out what rare and exotic creatures the safari zone owner has imported
Having a riding and flowery Charmeleon is funny as heck!
they didn't need to go so hard with outside mt pyre
this game's ost is so sick
Cómo hizo para tener a entei😳
Wait, is there a setting to make it all double battles?
he traded the entei in from his previous pokemon colosseum runs
phantom dies inside when he says a singles battle
But all trainers that can turn stare you down when you run
wobbuffet with slack off would be AG in gen 3
I think frozen should have been replaced with perma slow.
Was the complaint you had with the PokeNav just that trainers still bug you randomly?
The one time you don't so the manip too
Onix not so sturdy now after being randomized
I think it's by the start
stay out of the family pond
Not sure if placebo but the manip seems to be working pretty well
you didnt get the hiker on that cutscene
if bird type was in the game blaziken would be fire/bird
bro came here without the acro bike
lax incense now u can breed a munchlax
thats still funny to see and we are 2 away!
time for the 7.8 too much water saga
castform knew poison tail because its made of chemtrails
it took me 30 minutes to notice that lol
so youre detroying my time with about 2 hours
this was the firs tone I cleared too
what arre your overall thoughts on this one?
it makes me wonder is super rod is required for logic
I learned alot from this seed so thought it would be valuable for you too
now that youre here wanna know where waterfall was?
spoiler log said it was at the top of a waterrfall KEKW
skipping magma emblem was really nice too
yeah, I screen cap'd this LUL
also thanks for pull requests, I take it I did the map stuff right?
I didnt know how to combine everything so I sent it all seperately
I thought I sent a PR for the kid in restboro apartments, its the first building to the south exit, he gives a permierr ball in vanilla. Not a big deal as long as we know about it
thats what I went with too
entei and the 2 HM slaves KEKW
yeah i stopped marking the map but use to to see when areas open up
thanks for doing this, ill prob catch the vod on mon or tues
i forgot i had monster jam this week lol
just relaxing on my day off playing that kirby pokemon hack
just went through a series of emotions
title screen -> oh no did I miss it? -> 8 minutes live -> phew
i love your paper mario videos so much
is N-chapters the any chapters or the first ones specifically?
guessing you're not doing the weekly/
swifThink to be a twitch goblin or a football dumbass
Considering my dad is a 49ers fan, yeah, I know KEKW
Yooo Phantom good luck phanto274Smile phanto274GL
Has anyone discussed about a hint distro of sorts? And by that I mean one that doesn't literally just say X has X thing
To be fair in an rpg it shouldn't matter as much
Why the fuck would you use fool bozo
Goombario sounds like an excellent idea
"tattle on where the next thing is"
making goombario have some sort of use? quizmoPog
Another good one could potentially be signs as hints as well
And besides abused it's if you get lucky ggs, if not too bad
@SwiftPichu_ I do like this one
what’s the point of that electric power if it only lasts one hit
well just had my 1st game over is persona 3 remake
debating if I want a burrito after I take a nap
my son: "Does Phantom play Paper Mario every single day?"
red key para and upgrade to finish up this seed is great
"I hope they go through a secret door again where they drop down. That's so funny"
and then you just did them
so i just realized my new router uses WPA3
cause 3DS doesn't know what the fuck WPA3 is lmao
does it not also have WPA2?
i tried to adjust it to that, reset the router, still wouldn't connect
so i'm just using a mobile hotspot from my phone since i'm just uploading a pic from colors! 3d
good idea but alas, won't help my 3DS lol
I cleared out my StreetPass a few weeks ago at work and still somehow managed to get a few more passes
I feel like chapter 2 is most of the time 7 scaled
guess u can beat chapter 2 now Kappa
watch him show up in the shop
I just thought of a really stupid addition to the randomizer where the locked doors require a Radom key
most likely that’s why it’s stupid
I rolled 2 seeds that were norman sphere 2, so Im considering start with super rod but leave it in home PC and if I need it I can go back for it. I tried start with 10 rare candies and even that wasnt enough
ill be lurkin' while i watch the usherbowl + make ribs :3
yeah and if I need it I have to spent time going home for it
what if we added more badges to the pool like you need 6 badges to fight norman?
time to go meteor shower the toy box
ill have to play around with that and see what works
locking norman behind 4 gyms is an option too but i find the badges more interesting
so second second seed norman gave knuckle badge which put steven in logic, and soda pop house had surf opening that up
so if I did the letter out of logic I wouldve been fine
and the first seed it would put cut in logic opening the woods and route 116
if you have money too, its not as cheap as lets go
a few neatly drawn boxes could help with the minesweeper tracker. gl hf btw
Wild, this long and no other partner
how do you tell the three toads apart on the tracker?
the three that look th same in a column
its the one by the castle, I forget his name
i havent touched this game in awhile lol
i never noticed thats who they are arranged
I forgot today was football day
I wanted to forget today was football
so the chain starts and ends with goompapa
i was wondering how you were gonna do this
imagine having to return here for panels
because you did the skip maybe?
I guess I missed that dialogue for minimal cutscenes
they ask you the warp question, but that should be everything
is the insecticide herb a rando thing?
icebound, thats an interresting write up you did about the minh T seeds. Throwing black toads is really clever
that's how pape does it all over the place, I stole the idea from the original devs lol
so when I locally gen a seed it zuto runs bizhawk, well that bizhawk window doesnt read any inputs and I can even rebind my controls
it wont even take keyboard input for me
if I open bizhawk normally tho that is fine
its just when archipelago opens it
bombette looks like a lemon candy LUL
with the release of the sora amiibo on friday im prob gonna organize all my amiibo into a tier list on the shelves LUL
with a post it on each shelf for S A B C and Trash
Olimar will def be in trash tier LUL
how do you make an egg missile?
fine until I needed a fortress key that was in rowf 2
mr zebra actually raced too today
iamgine hammering a tree and egg falls on marios face
truer words never spoken by a got
Axl SS and I made some notes finally for BN2 that cater to us lmao
at first I read that I thought, "who is Axl SS?" KEKW props on the notes tho
did the LC ever get added to the board?
Our notes basically just tell you what to do in order, with no direction mostly, so it assumes you know the route lol
hey phantom, do you know what this means? You can have a free WR with delete dive man buster max Cheer100
just make sure you get your bustermax runs in before jugoomba
its weird how you can toggle GBA buster max
only 4 5 and 6 are updated
sorry ice bn2 isnt updated LUL
they need to get those boards up
you submit a run they have to do it
i'll have the full run learned by tuesday
do a bn2 run and submit it bn6. Thats what id do
of a 5-chapter LCL blitz, I still managed to go into a chapter not required thinkning otherwise KEKW
Buit I did finish within 30 minutes of 1st place so thats a goal accomplished
2:44:29 (me who is learning lol)
not the worst for sure, but not nice or easy in the beginning for sure
chapters were 1 3 4 5 7
4 + 6 are my faves to have included
sounds like where I used to live
Uber Eats'ing 2 burritos cuz apparently it's a buy one get one free
lol, Troopa ate shit in front of 3 people
ah, right, you cleared last seed while I was asleep
thought you were going back to Koopa Fort for some reason
I'm waiting on my dinner to arrive
Ah yes, storing the turtle in the cupboard
wait when did THIS update drop
showing how many checks you have done
its been a hot min since i picked up rando lmao
i should try rando at some point
i like it but i get anxiety and tell myself i suck so i never want to try it lmao
but idk any glitches except merlon skip phanto274Smile
and glitchless rando sounds like a difficult time
This is why we throw Yobbi in the volcanos
This be looking like a real thumper.
Tracker says you have another letter
"And suddenly the seed got thrown in the trash"
God that sounds like my OoS rando yesterday
Willard sent me a version of the rando that lets me start with sword
So I'm gonna probably use that one from now on
I can send it to you
Yeah but think of the BM you did to tutenkoopa
Idk blasting tutenkoopa in the face with 3 egg bombs is worth the time loss
one last middle finger from this seed
I only have 8 friends :(
I can't even share with 10
Darn must of just missed it GJ on clearing the randos. ur streaming schedule is sweet.
Drank too much last night, now I'm laying in bed chillin lmfao
It was a good time, im not sick just super tired
is this game just to get in the mode of manipping for kirby hundo PAUSERS
yeah just do that but for like an hour straight
yo I come in clutch for you always pal
But he's playing pikmin and I wanna watch pokemon
They put pickles on my burger frick
Oh I did bully ohrocks last night I guess
It's all alone with white digimon
Makuhita would be a good plush he's just a punching bag
oh yeah how did I forget him
do you believe in magic phanto274GL
you get my actual dollars now
then you'd get more of my dollars woa
phantom you should use this ffurret I bet he's really strong
ah yes, Ekans signature attack... high jump kick phanto274Eyeroll
im doing a 6 badge on norman on my DS without opening the tracker lol
Darn the reset came hunting for u
running starter crawdaunt with speed boost and caught an early on flash fire herracross
next time can I give bits and have brian count for you?
I do trolly stuff like that in another stream all the time, they have brian speak for 300 channel points so we kinda go wild with it LUL
sounds like bn4 all over again
gl phantom VoHiYo this run seems stupid brutal
Gone for 15 come back and it's right where I left phanto274ColonD
would you try grand colosseum as a one off thing?
for the 3 legendaries you can swap them with the birds or regis which you could make a discord poll out of that
nothign a wuick claw wont fix
ran into a trainer who's battle sprite has a baby and see sends out a rayquaza, now im imagining the baby crying its head off LU
Mega Rayquaza is so broken it became a smash boss.
Duking is literally the meme with the super muscley guy typing behind the computer
oh just realized I caught a grovyle early on so dont need to worry about the dumb grass check
made it my HM slave so itll be in the party
i hate this, magma emblem on route 119 without fly
@Axl_SR are you playing Emerald or a romhack or something?
wanted to try 6 badges on norman but didnt feel like streaming so playing on DS
also started a vanilla ruby playthru and the trainer layouts are very different
Yo, have fun with venus KEKW
Oh wait the suicune should target espy anyways
Crawdaunt will make use of mystic water tho
As if cast form wasn't already fucking terrible, V2 coming right up with truant
Well now you have 3 queued up KEKW
Ah OK cool, I lost count
iirc it fucks up a bit but not like, major
I love the music in this game
Do you have any plans to do Gale of darkness?
it's okay when it's dead it can't outspeed EZ
glad I rememberr before I got there, I cant do magma base without strength lol
cool speedrun list! How do you have the patience? I could never speedrun a game without worrying about how many mistakes I'd make
nevermind i do have it, just not the heat badge
Last speedrun I did was resident evil village. And that was before any notable skips were found lmao
ooh did you save the speedrun on twitch?
You gonna make it back with the new knowledge
sees sheer cold *screams YOU NEED TO DIE!*
I'll never get over Numel's damaged animation
heat badge finally in mt pyre, now to do magma and aqua bases
I don't like Pokemon randos as much for some reason
not gonna lie, childhood Axl raised the plusle to level 54
I couldn't even use a Plusle as a child
USe Protect and bait everything into that slot surely COPIUM
I was gonna say I remember it being fairly late
Eagun is actually Ash and here's why
dive locked behind cut by rustboro, i hate everything cause I have 3 room keys
wait how does anything get locked behind rustboro?
2 checks behind cut trees east of rustboro and 3 checks in petalburg forest
so i did the ship and was like i didnt do stevens letter, then i go back to mr stone and he gives room 1 key phanto274Eyeroll
Did you get a good SpA one?
you ever just stop and ask who comes up with these wack-ass names
Funniest part of the run for sure LUL
Dakim makes a bit of sense, he dacked him in the face
I need to go to slayport before aqua base right?
I kinda wonder if you were able to clip into the jail cell you could get to The Under early
wish i had the SS ticket right now LUL
Your movement options are walk quickly or inch along
The only thing I could think of is manipulating Rui in a spot so she would force you out of bounds or something
Are gender ratios the same? dang that's lucky
dark suicune was my fave team rocket card
glad its owner is my fave queen
fly was in aqwua base... i hate everything
Ah dang the 75% reduction Sadge
what type is Espeon's hidden power?
is they’re any area you’re sure you can make up for lost time? phanto274Bless
We gotta claw our way back
wow... room 1 had TM41 Transform LUL
Wait. Do you not have to fight the ludicolo squad?
Oh shit. Shows how long it's been since I've played this game LUL
ok gonna go real quick gotta shut down to clean keyboard and hands.
He reminds me of the Goron from ocarina of time
Yeah just play the song and he won't wanna fight anymore
Slapped in the booty with ads brb
yeah it would be Venus huh
I finally found rain badge giving go mode, was in pacilog currents fuck that
well im not using any maps or anything lol
Venus mailed us a good one.
That horn sounds like it'd play over the speaker at Portillo's
yo he gained the power of knowledge and is gonna destroy this speed run phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam
probably gonna be lurking soon persona 3 is just too good
so been playing more of ruby today
you get no phone calls and that is amazing
yeah, I walked out and thought "why didnt mr stone call me?"
I do know they do plan to add berry checks to the pool
free time save for next run Kappa
when that door opened it just showed outside like its literally just a door frame LUL
here is something funny, when you fight jumpluff look at its shadow
yesterday I was listening to a didyouknowgaming vod
do you have a goal in mind for this category?
its weird to see people actively running bn2
it doenst want to come with us
what do u need  them to do
very lost on hoe this gets u a espyon
Yes made it in time. Hope everyone is well. Did u get the snow?
Hopefully run today goes better than yesterday! phanto274GL
That's a pity. The quilava was so good yesterday
why perfect espyon and not perfect umbreon
my fave eevee is the ghost and dragon type on deviantart.
but official canon its glaceon both the shiny and reg
my fave shiny eevee though is leafeon and espeon mutation over blue ringed umbreon.
@darkapplequeen 5 royal, I wanna finish this before going to another one
@SwiftPichu_  i beat 3 reload it fun
I know it is don't worry, no spoilers emerldRiot
me got p5 installing for tomorrow
Weird, but I also was around before Charizard was even in the burning rng
Now you see why I said welcome to reset hell
all these poor umbreons and espyons in the bin
to give extra luck have espeon on ur shoulder
lol, the jingle keeps waking me up
I’m guessing this isn’t going to be a casual run you do after the month is done lol
Couldn’t happen any other way LUL
Surely they’ll figure out an rng manip for Quil Clueless
Yeah that might be a little yikes
this game would be to perfect if that was added
my reaction to any children near me:
hi, so is the battle mode thing you did at the beginning for starter manip?
Pokemon Fun Fact: In pokemon emerald when you do the tag battle with Steven you can selfdestruct to give Metang all the E X P. If Metang gains 2 levels it learns Iron defense and you can pick when move it forgets. Also if you mod the exp gains you can evolve Steven's Metang into Metagross which is the wildest thing ever. Cheer100
ill link the video I saw it in
rigby is doing an emerald rando, so far 5 badges, HM03, mach bike, and go goggles
I'm a fifth of the way to channel point goal
Poor seedot. Stored all that energy to just go soft LUL
come next month im gonna miss this ost
Did you get a good one this run
Flinches should be removed from pokemon outside of fakeout
They have harmed me for my entire life
Child me got double/triple flinched so many times
Pikachu needs to be dealt with
looks like you are making up good time, looking at all the gold splits
at least this time it isn't faster than espeon LUL
Lets dance on the 10 floors
you can really have bad luck with good luck LUL
so basically a magnitude 5 would have been fine I guess
I don't think I have ever watched this speedrun before. How is it?
Yo Phantom GL on the colo kidroc1Bless
It's been a hot min since I've watched/ran colo
Yea I've been a colo mod for that long
I've been around psr since about Nov 2019
Yea frlg was my first run, I want to expand my games it just sucks because manips plus time to run has gone down recently lol
Plus frlg tourney each year takes up some time for me
You plan on doing any of the main series pokemon games other than let's go?
Gonna lurk for now got work in the morning but GL kidroc1Bless kidroc1Lurk
I never understood why they gave you a lvl 13 plusle anyway
At least make it have perfect ivs and some good exclusive attacks. But no it sucks
Okay, I need an explanation for these strats now
@Schmueh tough to explain. but u reset for ur pokemon start.
Well, I am stuck in ad hell
I guess it's faster to lose those battles and go back in and you don't need the exp
Also I didn't know the dna samples are randomly generated
Just do a tas run, easy
but ye, we playing pikmin 4
i'm doing a big ol marathon of the pikmin games, and this one is the last stretch
he's like half the reason play this game
why are you fighting a monkey
Like WHY on earth did they decide to give a TREE SAPLING, NIPPLES?
probably a preferred option to morning wood
Endgame of the mon is here
Other than the fact in a weird way he reminds me of sephiroth
half the trainers feel like their just a pokemon fusion themselves
@Tandris I do think they eat the DNA of their mon no lie
I was tweaking the emerald layout, but like the old one more so I changed everything back to the way it was LUL
Houndoom not living on one? PAUSERS
Hello all you amazing people! I hope you're all having a wonderful night!!!
phanto274GG phanto274GG brugglGold brugglGold tippiEgg tippiEgg popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_SG popesPOGGERS_TK
Ho-Oh just killed a guy POGGERS
u got a marathon or something?
She did say she would do another run if that changes your mind
perfect timing, wrapping up the Kirby 64 video you uploaded
how high are we counting today?
have you looked at red blue rando? there is talk imseeing about it needing money but all I can think of is safari zone
that sound horrible I want it
sounds like jumpless in pape KEKW
i saw that in discord LUL
how's the colo learning been treating ya
quil isnt too bad cause you tend to know early on enough if it's bad but even then fights later on can be rough
never actually did runs of this tho when i learned it, need to get back to it one of these days
so ive started playing platinum casually and I love the bag compared to emerald. Not having medicine and battle items in the main item bag is so freakin good
I am looking forward to when platinum AP happens
since it is being worked on
could just look at the other DS AP uses
i'll run colo whenever i have a gamecube again, and a rt4k to put my carby into :)
going on the internet and telling lies? D:
I heard that people speedrunning this were using a special save file that fixed the IVs of the Espeon and Umbreon, is that what you're doing?
im a dum dum, there are a few DS games in the works so I just assumed at least 1 DS game was done
Ah I wasn't sure, it was this and Mario Sunshine that had that sort of thing considered but I never learned what either actually did
tfw Sephiroth learns he isn't the ultimate life form
the most tragic thing just happened. I tripped over my DS charger, my DS fell and the game flew out. I havent saved since I picked my starter phanto274Cry
Good Espeon with early manip. Sounds good to me
maybe that means its a good quilava phanto274Thonk
I shouldn't of wished it luck :(
Like, I got my problems with this game with how slow it can be but the 54 checks goes on for so long it gets funny
hungover after working through a 24 oz water bottle of vodka this early morning
No, I just need 1 audio cue on the title screen
And then fuck it up and get Elec
I actually heard your metronome lol
Yo phanto274GL  been here for awhile but was afk
Rider Willie? If you say so
nvm that Misty went a majority of the anime w/ midriff showing
every game you play has such good music
what would this theme be called
Colosseum Battle 1 (Normal Battle - Pokémon Colosseum)
miror b is the only theme we need
there's an evil team fight song, and a normal trainer fight song, but this song is used so much it may as well be the normal fight theme
I think with Not Sephiroth they were just trying to be artsy or something
why is Lonely a nature that exists in this kind of game
A: Oh no! Anyway, kick their asses, Wes!
ok i am actually here now what did i miss
NOOO dont beat up the furret
this quilava is 31 everything i assume
come on phantom it's pronounced murr bee not meer bee. oh you meant the friend to all luidicolos carry on :P
okay so I dont use steam, but I got an email saying a game on my wishlist is on sale. So I changed my password. Then when I go to my wishlist its empty. I think steam is just to get me to come back LUL
also the game was something I never heard of
looks like coaster tycoon with online
back from dinner and Yo little caesars gave us a free crazy bread
I will say one cool thing about archipelago is with bn3 you can save, use an unlocker, send your item, then soft reset KEKW
my mom bought 2 and there was 3 in the bag so guessing little caesars fucked up
Spheal is so sad when fainting
Roses are red, Violets are blue. Omae wa mo shindeiru Cheer100
Hello and GL on your run
alerts are broken but hope you like my poem
His xd theme is better tho
I forgot yesterday so reminder to look at jumpluff's shadow
Man fuckin NAruto ran outa there
prob cause its easier to animate, Sonic has ran like that since dreamcast days
Don't forget to equip the exp share on time as well
is catching or killing tyranitar at the end faster?
Do you have to catch AND purify everything?
That sounds annoying. But then again you have all of battle mountain
Shows how little they think of Dakim. Only put him at floor ten 💀
Who Needs An Entei? We Got a Typhlosion Baby!!! x3 DinoDance
R u winning im finaly back
Now just get good dna samples
Or just go for the yolo strat and guess all 3
what am i eating with my spoon
No worries! Gotta spread the Colosseum love wherever possible
but im carrying  IM the espeon
Doing a HC nuzlocke of XG and just lost the bulk of my mons, but overall was really fun all the same thanks :) How were your Espeon and Typhlosion stat rolls?
Modded Colosseum so know how much hidden BS there is with the purification rates hahah
does that mean i come back
Yeah in my Grand Colo nuzlocke the crit rate boost was a godsend
How long have you been speedrunning colo for?
everything is blank except for  jan and feb
Right gonna head off now as stream was 5 hours and I've got a hunger brewing, nice chatting! Best of luck with this run :)
I love how hitmontop got a better defensive profile and is actually good in grand colosseum
Espeon still the OP Special Sweeper he's always been
Hey Phantom, have you ever watched the Steamed Hams skit from The Simpsons?
I gotta link you something you might like later
It's Steamed Hams in the style of Megaman Battle Network
Oh no, I dropped the Lift Key
Oh snap, you're just wrapping up
Personally, Glaceon is my favorite Eeveelution. Same Special Attack, but more defense (at the cost of speed)
And breaks the OR-AS Delta episode since it's mostly against Dragon types
Ein is bad and unfair in these runs? fatpidTHONK
gl for the rest of the run fwiw
Everyone likes this theme but I think the Peon theme is better
Using that Full Heal performs a glitch, doesn't it
oh god I just realized, you RNG manip for a special HP don't you for these runs
fuck i missed nascour's theme 😔
iirc it only went up to 60
Santa Claus? No screw that. This is Dr. Eggman
I hate sand...it's coarse...and rough...and irritating...and it ruins speedruns everywhere
sounds like me with LM just now KEKW
Sent you the BN Steamed Hams in Discord DM
Modest being bad is so weird why is it like that LOL
Espeon was just pissed their umbreon friend got replaced and had to kill it
writing this long message to see if it gets added to markov
how do i redeem a game to learn?
im curious if this is fun
is this on pop tracker too?
yeah. not a fan if colloseum so im glad for a bit of variation
No way u do classic randoes!
i remember why I hate bn2 LUL
+12 minutes im not doing freeze KEKW
what are the settings listed on your tracker?
oh boy, time to strength some trucks, gl hf!
imagine if text speed on the right is the slowest LUL
man FUCK john what a dick
btw, I found my DS action replay so now I have all the event items on platinum like azure flute, member card, secret key, and oaks letter
i forget that moves like it and wrap are actually broken this gen
Had to go AFK for a bit. What have I missed?
Also how does this work? First time to one of the Pokemon streams lol
is it just get 8 badges to get to pokemon league
I presume roadblocks don't exist then?
i forgot gen 1 only had 5 HMs
No Police in Cerulean, Tea guards, etc
did gen 1 have rock smash?
fly was the one I forgot
I always found it pointless how cut and rocksmash serve the same purpose
Viridian Forest? More like Cerulean Forest amirite?
cant wait to see you hold B on the bike KEKW
legendary, majestic bird pokemon, goes around just pecking at grass dwellers for funsies
So yeah, Moltres is great for now lol
yo running shoes in red phanto274BLANKIES phanto274Jam phanto274BLANKIES
unironically master ball is pretty cheap
why is every Pokémon level 5
when you said "gen 1 sleep is cancerous" I swear I heard that in Ouro's voice LUL
why do you wanna learn boring64?
Pretty sure that was 1HP left lol
he was at one hp lol
refreshing my wifi box be back later.
At least this is some good EXP
Wait what? You can run from Fire Spin but not attack?
That's the complete opposite from how it works now
so somthing I learned today, in the gen 4 games the dark caves are actually lit. They just place a black texture over camera's field of view.
This early that's an almost guaranteed OHKO
we can sweep the next 50 trainers easy
why does dratini have rudolf's nose?
so thats good in early game
save that candy for when dragonair gets to level 54
yooooo we can sweep with everyone
What's he supposed to have? Double Hit doesn't exist yet
fact was so fun I’m already tying the noose just thinking about it
are rare candis a bonus in this or detriment?
@gyroguy123 The struggles of Gen 1
kanapeWave Whats the good word (and yes Itemfinder is 🗑️ )
Didn't you use your Dragon Rage TM?
the best thing in this game yes
I forgot how cute Dratini was in Gen 1
dratini is so huggable the worminess of glory
Dratini is always cute liquiid it’s dratini
It's almost like a modern game!
1000 for bubble and 1500 for poison powder?
I thought trainers didn't fight after the gym leader is beaten
65 bucks for that fight why
Lots of items down here isn't there?
that golbat is funny as heck!
Gold duck is the troll of the seed
once dratini gets thunderbolt we should be good on Golduck
Still gonna die on the way sadly lol
Mm yes, that Carbos is called Swift
According to Bulbapedia... Though its power is listed as 130, the target's Defense will be halved during damage calculation (unless it is at a value of 1), effectively doubling the power to 260.
In Gen 2 it was 200 base
The Defense drop didn't stop until Gen 5
Explosion was 170 in Gen 1, and 250 in Gen 2. Everything else is the same
ok unmuted and ready to go
why would a water be enough to get past boarders
is this a new type of speed run for you?
dratini evolves at 30 right ?
sand slash is so leaned in
I mean you can run back to the pc now since the boat doesn’t leave until yo talk to the captain
Clearly the EXP. All was the beginning of the end
please just never use this move
it’s 90 accurate in this Gen
was fun until i kept dying to bowser and said fuck it 🤷‍♂️
oh i can! i just haven't checked discy today LUL
yeah haven't done a ton of the blitz settings so wasn't ready for it lol
Aight I'm gonna go grab something to eat. Try not to break the game while I'm gone
don’t think he’ll have choice in that gyro
double slap hit more than twice thats not double then is it
any of you ever see the toad jumpscare in Mario tennis
you see, he gave you the HP Up because fishing is a way of life
electabuzz looks so normal compared to everything else
iirc there's only 2-3 required ones left
Isn't there a choice between two unavoidable battles in the maze?
so I just caught rotom, I got it to 2HP and paralyzed and got it in a permier ball. It was an easy catch for a catch rate of 45
see I told you we’d get ice beam just believe
everytime i see some pokemon i have that mental not of phils noises.
it can't just be that you accidently hit them, every single one has to have 4-5 pokes
Alright I'm back. Did you break the game?
i forgot eggecute looked like that
fishing is a way of life, so as fishermen they give you hp up so you have more life to fish
That would be Pokedex if he wouldn't give you a random item in return!
calling oak has the master ball
I feel like that's the equilivent of what you'd get if the safari zone secret house was real
golem looks like a dwende in this game
Damn, Neo Team Rocket would've made a fortune off its tail
oh damn they finally got it
If Oak doesn't have anything are you softlocked?
so is it a hidden item under ground
You beat Giovanni in Celadon, so I don't see why not
are the coins in the casino random items
Hidden Items aren't in the pool
yooo vaporeon was for pretty decent deal
And you need to have Surf for Power Plant, right?
I think if you open the Pokemon menu, the map lights up for a few frames
Ok so, you got every item in Safari Zone, cleared SS Anne... Mt Moon...
Eevee check at the top of the building in Celadon is a random mon, right?
Are vending machines randomized? Do those even exist in this game?
Hii Phantom phanto274Smile how are you tonight?
Did you get the item north of Nugget Bridge?
So you shouldn't be anywhere near here right now
that item is very out of logic
Did you get the potion from the mart guy on route 1?
So you have to go back to Oak 3 times
i forgot that was a think
He gives you the Dex after Route 1 stop
5 Pokeballs after parcel, and then another 5 after rival
You didn't talk to him at the start, so you got the Pokedex check as well as the parcel check
I might have been reading the item list wrong.
I dunno where that third item came from
I'm on the Bulbapedia page for Oak's lab, and only two items are listed under RBY. I didn't notice that and assumed they were all for RBY, FRLG, HGSS
Lets Go Pikachu and Eevee has 7
Yeah, most of the Lets Go checks are the stones
Rock Climb after all 16 badges
And Jade Orb from Groudon and Kyogre from Embedded Tower
Aight, Imma be quiet now, cause I feel like I've been spamming a lot. Want to give other people a chance to chat lol
Too bad it wasn't Fly though lol
Also you're welcome for the clarifying. I like helping
Understated how much of a dickhead Blue is / was that he infiltrated a Rocket occupied building JUST to fuck with you
Blue nor Red helped u out against giovonni even regarding the fact its there kin family member.
Compared to moving spinners, anything is better lol
whomever decided trainers move / react to walking & running, I hope they got the help they needed
G1 Seel was SUPER derpy, holy moly
Ah, there's 3 hidden items in Seafoam
I miss that Golbat sprite so much
What's the "john" for this loss, John?
also Machamp is just a playground bully. "Where's my 5 bucks, bud?"
and then the electric type joins
"I lost my Master Ball, but this is good enough, right?"
like a mother getting Gario Bros at the store instead of Mario
You don't have a PokeDoll for Copycat
damn, Red Nurse Joy is kinda underrated, imo
Marowak took the doll with it to the afterlife
It knows what you pick and then chooses a move accordingly
legit forgot Tangela was a Grass type
also trainers dont use pp in red/blue. They can use moves infinitely
if sleep's not bad enough for ya, freezing mf'ers is always an option
me begging my mon to wake tf as they're getting their ass beat
I think FRZ is 10% chance to break out per turn?
or get hit by a fire attack
I thought that wasn't until G2
I think USING a fire attack breaks FRZ in gen 2
damn, these questions ARE made for Twitter
oh, actually gen1 freeze is naturally unbreakable. Ice heal, hit by fire type move that inflicts burn, or if the opponent uses Haze.
I've been wondering that myself for the longest
that 70% feels too much like a coin flip at the worst of times
also apparently in gen1 there was a way to get 63 PP on a move by being frozen
RGBY were held together with hopes, dreams and whatever office supplies they had handy
damn, that's one crazy ass rope
JR-TRAINER are just boy / girl scouts, change my mind
who's this random ass just chilling near an abandoned power plant
Wait, they can switch out in this gen???
May or may not be the last sub/t2 for a while, finally splurged and got turbo
Also no Fly is unfortunate but could be worse
Better than Emerald currents without Fly...
I was about to make fun of John for not being friendly to Golbat. Forgot Crobat doesn't exist in this game
HahaSweat  that metapod almost got you
popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_HF stupid143GG stupid143GG phanto274GG phanto274GG tippiEgg tippiEgg popesPOGGERS_SG popesPOGGERS_TK PogChamp minimi6Pog
I signed up for an async testing upcoming R/B entrance rando changes
ok my fave on the planet shall start
hope you have a good rando
are they characters besides Mario you can play in Rando?
I feel like shit a bit. I felt like more shit earlier. I ate too much today LMAO
oh I wanted to ask. While I was ohheyi30Lurk I noticed that the guard at the elite four asked for how much stuff you got. Could you ask for all 150/151 or no?
or set it up that way I mean
in that case, the alternate version's pokes will be in your game?
and trading pokes would be evolved another way?
100% the pokedex, in a RANDO ? ? ?
In-n-out could never have chili cheese fries
I would think maybe because it's bullshit, but I could be wrong PrideLaugh
I won the race over Lopez!
ignore the fact that he died to Bowser and DNFed
but I PBed by 7 and a half minutes so it was pretty good
well shit, that's a dub pb
So Sword on 10 Shells, yeah?
I've been itching to do a PMR again, but I need to read all of the new updates PrideLaugh
Oh, is only 20 enabled in this setting?
yeah this was my first run with all clean fights so I can definitely save the last minute and a half
@OhHeyItJaye it's so nice with the new minimal cutscenes
I bet. I haven't played since like, the end of season 0?
I also did seed#1 of the asyncs and was quite rusty LUL
oh no you said the word, now the seed will be terrible KEKW
whod you feel about red/blue rando?
Put some habanero Heinz ketchup and it wasn't terrible
Been sick all week, your vods have been such a blessing phanto274Bless
That is by design, you can switch tunic between your options at a phone booth. If you have an tunic color override, you can see your current tunic in the [SELECT] menu inside your inventory screen.
the hookshot glitch is in logic
is the a logic check to see what is flagging it
that the only way to get it right now i am pretty sure
If you go to the left side
The tracker must think you're on that logic
You'd have to show me that
Down the stairs, and go over the orange tiles
You can super jump on top
Knowing that super jump for d7 makes it so much faster
If you look inside the seashell it just says "lmao idiot"
is this a check you can only peak?
You teleported to his hands lol
I tried doing bomb triggers, and it wouldn't let me
If you fire 2 bomb arrows at him, he dies
so jelly right now, Japanese Mcds gets kirby toys
I mean it's called Key cavern
It's the OST for this dungeon LUL
You can go back to d8!
Funny enough there's 1 extra key in this dungeon
A cock in the water level
its 2am here and i have to stay up for 1 more hour Sadge
and i am not a sub Sadge
interesting, I have black bars on the sides cause watching on a wide monitor and the emotes that drop from being first also spill over the black bars
well its in the vod if you wanna see it
I started emerald but got tired and hungry, shame too cause Peeko gave me fly
Give us this day our daily pape
it went to mauville, which was dope cause i had no badges yet
And lead us not into TTYD
did you peak the spoiler log for it?
interesting, it doesnt show the rain emotes in the vod
what is sushi’s purpose in this seed phanto274Thonk
playing platinum im using a team ive never used before. Vaporeon, Scizor, Gliscor, Houndoom, and Rotom Mower. Still need to decide on the last one.
badges are all pretty cheap at least
no ch 5 means ultra hammer could be in haven shop LUL
some nice checks in the desert
so what is this about today?
@Mirby_Studios could u do a co op with phantom or would u make a bad team mate?
@Mirby_Studios like on a pape or pokemon rando.
i've only beaten the game like once lmao
popesHmm priidiHmm minimi6Hmm popesHmm_HF that does prove diffulty.
i'm mostly just confused why you asked right when i entered lol
I kinda wanna see dif content and how he would navigate it.
Mario looks like building mario with that pallet
why do the stairs in his house have the ability to retract like it’s his attic
but the fireplace is up there
who can blame you with these key designs
sushi finally got a use after a whole 80 minutes
it’s something for her to do
predicting power bounce in peach’s castle
i'll have to get used to it lol
Luigi can take his mansion and shove it <redacted>
and armory and weston boos can also <double redacted>
armory went to the right side room after going into the hallway instead of back into armory, cellar boo got away at 8 health, weston boo went to pipe room twice. a tale as old as time
it could have been, cellar through weston was my last chance to save enough time. an earlier run died to a 4 cycle boolossus
that earlier run was like 30 ahead out of area 2
ok dinner time be back later if ur on
Just in time for the end
But what if I'm a switch
yea, this looks like seed 7
Which led to my eventual demise
but I'm gonna try the seed again tomorrow
I was only half paying attention to the seed so....
I'm still getting used to playing on console, there are a few small differences
back from dinner and oh we are on a second
I’ve had a on/off fever all day and it gets high and it hurts
yeah stream is a major distraction im ngl
hey, how did u get blue mario?
how'd you manage to get that?
i come back from afk and see ramen
you need to know what u doing then lol
i'm waiting for the release of paper mario thousand yr door on switch
they say 2024, but idk till when
i haveto imagine we're getting a direct soon
how long u been playing paper mario for?
how come u don't block sometimes?
how come u trying to be at 1 hp?
mega rush gives massive damage for being in peril
so as long as you can mitigate dying via blocking and other mitigation then you just trounce bosses
I'm about 90% confident Phantom is playing this seed exactly as I did
I actually forget where this is
i got a key though a wall (but in the switch version) does the glitch that lets you clip inside work?
ohh i think i know unless u did it already
you just checked the first 3 items on the storefront i think
i was thinking you didn't go back to anti guy
at least i got to see my fave cloudy guy
after beating 7 i think you just walked past rolf after talking about it
I’ve barely had danger Mario recently
OMG rare rage bonus content. Lets kill it
But some of those final fights are brutal
could we have a way to guarantee life shrooms in a shop?
you could most likely code a way to make that a thing but that up to the devs
Just trying to think how to reduce the spike from four chapters to final
think this seed want u too win
Fumes def been settling in now
genesis melee is getting spicy catArrive
are Bombette and kooper the only partners that can’t hit flying enemies?
does anti guy have a powerbounce cap? like bosses
Back at it again with the randos. How's the seed?
im trying to fight him for the first time (got him to 9 hp (if i got a lucky i would of won (30 bp, 10 fp and hp + 1 fp and hp badge)
no, i want fight him now without watt
@scrambleddragons asynchronous means not at the same time
It's one of those slow start seeds
marcoRNG marcoRNG_HF all of it we can get
okay I feel slightly more human
phanto274Lurk how has this seed been
Bombette was there for moral support
only partner you need for moral support honestly, all the others are fake af
maybe bow too i guess, but i'm never confiding in goombario for sure
Dang we are lucky. What is this? Three seeds in one night
are the sewers hidden blocks, in the area with the upgrade block not their untill later (im in toy chapter)
I keep forgetting this is the day you go for longer to do all seeds
I can't believe Jr became a goth girl Sadge
You could of just triple shooting star then watt charged him
I've been ohheyi30Lurk so I saw you did 3 randos PrideLaugh
think its Bedge time or do i play more persona 3 hmm
but the game is almost over ice
Mario Story - Bowser, My Old Enemy!
Do you have the twitch income listed on the taxes or are you below $600 on here
how many fails before the secret prepared gamecube memory card with the juicer espeon.
what pokemon was that bottom middle
Amish are you out there smoking big doinks in Amish?
I saw this last time and u got annoyed
Started the game with a firered/leafgreen team
bottom middle of that skarmory one
so this is ovieously rng manip, after that your espeon will be basically perfect?
Espeon won't be perfect, just usable
waiting for a perfect one can take quite a while
maybe you get a Typlosion that is faster than espeon again
Cool to see what the too looks like too
an incredible espeon means you will get a bad quilava
Why did he bring the umbreon if he's the one using thief
on how many fps does this game run?
that is fricking hard to get
I thought with 30fps it would be reasonable, but that is hilarious LUL
why did u start timer before u said yes
[-and then 20 seconds off wr  would SUCK
image a 10 second wait then then being like 10 seconds off wr   would be a ass
i think  in grand colosseum they give all shadow mons perfect ivs
and you might be able to change your nature? but I am not sure
think about it tho   hospital and all my probbys
the epic 2 second battle is blocked by math phanto274Cry phanto274Cry phanto274Cry
we aren’t watching the game btw phanto274Smile
u should do a run with worst possible one
HOW did people even figure this stuff out
one of life’s great mysteries darkapple
yes 👏 ur on see ya 👋 in a bit.
monadoShy monadoS  pls no more counting high
also it amuses me that the Run command is "Give in". "GIVE IN TO THE COWARDICE"
monadoS  im allready lost with counting
if you were to battle, does that increase the RNG by a known amount?
Hey there Phantom. Good luck on the runs./
aw man Charizard deserved to be lvl 100
i didn't know it been a hour
it was only a matter of time
it should always just read "Mom" for that one viewer, a la MySpace
I think my internet just died LUL
so you got a good espeon finally
No I got a NotLikeThis it was phantom
But it got the blue NotLikeThis
I'm debating what game to do for the multiworld
WW will be too fast and I'll get hard stuck instantly but idk if I wanna play vanilla terraria lol
well the stream cut out for me but hooray for a runnable mon?
do you do the badges out of order in platinum, the fen badge is 3rd but you dont get surf til after 5 badges in
yes, because telling people through your stream to refresh will ensure that they hear it :P
@chat if you panicBasket 'd the stream, refresh
the ghost gym was my 3rd one
Fantina is gym 3 in Platinum and 5 in DP
yeah looking a diamond speedrun they do fantina 5th
and platinum speedrun does it 3rd
okay so in DP her pokes are mid 30s and Plat they are mid 20s
still weird that it locks the surf which is way later, once you meet cythia's grandmother
oh man it's been years since I watched someone play Xenosaga. I don't really remember
college roommate played all of them right in the living room. Was probably too busy playing WoW, myself.
my first PS was PS3, so I never experienced them
maybe they will be remade at some point for Nintendo consoles? idk
but I am happy we got the Xenoblade series
the gd-flu hit me a month later
and god damn does it hurt
Ah no feel better soon Lai
today is the first ive felt human but its 100% the iv fluids making me feel like a person again
this is such a based game
i dont think ive ever 100% completed it tho, i got stuck and just gave up looool
Qui Be Nice To Us :c
2b in granblue has an alt costume for how she looks after self destructing
So ass out for all to see
ok all set so we got unlucky how?
so what's the worst case scenario?
so might need to take more steps?
okay so maybe i didnt suck at this game when i palyed it, i wonder if i got fucked over by rng
Death by Tippi, unironically a classic
I am using the kirby keyboard/mouse pad thing
Don't blame you, this run rng tests your patience a lot
Yeah past that fucking furret it's somewhat safe until the under
And after venus it's control+ F and search the fucking combination nascour uses
If you did hit a runable now you're one lucky bastard
I am not a speed runner, but all this rng stuff would keep me away from running this ever Kappa
@Schmueh rng can be addictive at times
Yeah, but I would get far too frustrated
Oh, great song from a great game
This reminds me, I still wanted to play the ttyd version of this game
I started, but honestly I am not amazing at this game and still went with hard
Honestly I remember watching you playing Minish Cap the first time I came here for some reason
I spent a week of my life replaying Persona 3
hands were busy but wow it’s been a year since Minish cap already Oldge
In other news I'm trying to eat this pack of siracha yakisoba noodles I bought but the spice is so weak that I've resorted to trying to spice it up
Oh yeah I guess buff00n is offering to drag me out to Midwest Speedfest so I'll be looking forward to that
I remember watching your run on the Japanese restream
Nothing wrong with playing the all time favs casually once in a while
I can literally play Cave Story at anytime in one sitting if you asked me to
I wanna stream the CS Rando
Haven't gotten around to setting up stuff for it
I am probably going to try for April, didn’t clue in I’d be away when this one starts lmao
how many games are supported these days
saw someone do a starcraft randomizer the other day... .was crazy lol
DK64 is also being worked on I think
i'd imagine it also has to do with minish cap's popularity
I will be heading to bed for tonight
Who were those toads you had to chase away Hmm
the multi-world thing is where you find something and it sends to someone else's game (potentially) right?
I'd like to learn Emerald but i'd say I have the most experience in pkmn crystal
its cool seeing the JP text
double dual income no kids huh
Black Ninja Koopa can't even have his bloody smoke break in peace
Looking at Archipelago and the only DKC game supported is 3 this is such a win for me specifically
Terraria is supported also a win for me
i learned what i already knew, that i need to practice area 3 and 4. because i again was green out of area 2, then boolossus and armory and weston
KEKW yea maybe i should use this knowledge of what i'm consistently bad at to practice effectively
casual rigby bop would be funny
yeah this is mostly just reading the fights
Just got here and an ad ia gonna start
even after just 2-3 runs the past few weeks my muscle memory has basically taken over for movement and the actual route, just fights are the issue now
forgot the start sprits also appeared in mario party 5
lopez is the only one right now at a high level
i used to watch this run back before we really had the neat any% tricks
i'm like 40% here for the music ;)
i put it for 10 mins maybe i should of put 30 mins
come on kids, gamba is good for you
if you go over 3:53, someone's getting paid OUT
yo raven ty for the gl
yo tiger ty for the gl
yo lopez ty for the gl
fine i will enter the fray
Yo lopez ty for the gl
C'mon Phantom, time to hustle that sub 3:53 and make me some pts ;)
I just had the weirded game crash ever doing emerald rando off line and I hadnt saved in over an hour
felt random, I was local recording so I can share it laterr
"Mario hates mushrooms. No, really." Peach (Movie)
Was gonna try different routing doing weather institute before meteor falls and the crash put me back to petalburg woods fight
I was excited too cause I fished a charmander with earthquake, drill peck, hyper beam, and poison tail phanto274Rage
I have a 69 ranked winstreak in kof rn
someone keeps trying to facetime me
lets start a call so i can bridge them and you can answer it on stream lol
:) I'm sure it's legal in most states
I am now at a 70 win streak Sadge
I could easily cause of ps4 lol
Hey man you came up with something
I mean as in colo being a dumbass
I cant be silent anymore but doin a rockin job so far. Me number is now shown.
that's ok, you'll get sub 3:53
well gamba wouldn't be fun if it were a sure thing
why is the Japanese version of a game speed run always faster
im gonna have to learn the berry locations. Im not expecting the tracker to be updated with those lol
plus im not marking the map tracker anyways, trying to get away from that
still would be nice to see map light up when its in logic
2 hrs reached oh forgot its a run. awsm
weird that emote didnt show on chat box
This is some strange looking pokemon lol what happened with that?
Sadge 2 hours?! Yikes I don't blame you playing something else then
not losing time a very good thing
Oh wow it's been a hot minute since I've heard this song lol
imagine a just chatting stream with 100% ads
lol. i bet they could do it
more likely the 100% ad stream would be of one of those hottub/sunbather streams
Lol him being dead but alive enough previously to accept mail 🤣
discord the only thing that ping me
twitch is really annoying with all of the ways it pings me lol
feel like i have to turn off a lot of the settings every month
love the aesthetic of this place
I can't 100 these fights yet like I can the others
I recently came across a fun question. "If you could make a PowerPoint presentation about any one topic, what would you pick?"
a powerpoint on why we don't like quizno subs
it is cool spinning movement reminds me of deku
ello phantom how's the run going?
phanto274GG phanto274GG popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS_HF popesPOGGERS popesPOGGERS marcoWin marcoWin tippiWin tippiWin marcoWin_HF marcoWin_HF a10cjWine a10cjWine
I hardly bet much I only put 10k I just wanted buff00n to lose his points
someone just paid for they vip LMAO
Didn't realize Raven was waging war in chat while they're playing lethal company
we got a q2 titan the run is good
@NSingman I never broke the bank so much. new family member.
@NSingman how many points did you get
i got my wager back by watching
Still beats my PB by a lot
this run only cost me 100K
Thanks for VIP @buff00n and Lopez
I had to spend 17k of my own hard earned points thank you very much
@blacktiger51 I'm eating taco bell rn
did you see my weird crash?
so what’s the stitch and menu?
OG gameboy chime threw me off
man 🧍‍♂️ do I feel like 👍 a million 💵
Yo chat, which is the best type of apple?
We're also talking about apples on their own so we can keep it fair
I wanna try a few more seeds first
also you could dnf if something come up
there are very few games on the list ive actually played
i wouldnt know how to set that stuff up and im lazy KEKW
1 day pape rando will be added COPIUM
Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Gala, and Honeycrisp
not gonna lie, when I was a kid I went to blockbuster and I had a choice between Mario RPG and Mario is Missing and I was so put off by the box art I went with Mario is Missing LUL
And to this day ive never played it KEKW
I think I rented Mario is missing once. I only remember being confused as heck as to what to do.
If someone voted for red delicious I'd have to kill them
i don't think i ever seen gameplay
ok 👌 poll is done ✅ lean green
Golden delicious and honeycrisp the only other ones with votes
but since it was an option honeycrisp way to go
why's Red Delicious called that when it's the opposite of delicious
but like u said apple cider 🍺 didn’t count
Yeah, we're counting apples on their own
No caramel or special coatings, not on the side of a meal, just on their own
I usually go for Gala or Honeycrisp
They sell the best by FAR
at one point, my gran bought nothing but Granny Smith, so I got a wee bit sick of 'em
Rave are just better and on sale when they're available
we like never dont have a sale going on for rave when we have them in season lol
I'll have to keep an eye out for Rave
This furret is really strong you should use him
Raven apples look like they came out of a cartoon
mod raven 🐦‍⬛ now an apple 🍎
let the run really rev up
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more.” Okay Phantom, I want to see how cultured you actually are. Who wrote this poem titled "The RavenFP"? Cheer100
People dont watch for pedestrians istg
Some jackass ran a red light at top speed and was a foot away from hitting me
so hype that you run this game! gl and hope you are well phanto274Bless
shows how little i know of the route
shadow Remoraid would just shoot 9mm at you from its mouth
gj taking out that deadly threat
The Pokemon Company was DESPERATE to make the Mantine and Remoraid connection stick
now we just pull out the safety memory card
what pokemon is that bottom middle
uh oh speedrun com moderators aren't going to like this submission
they're gonna kill you on the spot for the timer
it’s like a requirement for that to happen once every stream
This song makes me lose control ratJAMMIN
I see words on stream right now OpieOP
Phantom strim has a lot more jam emotes added
YOOOO i havent seen this game in forever
dont waste the nostalgia on a speedrun stream, go download the difficulty hack and play it yourself
oof sounds like a tough speedrun
the hgss rng manips are way worse you have to move your character the right way the whole run
Earthbound RNG manips like that too
damn alot goes into this huh
speedrun com mods wouldn't like that video of your cheating program
its only cheating if it defined so in the rules LUL
oh yeah they check a local vod?
Jugoomba asked in teambn and no one opposed
What's this trainer's class and name?
like whos gonna run bn4 anyways KEKW
Umbreon looks so hurt every time it takes damage
just realized that Wes never said if he did / didn't care about those goons kidnapping someone
If you start speedrunning Pokemon Colosseum you're admitting that you're in need of mental health help.
My area is more like a swamp
I've seem downfalls tagged as this on twitch
The further west you go the more it looks like this
I got 1 and a half mins of ads i aint hearing any of this
twitch has to tell me about the FRESH DOG FOOD FROM THE FARMER'S DOG
Does your dog get chicken pot pie filling from a plastic bag in the fridge phantom?
Twitch thinks I want to do that
my cat eats our dog's food
my cat will take whatever attention
said cat also won't hesitate to hop on top pf you
The feral cats outside will eat anything even straight up carbs it's wild.
Bro who gave miror b the bilinear filtering cut
bro ur makuhita just tried to attack a man
Shadow Lugia luckily spared everyone in the ship just to float in the ocean
makuhita was just off some stuff
if you didn't notice, the great ball was just duped
wdym he's ???? didn't you READ
DUKING looks like someone that drinks ROGUE ENERGY
is it bad i got a lg baja blast with my dinner?
That's a lot of sugar tiger. Make sure it's only an occasional treat
I believe ROGUE ENERGY might have sugar free flavors tho
you got any of them free shipping codes for the sample packs too or am I too late for that
i forgot how good baja blast is haven't had it for a long time
me gonna come watch in a min gonna lurk for now
bro when miror b said to carry a gun they didn't mean to carry a remoraid
he only got two arms tho
I guess that's still more than average Kappa
holy cow my stream delay is a lot, let me refresh
fave portion of the run time
entei went from sent out to dead
So what is the purpose of this part
plusle doin its job of wiping?
The cipher lab is so hype in XD
you get like 5 shadow pokemon
you picked up a WHAT from the computer lab?????
Cipher does WHAT? And you're taking SAMPLES?
that vigoroth is doin a pogChamp
you picked up a dna sample....
You caught croconaw having a shower?
or having some fun on the computers?
Amphorous is the perfect mix his Mega is a dragon.
yo phantom how goes the colo?
Shadow vibrava was an odd choice
genius sonority was based for it tho
getting crit by yourself for blaze blows
bro that dude is still using an uber
is that the dude from final fantasy 7
this is gonna be so rough.
what's gonna be the march run then
bro is about to speedrun i wanna be the boshy on stream
The sound for the UFO is the same sound for a shadow pokemon
Does monado just gift sub to everyone that enters chat
Sudowoodo has a nice shiny sprite
you already said this cant pb
pacer pals just unsubscribe, unfollower, cancel the rogue energy sour candy purchase....
can we get a micro review of the sour candy flavor
What does that "Tiger's blood" one taste like
Tigers blood used to be my flavor for snow cones
The Queen always makes me nervous
You hate venus but how you you feel about the pre-mixed rogue energy in cans?
there are exclusive flavors looks like
looking into jugoombas manips but cant get it so trying to make my own
ill be happy with just 2 lol
I have a vod I saved of him only chaining 3, but now he does 5
not even important enough to use boss music
Shadow tropius was a wild choice
why no banana flavored rogue energy huh
I woke up, watched the partner direct, saw Epic Mickey, turned it off, saw Mother 3 and didn't care
Epic Mickey all I needed to know
I have the epic Mickey game on wii 🤣
So whens the next pit run? Madge it's been a while
Sadge but I feel like watching pit runs
Curious as to what next months run is
Will it be a zelda game?
Nice ur doing a revenge runback
I think it's gonna be BN5 LUL
My sora amiibo arrived, everyone is here and on my shelf lol
its gonna be awhile to get used to but being filthy rich feels nice.
that comment by pallos was fine.
real tlak if I was that guy and someone took my pokemon I wouldn't send out another pokemon I'd pull out a gun
oh no come on guts this out
With having such a good quil tho you should save time in the long run right?
Ah ok so you'll need to get it to flame wheel asap then?
How do you know it's IVs?
It's going to be a beast later on tho
i think mirez here skipped leg day
dude has like a 12 pack somehow
Would you try get quil in blaze now?
wait nevermind I see red numbers.
Pacer pals, cancel your order of a rogue energy "waifu cup" shaker
Now that im back from the ad break for the 8k oled TVs can you say that again
let's see how good the plusle is
we all set now. Crisis have been overted.
it can hit itself in confusion into Blaze
With the remaster of epic mickey I went back and watch a game dev interview on the wii release and what a treat that was.
i'm mad that i got monkey paw'd
i've been wanting another rare game on N64 NSO... and we got one! and it was fuckin BLAST CORPS
My sister had it, enjoyed my time but didn't play much of it
Did I just afk a bruh moment
Camera control wii be so nice
epic mickey is based and a reason to install dolphin and rip a real copy of epic mickey you got yourself
the real wii exclusive that needs a port is zack and wiki quest for barbados treasure
All I know about the direct is epic mickey and mother3, I slept in after past night lol
I've had an injected mother 3 on my 3ds for years and showing it to people through streetpass
yeah it's like a Royal or Golden for it, now that i've finally seen seen concrete details
so no transferring save data but you CAN transfer demons from your compendium. 3 of them.
Is that a smt 5 follow up?
so you can get vengenace and play the original storyline (Canon of Creation) or the new route (Canon of Vengeance)
both of which are said to be 80 hours, and you choose which route at the start
Canon of Cringe is a Persona title
you can now also save anywhere and the level cap is now 150
they're also tweaking a few things in the original storyline to touch them up which is nice
oh also they shadowdropped Penny's Big Breakaway so that's nice
That's by the sonic mania devs
How many shadows do you catch?
also of all games to get a switch version, i never expected Pocket Card Jockey lmfao
I had a feeling something gamefreak would be there
My water bottle is gdq branded and says silly stuff like rng pause buffer sub pixel death warp and damage boost LUL
Love getting a add second u respond
i like the way they all padded out the door of time.
monadoLove  we are here to support uuu
Quil got exp earlier than normal due to it purify so if you need to give espeon exp share earlier in Mt then should equal out better
AWW SPHEAL IS SO CUTE IN THIS GAME
I give rng to random crit him
has next months game been announsed yet
is it hello kitty roller rescue phanto274Lurk
yay i have my spooon back
We shall dance to the top Quickly with experience in toe
awww taking my spoon off me
sorry had to go get Yoshi lol
SA2 was good, lost another PB paced run to Bofa skip (not a ligma)
you break bofa da boxes and clip out of bounds LUL
I've been here a while but I ran a kof ft10 so I was unable to type for like an hour
they are really cool at least Hero Story imo
well people who can actually play the game well lmao (not me )
Hero story is like the only run I ever hear people doin
"running" lol I am trying to learn but it's like learning 3 games at once bc of the variety of skills each of the characters use
there's something like 500 different emerald locations (100 ish per level)
ye I did have a short VGC stent LUL
I also caught a straight up wild Charcadet in my violet playthrough with 6 perfect IVs drtoadWiggle
some odds like it's 4 times more likely to win the powerball or some shit
YEP and I wasted my good RNG in a casual pokemon game vs any speedrun ever LUL
granted I believe I still have the only recorded 10 cap (no dodgemaster) hallway boweser fight lmao
human machamp we meet again. Give us all ur power we need it!
Woah what I miss?! Somethings gone right
I saw the first few fights on Mt battle but then on phone 🥴 glad you stuck it out with this run
I think I like Pyrite just a little better because of the theme but the Under is very cool
It’s tough to beat. rough that the lab comes after this pepeW
Heyo, I know I'm hella late. How goes the run?
I checked. The evolution line is based off the honey badger
Yikes. Mainline games would be harder if that were the case lol
this typhosion be flexin' on them
Cynthia just pops out Spiritomb and Garchomp next time. Fun times
Like the level 29 ludicolo 😬
Has the physical/special split happened in this game? I forget when it came out
Man this place has a lot of battles
Oooo I see a pretty fair run going
All this Typhlosion does is hit fire blasts
The sweat is running on my face now
What was the point of that?
@gyroguy123 that would be pachirisu and emolga along with deddenne deddene is only 1 i like though
How did they screw that up so badly lol
This game feels like an enormous test of patience lol
Should be easy with that Plusle
At least you don't lose money when you lose, right?
Just haven't been seeing any payout messages, so I just assumed it wasn't happening lol
Flareon has drizzle ans starts with thunder, you can make this shit up lol
reminder that all these animations are STOLEN soul from the stadium games
and it wasnt even a prank bruh
Wait, no Miror B theme? 0/10 fight
looks like i just beat persona 3 remake
1/6? Only a 16.5% chance then
Not healing Typhlosion to keep it in Blaze?
Because AI sees a kill and targets with both mons more often than not
So you just solo the other mon and protect on Typh every other turn?
What type is your Hidden Power?
Oh right I was confusing that with damp
whoa wtf I never knew that
I’ve never beat the end of this game to know the major is a fake homie
this game is killer like that
but I'm pretty sure you can for Evice
nascour you have to face the whole tournament agian
The defense buff wasn't introduced in this gen, right?
Damn... Rough ending cause of Evice
back just for the end of adge
I am just speechless u crawled back.
only thing that would be better is if it had a better purify nature imo
thats about as good as you can get for first split LOL
my reath and ferma is currently at 1:01 i think
red are bad nature green are runnable with the right amount of calls, and pink is to farm on natu
every nature that can happen to
I take bow wow on an adventure everyday, it's called walking other people's dogs for a living
Oh boy! I'm so hungry I can eat a Gordo!
You killed my dog you asshole
Taking Link on an adventure instead
Link's life would be so much easier if he could just eat Ganon
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE HERO OF HYRULE
I would play ToTK if Link behaved like this the whole time
Very interesting sprites you got going on
The sprite of Bow Wow fishing back there was incredible
Link finally understands that he can just slurp half of Ganon's minions
I can’t even keep track of what’s happening in this room
The dog failed to tame the boy
heheheeh u are the bowwow so cute
Wdym?  I think it's normal for link to be in a dungeon
It's normal for link to act like a dog on a leash
you don't leave Hyrule for some... Dream.  And the worst part, he's bringing his courage down with him.
took me a second to realize you're controlling the chain chomp
why is mario chomp on this dragon quest game
which of these two chomps eat the cake faster was the peak mario party minigame
dang, I forgot how disorienting the bowow sprite sheet is when you're not expecting it
are those POKEYS from PAPER MARIO CHAPTER 2?
ok wtf is going on? HUH
is this regular good boy mode or swordless?
good boy mode logic is a bit janky, I think the crystals get removed because he logically counts as a sword
I think daid has said that he can eat cutscenes sometimes
i keep getting mindfucked by the sprite swap
can you add flying items in dungeons to the rando?
if i want to redeem a rando do i need to give you a seed or smth?
Betty Botter bought some butter But she said the butter’s bitter If I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter But a bit of better butter will make my batter better So ‘twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter. Okay Phantom, its your turn now. Cheer100
LADX Rando and maybe Emerald? Just do Archipelago and do both easy
frik i thought seed redeem was 25k… oh well
is the next game called the legend of bow wow?
You should be able to beat it
i wanted you to do a keysanity dungeon full shuffle
i wanted to shuffle the entrances as well
Wait wtf are you bow wow
cool thing dropped last night. Banjo Tooie AP V0.3 Alpha. Tooie is better suited for rando cause all the worlds are connected and some checks need later abilities so its loosely a 3D platformer metroidvania
I was watching a video on its world design and thought "this would make a great rando" and 20 minutes before I joined the channel that release was dropped.
Also icebound was credited for help with it too
Have the seashells ever lead to anything required?
oh I didn't see that one yet.
I did see the animals are in animal village one though. XD
also there is a rando out for it already but its more of a ram hack hack than a rom hack so it wont work on everdrive
i just ch3cked out the clip, very ominous.
I am now following DK64Speedruns on twitch
DK64 is peak gamer mental illness
you've lost the plot once you start playin' that
wait you're playing as the chain chomp?
I thought u were zelda just flopping around helplessly
Phantom "best sprites in the game" 5800
getting too good, time for some decoupled ER
Bow Wow died to save his dog, what a good owner
Didnt know link was into being a pet
shuffled or randomized bosses? can we pray for oops-all-slime-eels?
what rando do you enjoy more between this and minish?
I doubt that many played minish, just feels like a zelda most slept on
that guy was like, "whats a bitrate?" LUL
a container of watermelon ranges from $7 to $14 but a 1/3 of a watermelon sells for $5 and some change
do people hate cutting the rind that much???
1 heart? damn, that's rough buddy
I think skipping the first one is a TAS trick, yeah
doing pretty good, just got home from work phanto274Smile  how are you?
guessing you adding banned stuff to this now
at long last my pent up energy from the race is expelled. now to enjoy a rando
need the health and thx 4 warning
never seen a rando for this game nice
which dungeons do you have left
can do like 2 dungeons now lol
I only played this once lol
so are this chests within dungeons spread out in the overworld too
oh okay I was thinking that would be way too difficult to keep track
the lore to this game is so crazy
like when I first beat I felt like the villain waking up the wind fish
I was waiting for the twist at the end but you just wake up ALONE the end gerbieWAH
never knew you could take their helmets off lmao
do you know what the “extra” dungeon they added in DX is?
if you get level 2 item first then level 1 will it regress?
Hmm where is this in vanilla lol
gonna have to go back and try it out
never really occurred to me that D5 has both the worst boss and miniboss, neat
took me so long to figure out how to fight these
oh this boss have to be there?
hey its your fav boss fight
oh i should of turn on the setting on where u can switch the tunic anywhere whoops
my mum was VERY confused about the Octorok plush on your bed
she didn't know what it was
ooh, I like the change to the chat font
how long has that been there
think there a super jump for it
well certainly the richest seed ever
want to know where other sword is?
at Koholint Prairie - Witch Item (Sphere 13)
what did you think of the settings?
nice go on the sub 3 afterall
will you be down for another seed soon but where u start with x heart and you lose 1 every time u beat a boss
Ive watched a whole bunch of the rando VODs and love it so figured it was time
ive played vanilla PM so much its time for me to play MQ and some rando. Looks like it makes the game so much fun
just maybe a little bit lol.
rando glitch logic gear shuffle coinsanity upgrade shuffle no boots no hammer Kappa
Rando's just breathe so much life into old games. Makes you do things differently than vanilla playthroughs, and some things you can't do in vanilla
it really does. makes it fresh and new
If I wasn't doing 69 things at the same time, I would
I wish I had a device to play rando ResidentSleeper
is artifact out of logic too?
I have a 8 year old MacBook and a switch LUL
I did right at the start of stream
I wasn't sure if it should be in the channel or DM
ill have to switch back to the old version lol
the jelly pop kinda looks like a japanese dumpling lol
wow... you can go evrwherre but 6
we all just hate goombario eh?
up to u on the half grind. just use a timer still
Hmm I can't even think. Have you played it recently?
i thought you had 2 tubbas
everyone is trying to coerce it out lol
Devastating run last week such a good quil phanto274Cry
Ah just when my time to resub is 🙃
at least 5 is one scaled lol
my favourite chapter isn't available though... sadge
i think it wants you to go to chapter 1 lol
it is chapter 1 so maybe no
just drop my yaml in #sub-chat?
it would be cool if you could shuffle the badges amoung the gyms, like norman has heat, watson has mind, ect.
in version 2 beta waking kyorge sends rayquaza to sootopolis so it speeds that up
yeah, ive done it just so im familiar with it but it wasnt required
so far locking norman behind 6 has been a good change not making me fight him early.
wanna know what happened last night?
I forgot that GBi isnt on my serial port and had to switch to slot B LUL
but I have a GBi folder that was empty on my serial port so thats why I was going crazy
could the 3 blocks by koopa village have something or no?
water could be in ch 7 monkaW
one rando i got required me to go to Dark koopas at level 1.
peach looks like a goth lo
vanilla I love 7 just for music selection
dinner is what im doing atm
you guys also getting very mild weather? its been a weird winter here
ours has been +10 some days, and then -20 the next.
it's my friday and i got off early .. so very good, i hope yours is too!
seed wants you to be Thor with that hammer lol
What? I thought 2 was off the table
Hi! Long time no twitch. I've caught a bunch of your YT videos
i like the red sushi skin
ive never been able to avoid the dizzy
is chat not working on the screen ?
@buff00n Chat got Bopped and banned
i just got a second one
i wanted a high refresh rate so i repurposed my old one as secondary
why is miracle water out of logic?
hour in no star spirit ouch
how the badges treating you so far
any of them too extreme for worth
do you only need two seeds for blitz?
i prefer it when he has macho grubba skin
i forget which mod it was but a friend and me discovered a mod for pape 64 that stacked quake power quake and mega quake badges and when you had all 3 equipped it did 12 damage always
im guessing all flip tiles didnt get randomized
it would be funny if the quake badges did stack
this is a bad flower fields
that toads head looked like a shroom cake
it had the same pinkish color as the shroom cake
yeah it was going ok up until the usual points, difference is this time i've practiced
so idk its gotta just be nerves now
what are you missing right now, or is the tracker accurate KEKWait
i  dont know why but me and my friends always call the gulpits quagsires probably because they look like it
what is the purpose of blue key?
going to go back for your cake shooting star or just get better items
peepoIgnore "yo shadow pass the blunt" shadowSmokingWeed
its been forever since ive played
magikoopa saw you destroy the clubba and said F this im outta here
Nah fuck you ill watch instead
this looks english to me lol
im not a glitch person, so i would never notice
talk about a metric buttload of star points
Buttsbot isn't in here I must do their role
Yea I can se you're missing goombario
no hes not, hes just ignoring it
If they cause their own downfall that's on them
Go back and do it more
ive been trying to figure out the best one
how do you get the rando ROM on N64?
ive been playing Rando on Wii U VC
i like one of the 5 people that own a wii u lol
ours was bought launch day with mario U bundle
Or the strictly worse version of 3d world
Do you wanna go slower in the same game
wait the wii u version is slower?
You can go oob in wii u tho
one of the harder games IMO
gotta love it when star rod doesnt even work for him lol
hes dead and he doesnt even know it
I just had a good idea and am mad I didn't implement it months ago
my first attempt was 1 frame earrly lol
start it right away or wait til march?
i was eating pasta when you went live
Got some 811 and now Im chillin
I used to but have been early less often as of late
@stavros12c34anenoglou just cut the HELL outta my finger on the clock
well I should say 15 minutes, I started a little befor eyou went live
If you didn't lose that time at the end, you wouldn't be playing today phanto274Smile
Just need God tier quil again
doing good, found a mario puzzle at the mall earlier so doing that lol
I finally finished a 1000 piece among us puzzle... well not exactly finished it. It was missing 7 pieces and had 13 duplicates 🤣
It was awful 🤣 did my head in trying to get it done only to get that 🙃 haven't touched another puzzle since.
Normally love doing puzzles 😔 have a couple mario/luigi ones and yoda ones left to do
I want the tootsie roll now
How have you been liking Colosseum
Not that you'll be doing it much longer
I missed the frame and hit the power button
Darn we cant count out crits
You should always give 69 a chance
Imagine just walking around it and going about your business
I can see why they bagged her up she always in the way
Exactly. When I played this I tried to get her stuck on the stairs wherever I went
had no idea this had a speedrun :)
I'm looking forward to some more rogue arriving soon. I bought their sour candy one since it was sold out last time
@DrBarber88 never will have the tongue for it
is that because of how random it is?
have you ever had circus peanuts?
circus peanuts are orange marshmallow candy
A run out of reset hell, interesting
Balanced all the way until like nascour or adming refights
OK nvm balanced the whole run
What's the issue of pyrite Colo again? Is it a roselia?
Oh well now it makes more sense
circus peanuts (imo) taste like cream soda, if the cream part was more marshmallow-ish  I think they're underrated.
since i'm pretty sure no one actually owns the candy, you see them in many forms at most gas station generic candy sections
Swift, youll vouch for me right?
it's "ewPokemon" with the pepe meme
beg phantom for a free sub KEKW
marcoCry_HF avarie1Cry minimi6Cry phanto274Cry tippiCry marcoCry
i caught the end of that one run in my delirium and defo didn’t expect that plot twist
I have double pneumonia atm so life is hard
rng in this seems like absolute hell
No bad time only good time gminus1Angy gminus1Mad
dear pkmn colosseum community: we should use a modified version that has only masterballs - kthx
this manip reminds me of why i don't speedrun pkmn in general
make sure you wiggle your left big toe left to right during the manip or it won't work
just such a rough go at it tonite but we will conquer through.
I thought for sure I just now got but turns out if you go 4 frames early there is another naughty nature LUL
I think you should just always have it ready
idk how you do this kinda manip, i'd be so adhd and wouldn't focus well enough lol
im doin alright how about you liamkComfy
just one more it's fine, just one more I swear it'll be this time-
do you think Wes is a femboy when he's chillin
what nature do you typically go for for Umby?
oh it goes by ID? Neat
I'm getting my horny ass beat by a boss rn
Have to hit tight movement for like 5m cause this fish got too much health
this is the first time I've been able to really sit down and actively watch 😔
hour in... what happened? Miror B?
I had to deal with honse rng this weekend 😩 I got one (1) with Spacial Rend
Apparently RNG is 1/10 for Spacial Rend so it tracks but I want my vengeance on honse
how many frames does colo run on again
megaaEyebrows that is some evil split shit
i mean they're named pls sub - what better advertising could you go for ;)
had good progress to stone badgee
its not, for first starting out id be okay with 3 mudkip attempts per run
