Did you come back to Let's Go cuz of PokePark?
Hey can you give me version exclusives :)
You should also play on spanish or something
you like gen 3 tho, no?
Jesse got very mad at my retweets last night
I retweeted the same spinarak picture about 100 times
I did, you've signed up jameikKneel
just running some fusion rando while waiting for pizza
are you perhaps interested in doing commentary for some of the races?
I still need to just throw together a layout so I can run something
check out the volunteer form when you have time
yo haven't catch a stream from you for a year
@blacktiger51 buff00n timed out blacktiger51 for 23 seconds.
Dude fuck getting your wisdom teeth taken out
how many channel points to time out buff00n for 23 seconds? Kappa
I'll timeout anyone you want for a gift sub. KEKW
i am broke or i prob would
im on mobile so no sub
I love buying a new friend at the hospital
how the fuck do i have 10k points already
i didn't know jessie and james was in this game
you can just bring out a 2nd pokemon whenever u want?
just need gravity suit and i'm go mode for this run
It's nice to be able to spend my points again now that I'm not saving up for VIP. KEKW
I think that you mean Sasspras.
rock tunnel looks pretty easy without flash
I mean, we can make rock tunnel an issue. Do it actually blind.
my eyes got really heavy during ttyd cchapter 2 LUL
remember all the time as a kid playing blue and doing it without flash
i couldnt find my video cables so running component on retrotink 2x pro. It looks passable for now until i find my video cable
is every pkmn game a pain to run, or just the ones you've run?
I found a preorder for the BN special edition. I want it but I dont 125 bucks want it
safe to say, i can clear a fusion rando in less than 2 hours so far
you can get the glasses seperate for 45 bucks for whats thats worth
i wouldn't pay 125 for that
Hey Phantom! Good luck on your run phanto274GL phanto274Mash
iceblue said he is getting it tho
....... why the Hell would someone throw a 5th grader on a shot/whiskey glass ?? ? ? ? ?
lol, ingame time was 1 hour 11 minutes
would have been much more if i had gone for 100%
pokemon centers are free cause your parents have to sign up for a pokemon health insurance policy
@Axl_SR nah pokemon centers are free cuz it base of Canada health care
MWSF just announced that they're leaving 2dcon
Yea 2dcon just gave them a room
They still got the one in april that's zelda themed in MN but idk if mwsf will stay in the state
but what about the futbol there
and no one outside of cafe's has other league channels here
so i camt even watch english soccer
oh nice got the sub anyways i guess
I want that struck from the minutes
she was older than me when she debuted, I'll say that
She's 17 early on in the first series, but is later noted as 20.
It's okay buff00n, you're safe to fawn over Jessie.
the older PKMN ladies speak to me

way more fun than doing either of those things on its own
and i made it to ch6 so that's really good progress
is there a chance james wont poison you ?
it's only like 30% but it happens SO OFTEN
i swear it's not actually 30
i was gonna say that fucker's the size of the whole ass grip
I've never caught a pokemon Lets go stream. yay. (: gl on the run!
i couldn't see it on stream too well but that sounds really nice for ppl with bigger hands
are you catching every pokemon in this run too?
I might have stupid questions during this run, since I've never seen this game run before. lol. just so you're aware.
Pallos still has not found a shiny
phantom did you know he's STILL hunting ghiratina
Oh fuck I forgot that you were live
I was gonna raid you lolol
splash will find his way here anyways dw
About 3 1/2 hours and no Giratina
Its been over a year :)
Ohrocks got it full odds in 2 days
you can definitely just not play bdsp
I modded mine to make it not dp
So I technically didn't play it
i haven't touched BDSP since i streamed it when it came out
I did it in like 60 FGRs and I was slow at resetting cause I was half asleep when I was doing them
Why play bdsp when you can play bdsm? KEKW
Fuck no they don't have you seen pokemon artists
why play bdsm when you can catch 'em all
or like, roughly 400 of em
In terms of actually catching them I prefer how it is now
wasn't carnivine in both swsh and pla?
Did they put him in swsh?
I hate pla so that doesn't count for me
I remember looking through serebii when I was teambuilding for the casual playthrough and that bitch wasn't there
Hisuian Voltorb was a blessing from GameFreak
phantom 1 sub for taking care of that message
for me, legends arceus is still the most fun pokemon game i've played recently. i liked scarlet/violet, but something about legends arceus keeps me coming back
i swear it was in the base game but i just checked the pokedex to see if i was lying and i was
if it wasn't in gen 8 at all then i just got mega mandelaed
holy shit maybe it was just pla
dude i think i just popped into another universe
I would never mistake my carnivine knowledge
hey m4 is hidden trage in ch6 right before machine?
"stupid pokemon" - every pokemon fan for like 5 generations now
Hes going to get moles at costco
PhantomGamesBot: @mx_four this looks like consent to me
remember how in the manga, lorelei was a member of team rocket?
they on the throat goat tier
@RuneRavenFP Yo wanna go to costco together
i didn't see you trigger it that time
I need a hot bot in my area to take me to costco
I don't regret saying that for the timeout
hot @PhantomGamesBot s in your area
so i forget, what do you need 50 pokemon for again?
thank god that's not in firered lol
I didn't even know the bot could have a sub. l0l
y'know, I always thought back then that Kangaskhan was ground type
best we can do is another golbat
so long story short, I've had covid for a couple days, and the most annoying thing about it is not being able to taste or smell. I just want food.
i think the game wants you to ride onix
maybe you can build a harness
Onix is more obnoxious to run into cause they're so big.
if you go chain 5 growlithes you can get a persian
welcome to Lavender Town (aka creepypasta city)
as long as you also didn't just blip from an alternate universe it's probably there
im not seeing it on pokeearth
greatest emote ever? i made mxfourHi for free
the internet said that town does
meanwhile eevee just clicks bouncy bubble
does anyone here have a scyther they want to trade?
that ace trainer considered it tho for a second
I realized that you are in a speedrun
Yeah that's why Maddi sets her game cat to Arceus or Scarvi
i have never seen someone realize that after asking before
sorry but I don't speak English
once i had someone come in, ask me for a trade, i told them i was speedrunning
they came in again and asked me what shiny i was hunting
I forgot Blue takes u to town for a little fun during the game. I should play Eevee
i was like. bro spot check lmao
I think I'm just very fondly nostalgic for the music. The fact that you can't curveball makes me sad as a Pokego player tho
i might have to get this game at some point looks better then  violet
I was dubious at first too with Violet but it's solidly fun
:^) What a wonderful children's game
there's something funny about watching your rival get booli'd rather than the rival booli'ing you
I think Nemona may be my new fave. Miror B if you count him and Silver are still top tier tho
thinking is hard for the bisexuals, let them LIVE
I didn't mind Hop, but he could do for a few cutscene chops
If they had left Scarvi in the oven to cook a lil longer, I defs would have liked them more for sure
I am bad at the following
I love that oddish planter back there
I'm the freak that looks at little details
what's your plan for the rest of the night after this run?
I'm a vapid lesbian u cannot sell me on Thurrs. T
does that take from a pool or is it just that one
wait i wanna speedrun that game too
well now I want to see how shitty it is
IT'S A MEGA MAN 3 HACK???
ok maybe not SPEEDRUN but it seems short enough
the walkthrough is about 45 mins long
it's even more dank than i expected
over here watching boondocks and thought how funny it would be to have a reset notification of Riley saying "quit crying you little bitch" KEKW
Oh god that poor Starmie LOL
I'm fucked up now whenever I see berries as fruit in the Pokeverse cause like. Strawberries and tomatoes and shit exist. But here's Gina Mommy monchin on Razz and Oran berries.
NO PROBABLY NOT CAUSE THERE'S TOMATOES, AND THEN THERES TAMATO BERRIES
I think their extra taste profile is bitter, but it's been a while
I'm a fucking NERD and a FREAK who wikidives Pokemon for fun
it's so funny to me to think that those swimmers are those guards and they can't give them any place to stand. Nope. Water only. Get your laps in bro
@dustpan2112 I can do this all day
Bro I love not having to play the game
I hope they keep changing things so I don't have to
if these rng rewards actually worked, this would be THE worst seed
He knows where shit is anyways
Axl that would mean a pape player made this
It shields you from spiked enemies :)
There's so many to worry about
its confusing seeing big and tiny partners
so where would the checks be for merlows son?
It'd be boring as shit for a race
Spoiler log is cool because of routing on short notice and this is just a worse version of that
Does that mean the bigger points mean the more key items potentially? Like for example, toad town and chapter 5 being around 60 points
if toad down has like 10 items how will it fit on the tracker?
What in hell am I looking at
rooPog  ayo that actually sounds pretty interesting
THAT'S why Spike Shield is there Kappa
so Dry Dry Outpost is like irrelevant?
Why did they use watt for chapter 4 instead of a shyguy
that would seem like you could get a v speedy run with this
I think it's based on the spoiler log, which does count these 2 as forest
if you get a sub 2:30 are you saving it as your PB KEKW
Imagine going fast playing the game when you can go fast and not check half of it
yeah, but Dmg Dodge is, like, strictly worse than Def+
Damage dodge is a top tier badge
oh, i didnt think of manipping HP
The only issue I see with this is the emblem for prologue isn't  Prologue
Imagine a tracker that lets you skip half the game
A little scared about what required item is in Palace... you may need to go there sooner rather than later
@blacktiger51 this is the new race settings
tracker's in development and it's already in races? huh
wow this is an incredible eyesore
I do like how the start of rando was challenge runners begging ice to add masochist bullshit settings and now people want to skip everything
Kent had a grape otter pop it looks like
what the heckity shmecity is this mr strimmer peepoArrive
for the rest of stream you should pretend this is the tracker you've always used whenever someone asks
@Puffy78 This is my new favorite entrance message
Heyo Phantom, what's different this time
Mega jump that's on the tracker
so wait this tracker is based on item locations? intresting
how did bn3 multi world go?
Oh the tracker actually tracks things like KH2's auto tracker now? Neato
Yea phantom NO EARLY BIKE THIS TIME
I dont even guess anymore on this shit
This minigame refuses to let me win
holy crap is that McDonalds Quizmo
buy the thing next to the letter
oh boy what am i looking at?
You're gonna have no good badges
well, if you've never won a race, it'll help you out Kappa
so im gonna go out on a limb and say this tracker mayyy not be allowed for most races YEP
so it kind of guides you were to go?
Feeling fine being on the tracker is so unbelievably comical though
imagine jcog doing this and everyone asking what this is LUL
Send the code to jcog and see
I personally don't use the points mode with the KH2 randomizer's tracker, I only track for how many items are in each world in that game
Racers don't have access to spoiler anyway
spoiler log actually gets unlocked once you collect goombario + all Fx badges Chatting
Hey Phantom! How's it going today? phanto274BLANKIES
how do you mark chapter scaling?
I dont think a casual tracker would care about it
is there a reason to mark the badges?
are the badges equal points or are some weighted more heavily?
No berries but you do have 6 access and Laki, Hmm
and im assuming normal items are nothing
junk key items to throw off the scale
I mean, it couldn't be more than 3 since you've seen it
so ch7 only has a required item. the badge should be 2 points to keep you guessing if chpater 7 has a required item or a misc item and a badge
Get it out of the way while it's still worth XP
if im doing a co-op then sure im fine with hints. But to me hints are such a turn off
so how you feel about this
desert having nothing at all is interesting
it looks like the kh2 tracker fr
Are there 2 Yellow Berries on the tracker?
phantom explained this to me before he started, "I dont want to try this." Now that ive seen him do it "I really dont want to do this LUL "
@iAmKrisXx thanks for the gifted sub
honestly the interesting thing to me is just figuring out the possibilities of what each chap holds
yoooo thanks for the sub phanto274Love
yoinked the whole thing and placed it in Pape
my plane is in 7 hours
i am on my way back
get ready to be destroyed in park
they should have kept the icons imo
Phantom didn't settle for 10th like a nerd
ill hire a hitmen to bop you off the board
debating whether or not I wanna be happy, or try returning to 3dw
still more useful than feeling fine :)
ngl i dont even know the name of that badge
Its been like a year and a half since I said "sub 1:40 soon" COPIUM
can you mark off items you handed in, like frying pan?
oh god this is going to be an absolute clusterfuck once you hit go mode
oh yeah, you could just check your items to see if you handed it in
it's gonna look like a mess
Cause the people who made this
Start at level 15 when they play
So they don't care about the levels not being right lol
new stream challenge, find X item in the tracker once we hit go mode
Gotta be level 20 at least my b
sigh I know who made this lol
I can't play this game at high levels off the bat
real men only upgrade the best stat: HP
i need my mario to struggle a bit
Mario is so cute when he struggles
like I dont mean to be that guy that saying you cant play the way you want but WHAT THE FUCK!?!
beach is always stacked beach is never not stacked
maybe once there's exp multipliers they'll back down on that
icebound said they wanted to add a one hit ko option
If it's not you should move it, if it is you'll just have to remember either way
Phantom I'm gonna have to show you how I've got my layout setup when I finish it
It's pretty rancid but it's doing the job
Schrodinger's yellow berry, is it in Flower Fields, or in Jade Jungle?
what up phantom. Run been good so far?
but I'll check the tracker in the discord
how does cake work, like if cakemix is in boos mansion and koopa village which do you mark?
Instead of dragging the icons, it could be that you first click on a section your checking and any icon you click after it gets added to the section.
is antiguy and buzzar on the tracker too KEKW
tbf outpost has a misc key which could give you access to a required item
the tracker makes this fast to play out lol
Well, there are some good badges lol
i could see myself using this for co-op randos
i cant tell if i would like this more or less without the point values
Kooper's Shell - basically guaranteed worthless
listen the fact that prologue has stuff for sure (unless its somehow 4 badges) gives me hope for a goomba king fight WhatsHisFace
Technically it could be actually nothing bc Artifact is also Koopa Village
ya, this tracker needs some personalize-able badge options deathf1Thinking
I mean, you could just edit the code for yourself lol
and also for all Fx Badge randos lol
use channel points to redeem "make phantom use this tracker"
completely unsure about berries and cake mix, never got that explained when watching Spike earlier
ya, that's the part that never got explained
they did say letters were not point though
Spike is still playing the seed right?
glitchless rando = less glitches not no glitches
chapters 3 5 6 and 7 iirc
all 7 of his stars are lit up
S-s-something different?!? Well, if you say so. Hey hey.
Spike was a big proponent in OoT 5 dungeon
so similar vibes from 4 spirits
What the firecracker is happening with your tracker?
oot have warps songs and you can hess everywhere
i really wish pape had something similar to warp songs
without using homeward shroom how long would it take from tubba's room to crystal kings room?
Spike is certainly a character. Great human being.
oot also has like glitch warps and shit for travel its just kinda cool
oh man thats an interesting idea
pape races but its literally racing from one part of the map to another
So, if I'm reading this right.. Watt based checks and progression unlocks have a really high value of important items?
I mean, it's a TAS anyway, why bother with rules
why use a shyguy when watt is there :)
So, Chapter 4 is stacked. Got it.
"Because I don't care anymore" hmm
idk why a Shy guy isn't there
Yea they only use the boss for like 3 of them
Why not boss for all of them
ugh...still testing positive for covid...I NEED TO WORK!!
Yeah. The Watt over Shyguy threw me off.
Kris I'm sorry to hear that
Merlow probably includes Star Haven shop
is Merlow just Star Summit in general
youd think for fortress it would be a koopa bro if it has tubbas heart. It just lacks consistency
There is a lot of inconsistency with the tracker icons, yeah.
koopa bros with the pointing stance, to be very different from Kooper
Phantom like time to break the ge
missed the streams where have you been?
what how did i miss that
twas a fun stream of pikachu resests lol
did you skip over the Lets go part?
need a 3rd hand to keep up with the dragging
is slow go on the tracker Kappa
hell I didn't know Slow go existed till the rando
volcano could've been that pogplant sprite at least, maaan
trying to find the cool ones
the readme mentions that supreme chose most of the icons so I'm not sure they'll change
yeah I feel its a little much in this game
Yeah. This is definitely cheating. KEKW "Prioritize going here".
I dont wanna PLAY this shit
I guess it's good for learning the rando?
it could be cool to have some kind of hint to know an area is barren but its a bit much
the fun in pape races is seeing everyone split up
you might as well be reading the spoiler logs at this point
I tried the points mode in the KH2 randomizer once and when I found out it did this as well, I wasn't a fan of it either, so I get the sentiment. However, as a feature I think it's at least newbie friendly.
Oh for sure. Totally agree, but for someone that gets easily lost/doesn't know every item off by heart.
Map tracker probably works better for new players tbh
Like, actually reading the spoiler log and routing it to be optimal?
Spoiler log you get like 20m to route and it's cool
Whenever I see WW races do it the routes split based on player level it's always neat to see
spoiler log race but a week of prep
They did one that had a day of prep once that was an allsanity
oh btw, spoiler log overhaul inc soon. incl move costs etc
like yall I hope yall did the homework
Everything for your stream on bit . do/fVRFL
Can we get a two player co-op rando where one player is blindfolded, and is actually playing the rando, and the other person is on call with them with the spoiler log but can only communicate with a set list of vocal commands.
But he had to go o7
did you see jcog added the tricks to race settings?
I didn't even see what it said
tbf for this whole thing, it's intended for very casual players to have faster seeds w/o actually reading the log
@VikiHexen if they are blindfolded how can they see the log?
Phantom I finally did it I have a layout now
If that's the intent, I can see that being a plus
It's as rancidly put together as my pre-glenn one but it looks good enough
you dont have to worry about that, its still on the github lol
Once it's more available, you'll probably want to discuss banning it
whats the zero on the key for?
spike is aiming for around 3hr seeds using this, on lvl 15 start, 4 spirits seeds
wasn't power jump badge found in jungle tho? or was that not a badge in the list
Hey we should make laki faster for that room
today he got to star haven at 4 hours, I kinda wonder if they speedy spin
I got a sub 3:30 once and that was on paperaces LMAO
how are you guys beating this game in under 4 hours
Yeah my first rando seed was like 8 hours, my second one took ~5hr
yeah I got better at each seed
i'm at around 4 hours rn too
yet you always beat jcog lol
I like the bot going huh
some people can be better at routing
oh, that reminds me. i used a weekly race of yours for timing a sample run down to what actually took how much time. for science. i can post it on discord if you want to see that breakdown
i'd love to do fusion rando with people
cause i've been practicing fusion rando a lot
that shy guy is the bane of my existence
wish I was better at it
fusion rando does sounds cool too bad i don't know the game very well
i can do a seed in about an hour and a half
could you put it in and see?
You already saw a Bubble Berry somewhere else, right?
I think it was on the beach?
quizmo  being red is disturbing me
id want this tracker to have d down jump if i used it
can you make it give you negative points?
i got into bowser with 15HP, unblock claw puts me at 6, fresh, unblock flame then im peril. Feeling fine would ruin my strats
If I pelt popcorn chicken hard enough at my screen, do you think a couple might make it through to you? KEKWait
@blacktiger51 I got a regional this weekend so I've been actually playing fighting games for a change
i'll have to try it out sometime
3 of the points for a fucking smiley face
I wish I could fuck bowser as hard as feeling fine does
M4, do you know how to build it?
no slow go but you put feeling fine?
the tracker is on github, so youd have to build it rn
there's no way someone in the race community did this
yeah i don't know how to build hsit
Phantom could probably just give you the tracker from his
i have a lot of stuff to do for pape races
bc nobody else is willing to touch beginner routes
i hate looking at it, but at the same time I wanna see M4's reaction
dude i thought "so i'm doing a tas rando" was a random bot vomit
until axl made it show up again
This is basically taking a rando and making it out to be base game again. If you think about it, this really is just playing the normal run but with things shuffled around and then none of that matters because you have a set path anyways.
this is so weird and definitely cheating
Hey Monado guess what emote we have fresh
is this your first rando w/it
I can't stick around though, one of my dogs got a dental today and she's in a bit of discomfort so I'm gonna spend some time with her. Good luck with the rest of the rando <3
so you got bored and started cheating in UNDER 80 minutes
Give the doggie 3 pats on the head for me
this is truly a time of all time
But with a more reasonable tracker. KEKW
im mad about danger mario not being worth points but the smily face is
i will not get over that
It takes away so much of the mystery.
I love how this whole stream is just shitting on it
i mean it's a cool idea for... not us
we are not the target audience
It's cool enough for learning but it's not gonna be a standard
lmao the divide over this. spike's chat was happy there is finally a "hint system", and in here people are flabbergasted
i still think danger mario should be worth points
Are we the elitist assholes? KEKW
only if we start arguing it is bad
this isn't objectively bad im mostly just confused
absolutely! always catches me off guard how different people outside of the rando discord see the rando
also if they wanted a hint system,
Well spike is also playing the rando starting out at super high level, completely different style of playthrough already
there is literally a vanilla one
oh "elitist asshole" I thought you said "elitist Axl" KEKW
yeah you know who it's directed for really
it's not quite this robust but im surprised they felt the need
If we are the elitist assholes I'd be very okay with how wholesome this community is phanto274Shrug
If you find a single badge, you can skip to the end
ddown jump that badge is bad that's no mega jump there
Mega jump is all the damage you need
@mx_four Put a smiley face on it maybe it'll be good
look as long as it increases my atk by 2 while im in danger we are good
I guess you haven't seen Cake Mix?
Cake mix is lost in the wild
so according to this tracker, badges are required for progression?
tbh though i do think this idea is cool
it just seems. outta touch with what the rando community is interested in is all
but yknow, not the target audience and all that
what's the inside joke on feeling fine?
then again, maybe we are out of touch, tunnel visioning
it's not rly an inside joke - the badge is just really bad. status is very rare and it also reduces the duration of helpful things like repel gels
Goombario was like the first thing we saw
oh that's something I didn't know actually! if it's cheap I usually equip it actually, it's good to know
If they toned it down to JUST the chapters as a whole, then it might be okay, honestly. That way it does give you an idea of where to go, but it's still fairly vague. Like.. Only have Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 listed. Not all of these smaller categories.
it doesn't come up much haha
i think there there also was discussion of getting this tracker auto-tracking
yeah :) repel lasts exactly 2 turns
unless you have the funny face on
I would love for you to read my above message, if it's not too much trouble.
That moment when you start a rando and see that toybox has 90+ points in it. o _o
I was in Haggs stream this morning and he said he does have interest in picking up pape but wishes the community was larger.
Does Goombario has a value in the tracker? If it does, doesn't it skew the value of the section he is in?
Goombario should be worth 50 imo
I have noticed that the bot likes adding lol to everything in recent times. I'm scared. It's gonna say some really effed up stuff one day, and then just go lol
The bot saying lol so much is powerful
He needs to keep doing it
well it DID just talk about choice band meowscarada
The bot has gotten significantly less horny though
He was down BAD for a while
ok gl getting sub 2 hours with your cheating device
i gotta do pape races stuff
dude i have to do all bosses without clippy
Can we all try to get the bot to go through an angsty "But mooooooom" teenager phase?
Getting sub-2 in a game with an hour of cutscenes YEP
ive been assigned to practice saves
if you would really like to help maybe you can do the beginner route for  a sample run
but i gotta make sure it works first
omg, pink Watt is beautiful. I haven't checked out PMR in a while.
i assume this is not on the table for channel point rando seed redemption
you should be doing the expert route with dizzy shell instead
both of those would've maxed dizzy shell no question
that 3rd one also probably would have lmao
I am never killing children again now
True I forgot about the yoshis
can you sushie glitch to skip jr?
it looks like a Jynx KEKW
gotta bounce, hf on the rest ig
There is no buff00n to get banned so I have no gifts to give
your tracker I can glace at how many ruins keys I have, but this I have to look over the whole tracker AND count them
isn't it also 4 different tabs of items?
The item here could also be a Fortress Key
each tab was the different point values, so one for 9, one for 7, etc
Ends up being blue key lmao
Did you determine that no minor items can be needed anymore?
Rune why you pin that rofl
So desert village is done? Minor item and badge makes 8
Okay. The process of yeeting popcorn chicken at you until one goes through has begun.
someone asked, what was the first game you got day 1. My first game was BCC KEKW
what a let down that was
I feel like I've read before that. it does actually protect against freezing even though it doesn't note that there
"surely" after bn3 it could only get better, right?
So are Tubba keys the only things you care about now?
They added so many more enemy colors and partner colors since I played
Quickly now, switch back to the regular tracker. No one will know.
Let's hope all 3 tubba keys are in the ruins
Ice King? More like..... Coal King gottem
To be fair, I'm pretty sure this boss hates you too.
His little buddies looked like coal
Who even is he, and why does he hate us?
Here is what you do, finish this run then tomorrow stream the vod with your tracker over it. Cheer100
so is he part of a union?
crystal king really is the only character with like no context to him lol
Yeah, that's a good point. We have backstory on a fair amount of other bosses, but like NOTHING on him
I feel like crystal king is just character quota
Crystal King! I knew Ice King didn't sound right, lol. My brain is not working today
theres no bowser going "grrr why the fuck didnt crystal king win" or something at the end
Ice boss go brr. Get it? KEKW
thank you for suffering thru this so we dont have to
Cheating is fair game in paper mario rando
Isnt this guy immune to like all status?
ngl i'd find it entertaining watching experienced racers do a "cheating" race
I remember using Shrink Stop on him in my vanilla playthrough.
No, Tutankoopa did not equip FeelingFine
At least you got life shrooms to buy at toad town
be kind of interesting to see who would go where
@YamiKuroya Spoiler log races are a regular thing in zelda randos
They get like 20 minutes before the run to look at the log and do a makeshift route
So what Toad Town items have you not turned in?
did you buy the calc from boo shop
Woah new tracker looks confusing, then again I'm not too familiar with speedruns
ooooh that makes sense for zelda, the games are so big
and yeah i could see that, phantom, i'd just be curious where/if people would split off
Since I'm busy eating, thank you for saying what was in my brain, Phantom.
I guess you already turned in Dictionary then?
I mean it doesn't take much work for a TAS being a bot
new tracker? i find it confusing?
I mean a castle key could be in the castle now
I figured it would be in castle
Did you return dictionary and pan?
so if zero that means that section (like get bombette to get parakarry) has nothing left for progression? if i understand riight
you probably get a lot of questions
but i was at work and could not join at the start, sorry
You didn't miss the Sushie check or anything, right?
ah ok, so start, toad town, tunnels, sss, koopa village, fortress etc
Ah, so the characters/items symbolize areas
Last Tubba Key is in Tunnels, Flower Fields, Tubba's Castle
i can see how this point system can be helpful to the runner but it's harder for viewers to understand. with the old one i could easily tell what you had/didn't have and if you were Go for a chapter
Seems interesting on paper, could help with memory' basically what abootoo said
you can tell from the start which areas have a lot of progression items, and later which ones still have any, makes it harder to miss something...
It's not bad per se and I could see it being used but the other one was in my opinion (and seemingly everyone else's) better
Okay, so explain this new tracker thing involving points.
is one item = one point, or are different items valued differently
so Jungle has one misc key item
And so, among different people. Whoever gets the most points on their playthrough, is the winner?
Oh so there's kind of a math thing involved too, neat. I think I could have fun with that honestly because I'm a nerd and if it makes my brain work, it's good 8D
Oh, so right now, next to the Watt symbol, there are 5 checks to find?
The bot said he's doing a TAS rando twice, can't be a coincidence. We're gonna hold him to that
watt = all of chapter 4
So like a single misc key item
it's tough to tell which partners you have. it's in the tracker tho but i have to look carefully
So the points are basically hints on what's locked there.
So, what's in the star summit?
cant believe you probably gonna beat your pb by cheating
is merlow including star haven shop though?
Probably lots of random stuff in Star Haven shop
so tunnels is either 2 misc key items, or 1 required item + 1 badge
What's go mode? Heard the phrase, and I think I may have asked this before
I had my 3rd Tubba Castle key in the SAME spot just 2 seeds ago.
have all items needed to complete the game
A key, but not THE key.
Tubba's castle is kinda gross dude needs to clean up
What kinda spiders live in those webs
hammer and boots anywhere next seed?
The term 'what' is an emote what the heck
What is tubba's diet besides ghosts
No boots and hammer to start, yeah. I was about to ask for that too.
I mean realistically they could be scuttlebugs
i will be down for that @VikiHexen
Ah. They're spider-like enemies but I think that was contextually obvious
Sciuttlebugs are the red spider guys in hazey maze cave
Hammerless is one thing, but Bootsless is in another ballpark.
You can do gearless when they patch in saving
Well they're different looking now but yea
i feel like Goombario being valued higher than a required item is a crime
What about bootless but you get hammer? : D
They're purple and yellow striped nowadays. Yeah Goombario should be -1 point
It would screw up stuff too which would be amusing
slow go should also be -1 point
NSMB Wii, Sticker Star, I think origami king
They were in the pyramid I believe
Neither do I tbh, except the final area and how Mario brutalized the final bosses
64's my favorite of them, while I'm at it TTYD is overrated (but still good)
SPM is also overrated and it's good but ever since SPM Paper Mario games haven't been the same
I liked Super Pape bc I'm a platformer player lol
I was so excited for Origami King, and then all of the bosses were school supplies. FeelsPencilMan
i have fond memories of both 64 and TTYD
I disliked super pape because I'm hyper picky with my platformers
i thought spm had a good story but the rest of it i could take or leave
The ideas were cool but I just don't like how it plays
Where does tubba run off to lol
If I had a nickel for every time bowser Jr was canonically cut into pieces by scissors I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice
Buy a million Life Shrooms YEP
I don't know how I feel about being lvl 7
Always wondered why bowser didn't use the Star rod to just kill Mario once things got rough
this would be much simpler with 50 fp
Aaaaand the bot is on crack again.
I mean yeah but he's not stupid like Dimentio, Bowser should know when to stop messing around
@x_the_g00n_x he kinda did in the prologue. the star spirits brought Mario back to life
When the last time we had Bowser get serious
yeah Mario kinda died in the beginning
I think Odyssey counts, even though the scenario and his form of combat was incredibly goofy
Bowser was pretty serious in odyssey
do I count Bowsers Fury eh
He surely wanted to marry the Wife
Well the scenario was pretty normal just not sure why Bowser had to use the hat. Should have ditched it after the first fight
Bowser deserves peach more than mario
Bowser still deserves Peach to this day
there's at least one more blue berry in there
Nah Bowser was SERIOUS in Odyssey now that I think of the fact that he hired a frickin dragon I mean where'd he get it
I thought we had established that
Bowser can do better than peach tbh, she's useless as both a character and a ruler
..... i wonder if it also has peach's castle too now
Also lied about the cake in SM64, she doesn't even own an oven smh
im p sure turtles are dragons :)
Needs to spend less money on castle renovations and more on an army
yeah that would make sense lol
21 still just seems so high though
Either included with Bowser or excluded entirely
my country agrees w you, g00n
well Bowser Inside Story and SMRPG he had a legit army
two badges and a misc key item then, makes sense
In SPM and Galaxy we can see she has armed guards
She has Toads, they're just... Toads...
ah so it's telling you what items or points or something are possible in each location?
every single one of them toads useless
And seriously she treats Mario like crap sometimes, like TTYD she pulls him out of his personal life to hunt treasure for her.
And tried to leave him stranded on the moon with bowser in odyssey
my man only has 15 fp
is she a 'you dont have a choice' kinda ruler?
help me hunt this treasure! or 12 years dungeon, 7 years no trial
I mean Mario could say no if he wasn't a damn simp
I'd like to see her arrest Mario tbh
Peach has good PR then - i never pegged saw her as a dictator, but mb she is
Hopefully peach will be better in the movie
If you lose you know what to blame
Send it to jcog for science
you did skip ch1 and ch 5
not much faster? isn't this basically a pb your very first run?
This fight is gonna be so slow
this is like someone in chat with the log saying, "there is nothing in the desert, dont go there"
Desert dead yall don't go there
whats with the stripe in the sky
just this Final Bowser gonna be rough
that's the sun, axl - but you might wanna get your reflexes checked
I have never seen this much lightning
nvm triple heal fiht, triple lightning fight
Bowser played his magic card... RAIGEKI!!!
and they say lightning doesnt strike twice...
I mean it didn't strike twice
Bowser REALLY doesn't wnat you PBing.
Also no quick change in that tracker
I understand peril strats not being casual but quickchange is busted no matter the context
why is Quick Change not on there
this is THE most scuffed Final Bowser
I feel a WEE bit responsible
Time to start a new seed?
time to start a new seed
those Bad RNGs came in clutch
I bring bad luck, i'm sorry
any% bowser strats but in randfo
woke up to see the bot doesn't make sense.
can you do the next with this tracker? so i can see how it works from the start. thanks
Why the devil is 'what' an emoji.
@abootoo I have a feeling that would be an unpopular decision
do you think this tracker contributes to not being prepared enough?
I also want this tracker, but I think I'll wait for the Youtube video
34k points until I am a VIP.
Just to find out how it works
I feel this tracker took in account of having high lvls
What do you play on, hardware or emulator?
Ah. Never had one but I'd love to play modded games on it
Is this the same seed or nah? Sorry if ya said this already, I was performing job-related activities
feels like over half of that is just in ch 7 and 8
now imagine it's TTYD, the length is tripled, and you ahve to mash the text lmaoo
mansion cutscene first time entering that screen too
Plus when the 6 Boos come in there to hold the door.
Plus all of the Tubba Blubba stuff.
plus how long the two boo minigames are
train as well, but that's minor
mayor and bucket and scarf cutscenes are so long
I never did until now either XD
One of them was only 10 coins though.
Ah now I can look at the bottom corner of the stream
I love how he sells you his own missing Calculator.
Just as soon as you mentioned the weight not being meaningful...
It slides into your key items.
Why do you say that? It gives you access to the whole Boo's Shop.
I put in a suggestion for the Whale to have randomized colors, like the other NPCs in the game.
Oh, it seems Fuzzipede doesn't have randomized colors either...
Do npcs like merlon and whacka have colors
I would like to suggest color filters that you can put over the seed. Like.. Sepia filter.
No, the ones the Lava Piranha buds spit out on the second half of the boss fight.
I found the Red Yoshi Kid letter in one of these trees on my last seed. And I had just rescued him around the Whale scene. So it was perfect timing.
I mean.. just turn on the other tracker and find out. KEKW
I've had them at 2BP on 4 seeds.
Oh, you're using Balanced Random. I use Fully Random for the BP amounts.
ok what the fuck is this
well i guess this is a star piece seed
i noticed the other day that every partner had unique dialouge in rando for approaching Boo's Mansion for the first time. Nice they added that in.
Welp, I gotta go, guys. See y'all later!
A front loaded seed 20 minutes in??? I take it Goombario is somewhere safe where he can't be forced on you
honestly giving fice t the letter like that feels like saying "you know that ghost you just saw?  it wants to GET YOU it told me so right here"
we are a non-zero part of why that toad has nightmares
Early Super boots seems like a lot to me
poor sushie, just being tossed like a ragdoll
Saving yoshis? monkaS I still have nightmares the time they gave Goombario
that one weekly race seed phanto274Smile
I'd be down to watch that and probably ask some questions.
i know i would be interested for learning some of the tricks
my rando went Godawfully, but I enjoyed the experience
Same here. Take in all I could learn
as I'm just starting and learning
can you teach us English raph skip?
Ok boot up the practice rom I wanna see it
i will show u English raph skip with laki  Kappa
random question, is there a TTYD randomizer?
ah, so nothing like this one
How do I tell my baby brother that he is not immune to the cold grip of inevitable death
I mean I told him he just doesn't believe me
just have him watch all dogs go to heaven
fun fact, ive got a 102 fever and just tested positive for covid
I had the 3DS growing up. I'm too young to hate this generation but I hate this generation
what's your star piece count at?
I missed Miiverse when it got took down but looking back, Nintendo took too long to kill that monstrosity
Now that we bring that up, wonder how hard it would be to track star pieces and coins and stuff
surprised they didn't bring Miiverse to the Switch
Yeah it was cool but it was also the social media equivalent of adding voice chat to SMM2 Online
Damn why's the bot advertising his discord
Woah pink gourmet guy! He reminds me of my brother (the self-proclaimed immortal one)
Just had a Sundae, I don't think I like cool whip anymore it's like a saucy marshmallow
my household is a "canned whipped cream" canned whipped cream or riot
I'm a cool whip guy. loooooove cool whip.
Some places put age restrictions on canned cool whip
phantom this tracker sucks can you cheat again
It's like candy corn you can only have like 2 bites before your stomach dies
Whacka has some sexy tears made of stone
If anyone can name the 3 types of rocks without looking it up I'll eat my headphones
minecraft blocks haha thats all i know
I'll eat my AirPods cause that's funny
@x_the_g00n_x igneous metamorphic sedimentary. boom, hs chemistry teacher'd
Did not think there would be a teacher here
WAIT IS THAT THE JOB FROM BREAKING BAD XUSNFHANCHK
how do you think i could speedrun the game cause i cant really record as i play on the wii
I agree with black tiger. MORE CHEATING!!
Well guess I gotta eat my headphones
i worked in industry a bit then xfered to ap chem teacher
you mean you GET to eat your headphones
@x_the_g00n_x thats truly unfortunate hope they taste good tho
no offense, but i hope they dont
There he is. I knew it was too good to be true LUL
Congrats. This seed is now doomed and cursed
One of these days whackas gonna flip his shit
@x_the_g00n_x If you've ever heard of dark star or masterquest, whacka does in fact, lose his shit.
Lord of the Sith Goombario wants first hammer to be deep Sadge
doesn't he flip out og game too if you hit him enough
...... why do i have memories of him getting really mad and attacking you from my childhood then omg
He has an unused battle sequence
I think in dark star, he has 999hp. lol. and does a shit ton of damage.
whacka gets abused too much D:
I'm guessing btw. that's a complete guess. lol
Back. Watched the master quest battle
Honestly I love the concept of him being OP and fighting back if ya hit him too much. Wish they would have done that as opposed to' condoning animal abuse I guess?
Looked nowhere as hard as Koopa Koot though
Such is the evil power of Darth Goombidious
Every. Single. Time. Goombario is found and the seed is doomed and cursed LUL
What has Goombario done to this seed? LUL
This may as well be a blue key seed at this rate phanto274Shrug
maybe it the rando just telling you not to cheat like last seed again phanto274Shrug
this seed is something else. lol
Rip Cheeto is not Santa LUL
and the last check is power rush Kappa
It's a shame you turned in the frying pan. You could have made some fresh egg omelette with Jr.
Anyway yeah all you gotta do is drag Jr to the kitchen
That aside; yikes the in-video subtitles'll make any word an emote won't it
Or won't they, too tired for grammar
we can beat chapter 4 now Kappa
wonder if there's something in the storeroom.
i was gonna redeem it after u was done drinking
its gonna be vanilla red key this seed
we wanted to see the 40 second cutscene
'There is nothing more cringe than using the word cringe' -John Cena, probably
Yoooo dodge master now you can dodge easier!!!!!!1! (I am funny please laugh)
I just learned a kurki stun/tod combo
Woah I didn't know the hammers got colors too
is it even possible to hit these guys with a tornado jump
I feel like I've had it work literally never
Ah wish I woulda known that. I've always been awful at power bounce for my playthrough
you run pokemon park, dont think I dont see you
How when you wii waggle you dont slam your arm into your desk?
I thought I was the only person who knew pokepark existed
ive hit my hand 4 times playing DK Returns LUL
Ya that's partially why I brought it up, wish I could have been there tbh
Donkey Kong Country is a series without flaw
As long as you ignore potential flaws
I hate they made running a power up
We need a new Wario Land that's what we need
@x_the_g00n_x or play the 3DS version
DKC can be excused for absence since it has a damn good soundtrack to keep up with. Pizza Tower seems cool but has a notable lack of Wario which is a killing point for me
the level design is top notch
best donkey kong game is dkc2
yeah weegee, phantom needs to finish at least 1 seed today KEKW
Is the tracker automatic or manual
What's an AntonBlast I'm uncultured as frick
do you own a copy of donkey kong county 2?
Pain is fun when strangers laugh at your misfortune on the internet
rip i was gonna say put it on the wheel
there is no tracker for fusion rando. well there is, but it's just items
Still I hope Warioware doesn't end up being the only Wario Series
if only there was a way to cut the cutscenes
that is... more than I thought
we're not counting tiny things like loading zones right?
so everytime we do a run can we take off 40 minutes
does menus count give Gguy cake?
i have seen jcog get fp plus in like the 1st couple checks and he check the cost as soon as he get it in a race
Y'know if ya put that on last run, bowser woulda died
i've pretty much determined that without special tricks, the first 10 minutes of a fusion rando is about the same
blue key check lets go Kappa
i forget sometimes that prologue goes off chapter 1 scale
this literal sick looking Goomba King
that sort of "I need to swap partners anyway, let's do it in battle" seems like the sorta thing that gets you minimum menus
PhantomGamesBot edges closer and closer towards coherent sentences
still I don't think many people would even think to optimize that
This is also one of my favorites songs
How many checks are in volcano w/o hammer? 3?
If Blue Key check is Red Key you did the fight for nothing
It's better if Red Key is not in that one specific location... which in this case it was
Oh my I'm growing a beard help me
just switch the room to jp
kooper: "I found a bunch of explosives in there!"
actually @MarioManTAW have a better idea
There technically would be precedent for removing the room (shortened ch8) or having it be open (volcano escape)
the real answer is import the JP maps already so we can use the glitch
an option to turn the doop fights off is something i agree with but not getting rid of them some people may use them for sommmme extra exp
I like it too, its just weird
delete Kolarado, remove him from the game
Back from the dead what did I miss
we need kolarado to move not talk
i hope the last tubba key is here
rawk hawk gives me an excuse to bust out my hercule voice
Some guy was trying to tell me that there's a film better than The Mask (1994)
have a good night, thanks for the stream
Auto emote bugs the hell outta me for some reason
How did he pump blood without his heart
I'm no biologist but I play enough medic in TF2 to know that you don't remove the heart without replacing it for enlarged primate organs
Yeah but like uh, why didn't bowser keep the heart with him I wonder
Not gonna say bowsers the smartest guy so I'll let it slide
I mean his heart doesn't look like it can pump anything to be fair
My moneys on the Star Rod personally
did u ever bought the last item from rip?
Q: Does he yield? A.) No  B.) Yes  C.) He Does Not  D.) He Does
its 7 am ill head to sleep have a good one everyone
lets see if bowser will be cooperative
How long have you been running pm?
Oh that's more recent than I thought
you didn't use your cheating tool this seed so bowser is nice
we don't talk about that jokehoWalk
No reason that shouldn't hit watt except she's made of plasma
How does Mario resist the power, he's inhumanly heroic
I don't care much for let's go but I'll try and stop by, stay hydrated
are you talking to someone? They're low af
Nintendo needs to stop fuckin around and throw Prime Trilogy on Switch
i never beat Metroid prime 2 i would like to play it again
last time i show u was live is when u was playing rune factory and that was a long time ago
this mailman's my dude: complete instigator
i saw it and was confused
You wouldnt time me out right
someone's modding Robin into UMvC3 for some reason
he is a runner for the category pleases the virtual character
I'd give bad rng more often, but in the event that a really good pace dies cuz of rng, I feel like the runner will hunt me down
alright i opened a third time
@SeventyFourTG who are you? who is the streamer,?why am i here?
Hi. I want to offer promotion of your channel, viewers, followers, views, chat bots. The price is lower than any competitor, the quality is guaranteed to be the best. Auto-on. Incredibly flexible and convenient order management panel, everything is in your hands, turn it on/off/customize. Go to dogehype dot com
whatever succeeds the Switch, it needs some fuckin horsepower
doesn't need horsepower that compares to PS5 or Series X, it just needs more than the Switch
cuz recent Switch games have been chugging
I'm glad I haven't missed splat yet
i wasn't saying it was hard
it's a good thing this game was well made to beaten without important items
I don't want a game with a sword
@buff00n tbf it does have an upgrade
because they have too much time on their hands
i just got back did i miss anything
that why the timer says 12 mins lmao
if 👋🐸 you 👋🐸 get 👋🐸 an 👋🐸 email 👋🐸 saying 👋🐸 hot 👋🐸 wavefrog 👋🐸 slut 👋🐸 gets 👋🐸 fucked 👋🐸 by 👋🐸 ampibious 👋🐸 dont 👋🐸 open 👋🐸 it 👋🐸 its 👋🐸 a 👋🐸 virus 👋🐸 that 👋🐸 puts 👋🐸 wavefrogs 👋🐸 between 👋🐸 all 👋🐸 your 👋🐸 words 👋🐸 I 👋🐸 fell 👋🐸 for 👋🐸 it 👋🐸 again
not a fan of Wario's absence
Is there a particular run timer app that you all prefer? not looking for like splits tracker or anything, just basic timer
that 1 glitch i haven't seen before
haven't watch a speed run for this for awhile
last time i seen 1 is after someone found barrier skip and the hover to get to the final boss
last time i played this game i did the boss key skip in the Earth Temple i hate that stupid place
i like all of the dungeons in this game, none of them are annoying to go through for me
they have a goombario pfp on NSO
the rest of the dungeons are great
I think the expansion pack is worth it for Goombario
it was way before item slide was found
i wish i still had my wii u the new glitches looks fun
I will order Little sNeeder's pizza
Opened up my old Gamecube today and found a dust bunny inside
what is robin doing in your gamecube
moving to my new house lmao
@mvd731 should we rent a car again?
too good i told you this
mega lives close to us so, we might not have to lmao
idk who tf is coming to level up lmao
is it you and buffoon only?
so 4 of us, cley also lives with me so like, we have options
renting might just be easier lol, shouldnt be a lot
@buff00n renting prob idea, venue is like 20 minutes from the house, ubers arent too expensive but for the sake of convenience our own car would be better prob
also, everyone message me dates of when you arrive and all that
can i get a birthday shoutout for my brother luke
i've had it open actually but i didn't type anything
good job on the world record
yeah, I'mma need this on YouTube asap
I forgot how much I like Twix bars
the pb twix bars are goat'd
PLEASE show off the hidden rooms in Forever Forest
I legit didn't know about that until I played on stream
Forest and Desert paths would be very appreciated
i just didn't know how to find the 1st hidden room for the forest without a map until you pointed out the big ass rock lmao
it's the year of the Bunny. I need more bunny suit Lucina on my timeline
there is 1 trick i have no idea how to do but it is a glitch trick
can i get a luigi skip tutorial
I just need to stop running into enemies in Toad Town Tunnels lol
you’ll never learn how to do it now
look at how much time you wasted doing that trick KEKW
yea comparatively this laki jump sucks
once you told me about the momentum, I havent missed it since
Aw nuts I missed some, I’ll rewatch what I missed later
Yea but it looks cool thats whats important
tell that to laki artifact jump
omg thats how I get past that shyguy omg
can that fly guy still reach you if you in the wall?
i miss this movement after playing ttyd
ttyd makes you appreciate the pm64 things you take for granted
is Phantom being a teacher today?
one thing worth noting but doesnt apply to race settings, if you break the block by the save block before coming here the 3 blocks here will be solved.
is this, ruins, and tubba table the only laki jumps?
when will you be showing reverse goomba king im setting an alarm
i find this easier then the other way
i just walk into the wall til i get it lol
i thought you said this would be a long video
Teach me how to play Paper Mario plz. Kappa
i have 0 idea on the movement to get out homeward shroom is op
"first, we need to talk about parallel universes"
In order to better understand this trick, we have to talk about "the void"
A glitch that works on English only? That's rare.
I didn't know that actually. That's kinda cool.
Hello, and welcome to boundary break

Is this gonna be a youtube vid?
Have you showed everyone the Goombario strats yet? Kappa
Yea those dark koopas are brutal for me here haha
thank you FeelsBadMan no notches yet but soon

I mean the puff isnt much better, but the bee is the worst
I do in fact bait both of these lol
I need to watch this again
I barely get past bubba lol
I feel like thats super fragile
i'm gonna have to rewatch this later on youtube lol, i got here super late
just got here a couple minutes ago, but I'm thinking!!
fingers crossed the trick i was hoping for is in there phanto274Smile
I'll be happy with any time saves lol
its lenght of spin i fuck up
oh man, that's a rough one.
Since I took off emu it's been night and day difference
you have to know where to be
my consistency is awful with that one but ive hit it a few times
I'll have to check back after the YouTube vid
I joined a little late, did you cover sewer spiny room?
Can you show Tubbas Spike Room?
Think they might ever incorporate coach races?
my biggest trouble is the drone hallway in tubba's
cause yeah, every time i try to do the spin cancel method, i get caught
Bow-less Tubba Castle made me better at doing full spins
oh i meant where the capture things are, the things that take you to the entrance
@MarioManTAW its what taught me full spins too lol
are there any visual / audio cues we might be able to use help with the hallway?  just for if you aren't used to the timing
oooooh that's great to know, thank you!
you said youre gonna do a seed after this?
I'm also back from eating. and I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
I'd love to see you do some bosses haha
like during the seed is cool
fun fact, i no longer need a map for metroid fusion rando
I just wanna see how you menu tbh xD
if you don't mind + didn't do it earlier, i'd appreciate if you could even quickly do the water spout puzzle (i know it's less of a room and more of a trick so)
would you do a part 2 eventually? I'd like to run a rando and come up with some questions
say less, because i struggle with huff n puff constantly
Phantom being a chill teacher today
I mustve just gotten up my bad haha
oooooh fantastic!  i missed the very beginning, so very excited for that youtube vid
omg thats way faster xD say less haha
all this stuff is gonna be much easier once i get my everdrive
I appreciate it haha, I mustve gotten up right during that part haha
likely i'll be using a standard n64 controller
what made you wanna do teaching today?
Can you explain how you decide what to check next during a seed?
He saw some of my hot garbage tech this week xD
well I forsure really appreicate it, already gave me some nice time saves
oh!  i just remembered asdfjkl; do you know if the practice rom also works on emulators too?
I did see Pape popping off last night
so you know how i said fusion rando starts are always the same for the first 10 minutes? not so much if you get morphball as first item
excellent, i have two different emulators, so it'll have to work on one
morphball first item means just go straight to sectors
why do we even have to get back the star rod, can't bowser keep it /jk
That Goombario Skip was clean. First try.
kooper, you really couldnt look around? he must need glasses
already lost. I hate this game.
Hii phantom and chat! How's the teaching going
I've been a sub for 6 months, and that's the first time I've seen someone get it right.
i feel like i won the lottery, just without the money
might as well get an extra 5 star pieces for close call?
doing another seed, got VERY early screw attack
i would immediately forget what i item i picked up lol
I didn't know you can do that
i will say, after watching enough rando vids i can hear when you get items vs. badges
OH that makes a ton of sense actually, I thought it was either or for logic with the cake
Is it faster to pick up items by hammering them?
when you say anti-guy is in logic, as in you might have to fight anti-guy?
I'm so glad youre saying all this, because like this is what all my hand notes say, it makes me feel like im thinkming through logic correctly
OH I was so curious about that
one of those ruins keys you got from a hidden block though right?
how much does a higher/lower chapter increase/decrease the HP? like +1/-1 kinda thing?
Theres a couple of spreadsheets out there too, I always have one open
The stream loaded on first try
I didnt know you could jump on those button tbh
is there a benefit to doing the slots?
so also just like real life, gotcha
oh got ch 7 ch 4 ?oof
oh wait what made this out of logic? I mightve missed it
her fan smack can come in handy at times
ah i see, the more you know
expensive badges and expensive bombette is part for the course
i hear that badge is great for bowser
that thing should subtract 3 points on the tracker
no the other thing too though
oh yo we're on the randomizer now?
2 > 4 > 5 > 3 or whatever it's trying to route you to do lol
That badge did save me once against the dark koopas when I had absolutely nothing else lol
thinking about starting my first randomizer, recommended settings?
Besides N64, what is the best way to play?
Retroarch with mupen core as well
bizhawk mupen is best emu way
I only use 64 on Donk
oh rando doesn't even work on project64
64 never gave me issues, but I've never tried a rando
it especially doesn't work on Windows 11
is Mupen better than VC versions?
merlow's rewards don't work on project64, so you can softlock seeds
nah you can still softlock since you can't turn merlow's rewards off entirely so :'D
even tho OOT and MM randos work on VC
if the wrong item is on merlow, you're just sol
i've not had issues with using ares for rando but i also am p new to doing seeds so lol how good am i really, who knows-
Collect Goombario, this seed becomes unplayable. Just sayin'.
No weight an hour in hurts my soul every time
does tubbas heart have colors? Feel like that wouldn't be too hard to make colors for.
Fun Fact: Clubbas are unable to enter loading zones because they are biologically programmed to fear the unknown
explains why tubba fears death after having his heart taken out
Phantom I forget if I asked you this but do you like french fries
yeah I think I did ask that
lmao it was the scenic route
is this fast video game man?
this is the content I'm here to see
What technique you use for fast tapping?
i got my wish late and it feels bad
I see myself coming back to this and wishing I've asked something I neglected to ask here
inb4 4th key on Slow Go
But its almost 10 I doubt I can stay for the whole thing as much as I'd love to
Anti guy was easy in my vanilla playthrough
Only real difficulty I had was with General Guy, uhh Final Master fight, and Kent
Pretty sure only one of those would be fought here
Can wreck you if he gets the time, but he doesn't always get the time
Only issue with me starting a rando is that I'm not a speedrunner so I'd need to learn the skips n whatnot, and my attention span is too low to play through in one sitting
only 1 and half hours left
Why not going for the Ultra Boots check? Do you only need Odd Key?
what are the rest of them in rando, vanilla or repeat of the last?
Good, no condoning whacka abuse c:
halfway towards a rando seed lets gooo
the world record for most wild corvids inside a domestic household at one time is 9
Hey Phantom! Hope you've had a good night, and good luck! Wish I could've been here for the full lesson
that's good, cause I'm trying to get better at randos
it's currently taking me like 6 hours and idk why str9ngSadge
how do you line that up?
I didn't see you were doing this stream until just now. very cool
i'll for sure watch this back. i'm still doing my first run and its taking me a WHILE lol
My first rando was 7 hours I think lol
Imagine getting 4 capped on huff
I got my first star spirit at like hour 6 and then knocked out a few quick.
for standard race settings how long do runs take on average? obvs understanding variance
that's buckwild for all 7 stars lol
is it ever worth grinding levels early? or do you just expect to get them passively
right you're just hoping to kill things before they even get a chance to hit you
awww no mega rush, nevermind LUL
ah shit i miss the rando
guess i will catch this 1 on youtube
do you have other defensive badges on? last stand and what else
Did you enjoy my crusty ass windwaker gameplay yesterday
yeah it was fun watching the new glitches was cool
Tbh if I grind my swims again I could go for a top time again
It's just a matter of if I really want to lol
Although Joaish is playing it now he'd be fun to race if I grinded runera3Hmm
sounds like you're leaning towards "yes"
I still wanna have rf be my core
WW I can kinda just play
@RuneRavenFP i only know 1 wind waker runner
I just remember everything I only have a single setup written down for pause storage lol
Wdym 30% give or take is pretty consistent
sorry that this was explained already, but how does dodge master come into play?
cough cough just use averages or triangular numbers cough
And do NOT use feeling fine
It will remove your repel gel
ive used feeling fine like twice FeelsBadMan
Thank you so much for that! its honestly already helped me a ton
This was a really good stream with the tips and the commentary.
Google translates all the text a lot
excited to watch the vod. thanks homie
when we getting the next part of dark star Kappa
"I'll send you a big hug jk rowling"
That is the greatest first time chat
You are my new favorite chatter
as they say, "every day you learn something new."
text doesn't exist, you just get item
text is faster by a factor of about 6
i guess it saves 5-10mib per seed
still time for me to join? :tf:
i remember when i wanted to actually join but then i realized i kinda dont like race settings
Damn, is this a fight ch7 scale lava piranha seed
you forgot to buy slow go Kappa
eating leftover chicken w/ brown rice, Monterey cheese and 2 sunnyside eggs
@joshfromsumter it's basic, but it's eazy to make and very filling
didn't someone actually guess correctly last time?
i guess 2 times right with 232
trick you did for the record, why what that banned from races?
gonna pretend she cooked a star bit a la Mario Galaxy
it's mostly noticable in text uninterrupted by animations
fancy seeing them chill on the beach
pink? lavender? my color is off lol
the wild goose chase for the weight this time? or actually late mansion
wot's with all these volt shrooms
lol and you are flipped just noticed
lol not too much just been big chillin
just complain you dont have something and the game will give it to you out of spite
I'm watched so many vods that i might as well try to catch you live
what the hell happened to her
she's going through her emo phase
she looks like she was in a cartoon explosion
She was too close to the sun
is this regular upgrade locations or full gear shuffle? i know races were experimenting with the latter
doing gusty gulch here feels bad
bye stanley, you'll be missed everytime
saw somethin but we dont snitch
help him you monster he's drowning
Help him, he doesn't know how to swim
before i got into pape rando i was entirely neutral on goombario but after seeing all of the hate for him i now love him
i never really understood it, the hate that is - just that he's kinda useless
c'mon... he's just a little guy... he's your friend........
he thinks mario is SO COOL and then mario leaves him to drown in the jungle
like if you cry every time
ch2 it is i guess lol
i was, and im not sure if i care tbh lol
Phantom, do I need to clip that/
is the kbf staircase skip entrance fix so bad? you seemed agast
haven't heard jcog's take on it, and i only know yours because i did watch the yt video over a week late
can't help you guys if you don't voice the opinions on the discord:p
i can still special case it *shrug*
yeah i can't exactly use that as an argument in the dev discord
i mean, I'm still saying just turn the shorten cutscenes option into a speedrun option that just nukes all dialogue and cutscenes
if people want cutscenes they can turn it off
yeah i've done a bunch of zootr and having no cutscenes is kind of great
they still do have some, like the oot water temple post boss cutscene is still almost a minute, but i know what we're getting at here
anyway, gotta bounce, gl hf on the rest
Was there a new skin/texture pack released recently?
can he do beam if you haven't lit up the room?
i thought he could only do it if the light was on
well, he's dead, so it doesn't matter
my best guess is that he only beams if you've hit the lantern at least once
general guy about to get obliterated
just cheat in fortress we won't tell anyone
"can i at least get capped" famous last words
you're being haunted by goombario's ghost
"you left me to die, mario.............."
it was all according to plan
peril strats and missing i mean
what happens if you never saved the yoshis? would you be just softlocked?
hopefully no one skipped the yoshis
the classic reverse boots upgrade seed
Sounds like it evens out. Two bads make a right?
lots of beating up children in chapter 7
weight's gonna be in like. star haven shop
god forbid he do his job
damj can't believe he's trying to do his job
judging by this two key items hidden behind optional things, maybe a third super important item is hidden behind... i dunno.... big boss blooper
you've exceeded even the boss blooper. you are now... big boss blooper
I was planning on it but barely missed it
i think my favorite part is how few power increasing badges you've found
why keep jam and jelly when you rarely get 50FP? for the money?
locked away for crimes against game balance
you might be based solely on yoshis and goomba king being required
top 4 of lmbm is max and rod so I cannot watch that shit
Gluto also just lost so idc
We should remove the mirror it confuses that one guy in the discord
so much money in this seed
can i offer you an egg in this trying time
just do super blooper too at this point. this seed is hateful
just a bunch of really great checks rn
but I am staring at 2 hours and only 2 star spirita
mario being pelted with rocks ASMR
the race is a teaching moment.  for bad seeds.
I'm at work for ot 😩
it teaches us that lord goombario giveth and lord goombario taketh away
still no way to get boots
Boots comes down to either Weight or Ruins Key at this point
mega quake being as cheap as it is, is a godsend
crying in the club for this trash seed
at least this is better than the new year's seed
new year seed was a trip
i think the funniest part of new years seed is that one could've gotten parakarry much earlier
frying pan, the hit new game now on PS4
2 hours and 19 minutes later, the first boots upgrade
yeah you definitely made the right call, this seed just sucks
Also that 4th Ruins Key is such a troll
what if something is behind the 4th key
GL!! Hope it’s not giving you too much trouble
you missed the worst of it
goomba king required. reverse boots; third ruins key in tubba's castle. weight behind super boots
come on, last fortress key on cloudy climb
never noticed the digimon in the background, clearly a man of culture
total playtime just for randomizer? or pape overall
was gonna say its gotta be more than that
my wife points out that there is a subway station in toronto named "pape"
What happens if you skip the check with a required item and use the Stsr Stone?
Would it ever be worth doing that check after beating 7 in a situation like this?
Mostly just if you found Fortress Key in Palace
Did you open the shortcut at least?
this is really a game about beating up kings
Been good, thanks. :) just been studying for the comptia a+ certification
Everytime I watch you play this game I remember how great this gane's ost is
Wanna eventually get into cybersecurity work
i'm assuming you're gonna up and away the duplighosts?
always forget that it's chapter 7's scale
Boy hits them to the moon LMAO
honestly you're so overpowered that idk how much it matters that you won't be in peril
unleashing the true power of the postal service
bowser is getting bully i see
this whole Bowser segment is kinda laughable
you and m4 were on the same turn
imagine if you hadn't full cleared
yeah i was watching the finishes with baited breath lol
And goombario remains at the bottom of the river.
rest in peace goombario, you were sacrificed so we could beat mx by eleven seconds
can we start with goombario Kappa
GL with the race gamer Kappa
YALL BETTER SUB TO PJANTOM5800 ON YOUTUBE
idk why it ain't popping up here >.>
Well I guess I just missed the weekly, but GG
Thanks for comming with me last week BTW.
paper mario was the first game i ever beat where you couldn't keep playing after reaching the end so i left it on the "the end" screen for like an hour waiting for it to change
because up until then the only games i had ever actually beaten were pokemon
SM64 does the same thing too, don't it
I think the DS version changed that though
we didn't have super mario 64 for whatever reason. we had most of the big N64 games but not that one
i ahve food and ready for this
It's still crazy to me that Paper Mario was like one of the last 3 games released for N64
when is hint tracker coming back Kappa
remember as a kid i open zelda mm on Christmas played it for like 3 hours then my mom come in and said you know you still have gifts left right
when i was a little girl i opened a little toy car first one year and just played with that for a while. just on top of the other presents.
i didn't get alot of games as a kid for Christmas
I wanted BN4 for christmas, my brother got me both version. I couldnt believe I got both LUL
honestly you dodged a bullet, partners in time sucks
listen the NA version was brutal
bowser's inside story is decent but yeah
i think BIS is the second-best
3ds emulator works great for me
the DS pokemon games were a hugely difficult problem for emulation iirc
that why pokemon run like ass on ds and 3ds emulator
i remember fighting to get jp platinum working when it leaked
I tried citra with fire emblem shadows of valentia. This first thing you do is run in a big field and it runs like pure ass
Bruh Valentia is a set up
the N64 and the pokemon game from DS on are like. notoriously awful to emulate
I don't remember B/w crashing on me
i had no problems running bn2 with bizhawk and obs
I think one city was ass
they a list of games on citra website that tell you what games works good and games that doesn't work that much and stuff that just wont boot
honestly i mostly only emulate things that are easy to emulate. like NES, SNES, GBA, gamecube
never mind ill check on Citra when I'm home
tales of the abyss just wont boot on 3ds
though some games just work badly no matter what
Dolphin hasn't let me down yet
Tales of Abyss don't work?! sad
it's very funny that it's easier to emulate the wii than the N64
saturn is also a huge pain, so there's just something about that era
@Nekonayzz yeah i even try it game wont even load
I did the play then replaying it on Ps2 emulator
yeah this game doesn't emulate well in my experience
Rowf's seed not needed, hmm? KEKW
I haven't it act up on Bizhawk
even nintendo's official emulators don't run this game well
the problem with trying to replicate hardware via software is that it sucks
oh I know for sure lol
I still have my paper mario on wii
I've been using Dolphin for Metroid Prime 2 rando and since I got a proper gaming rig, it worked like a dream (Whereas previously the CPU had trouble with distortion effects)
go back, you forgot to fight moles
the moles still have to talk to you about your extended warranty
damn, almost 500 hours on rando
so by the end of the week lol
any more pokemon lets go runs this week?
how long for the rando tutorial to hit youtube?
yeah, gil told me to watch the seed
oh speedy spin... how I missed you
same, and people want him inn the house
with all these star pieces youd think panels was turned on
the reason was to have a single jump for qwuick change
would be nice if we could put goombario in the ch7 wall holes
hey can we remove bowser entirely
i just play as it is, im bad at thinking of improvements
Right now, the only one I can think of is some way of implementing Goombario as a hint system, but I'm well aware that would need some serious balancing
Ah, haven't heard them to be fair
i like goombario for hints better than merluvlee
i want a way to save without jumping and using kooper
someone was talking about removing the ghost you fight before Final Troopa
...... maybe make the hints a toggle option?
but every seed I play has hints disabled
since it'd be nice for if you completely forget a check but i could see it getting abused for escaping bad checks
I don't see a point in hints
Depends on the game too. I know ALTTPR/SMZ3 isn't to particularly fond of hints either
yeah i think hints are mostly unnecessary in this game
for gear shuffle extra ultra boots in a block in the final save room to guaranteed damage for final bowser
my big thought for the hints would probably be if you get down to only x number available, goombario could give you like some "travel guide" style advice but
put ultra boots in toad room chest in peachs castle
I think I said that to Ice
like i said.  i could SO see that getting abused fast for "i don't wanna do yoshis, blooper, or moles.  goombario, tell me which heck i sign up for"
or I said something about the ultra boots being an extra
but didn't put it in Suggestions
how'd the race go? I took a "poor-life decision" nap
....... enable goombario only to tell you if you need to do rosie
put a guaranteed Progressive in Star Haven or peach castle
fish in the desert. What kinda sadist does that to an old lady.
should i post the ultra boots suggestion in the rando discord?
i don't care if the check is easy, i just don't want her to have a good time
"i can squirt five times" yeah??
time to save some yoshis ig
there shall be five yoshi children in the village, which is five too many
i thought it was funny, for ttyd final boss I had 50HP 50FP and 30BP
you mean go to Ch 7 right away right?
i think it's higher than 5 since i think m.bush is 5 in vanilla
throw my memory away ig lol
no wonder i'm always redoing my chapter difficulties LOL
the realization that Koopa Bros are the only bosses who regularly trek to Bowser's/Peach's Castle in the fuckin' SKY
He got some strong toes. Do you think Ralph is on ff?
alright time for gundam and dinner with the wife. see you later and good luck with the rest of the seed!
war crimes and dinner, yummy evening
coould they not also remove that cutscene
just go straight to phase 2
hmmmmm sudden wonder for if they could figure out other locations to potentially put progressive boots + hammer (like lantern ghost) that would be more of a middle ground between vanilla gear and full gear shuffle
Cut scenes in randos are pointless, cut scenes in door randomizers are absurd.
one day we'll have no cutscenes
maybe?  though it would also just be nice to more regularly see randos where ch5 isn't the first beaten
then the people who don't even interact with the community shouldn't really have much of a say imo
I know I see Icebound more frequently
Look at Ocarina of Time randos. They removed a lot of cutscenes because why would you want to replay the same things over and over again and waste time. Especially considering that these randos are centered in tournaments and races.
yeah like there's an abundance of cutscenes in here that can be clipped
I don't understand why they insist on keeping it
Not sure if this helps, but use Ocarina of Time as the standard. They cut the cutscenes.
we don't need these damn cutscenes
cut my time playing this thing so I can move on
@Andy finished a door and key randomizer for ALttP in 2 hours and 15 minutes.
i'm confused for why they keep them since it's not like anyone playing a rando has never played these games before + thus never SEEN these cutscenes before
you can literally have an option for, hey here's the cutscene if you want to watch
andy is really good at alttp that prob why
Am I imagining things, or is this Chapter 1 Junior even lower HP than usual?
and then the devs hear us and readd "hold b for 6 minutes" into time /jk
Guess I'm not used to 1-scaled Chapter 7 Junior
you mean the devs who remain invisible lol
we don't need to see them for them to hear us-
it'd make a lot of these not-so-good checks a little better
did Icebound say how many cutscenes we had? like 40 mins?
Icebound probably will go back or something
They need to separate the importance of the cutscenes in regular play and randos. Two different mediums.
Back to Chapter 6 then lol
Paralyzing Electro Blooper will never not be funny to me
people reply to my post in the rando discord with just look at the spoiler log or use the hint lady
There is an option to remove them
should i just delete the post lmao
it's not intended for them anyway
Oh did he interact logically with the shitters LOL
i don't use the hint lady or check the logs
I'll check the Discord and get upset at comments right?
alltp rando is great only if i can get the enemy randomizer to work for it
It's easy to just insert them somewhere
I think the rando can survive with one less coconut.
some of the suggestions i seen was pretty good random bosses sounds cool but idk if it possible without fucking with some of the code
Do you have to beat prologue in rando?
i didn't look at it cuz i know it wasn't possible
4:06:37! lol 37 seconds slower than than my last time
I PB'ed couldve been better tho xD
honestly I got nervous I was gonna miss something in a race setting, so I did like every check xD
I wish I could play during races
Oh perfect! I couldn't catch it live but I'll definitely check it out on youtube
but yea GG guys ^~^ I have a ton of homework I gotta knock out xD so im gonna lurk, but ill chatch you guys a little later
I gotta get some practice in tomorrow
play that video in the background
Oh, BTW, a Majora's Mask Rando I called earlier this week had this tune in the custom music for one of the runners
what you mean it's important haggYep
It was in caves I think, and it was using the N64 Zelda soundfont
oh yeah I definitely remember hearing Paper Mario tracks in there
MMR has too much music in there
But yeah, you can have random custom music for N64 Zelda rando. I'm half expecting the music team to turn something around from Sonic Frontiers before the end of the month. That OST is an absolute BANGER.
the music team is too flipping good
Think you can afford Rip yet? lol
How do you feel that Ch5 is almost always the first one to complete?
getting ch 5 out of the way
That is a very good point
dumb question, but is this another race or just another seed?
still fun, I have gotten through quite a bit of your teaching tricks and randomizer seed from the other day. good stuff
Did they change the berries to special item class instead of having it take space in the inventory?
why the hate for pallos? lol
Squirt on shy squad you say?
We now return you to your regularly scheduled curbstomping
I may have bought a Steam deck
somehow integrate trap items? Like a bit cheer could be a trap coin going off on Mario
but idk what theming you would want to go with
popes alerts is a little much sometimes
i love his streams either way
I had to shut off Popesquidward’s stream because one guy kept spamming stuff for the 100 bit count. Really annoying.
I have gone numb to his alerts
The spamming really disrupts the content. One guy on Axel Larsen’s streams spams diatribes about Lara Croft.
I didn't get a chance to see, what happened lol
ooo purple bombette looks amazing phanto274Love
I got 5th in kof yesterday
I got to play an athena ditto
The people playing on the setup next to that set looked annoyed because our monitor was the loudest at the table LOL
There was lots of backdash noises and psychoballs
Kukri is my only char not making noises the whole time LOL
I mean using soap on drivers is historically not a good idea
Oh, and I voted already, but gonna say HARD yes to The Book of Mario
Is this… a legendary blue key seed? Kreygasm
I have to savor this moment if it’s true LUL
But it’s Always Kreygasm to see the blue key used
This is more of a troll check than anything else especially when it’s rarely required
Narrator: It was not Super Blooper.
We can imagine and conjure up the palace key that way it’s in our pocket Kappa
Heya speaking of the key LUL
I can tell this seed has been one big troll the whole time because of Rosie LUL
I take it we know where the Dark Lord of the Sith Goombario is at?
Luigi wearing red just seems more normal than Mario
Green crystal King… is it March already?
I'm still new. are you still wanting to find water stone or does that check not matter?
was dead like 40 damage ago
I was wondering about bubble berry myself. Are there checks on the opposite side of the area where it is used?
Blue key bait was glorious this seed
Now to pick up Goombario for the memes on your way to bowser Kappa
i just heard jcog say it was super close
Ah so it was a very sweaty race then
that wouldve been a sick one to be restreamed
@fedepape there can only be one Sith apprentice
Lord Goombario only takes one supreme bot to be his apprentice Kappa
oh hey, COMPLETELY forgot about stream
posted in your memes channel lmao
Also I just got back from grabbing food sorry I missed the bots lol
THIS MF'ER JUST ARMORED THROUGH MY 2 BAR SUPER
I was the opposite end of the SCREEN
why are you burning your bar then smh
tried to beat his option w/ my screen filling super
I'm sorry, was that a 8 cap
Why don't any% runners just do that
That's amazing, especially cause I wasn't counting
Make sure to sub this guy. He has a 5Head for this rando LUL
subscribe plz and you will be my friend
if you sub I will smile
They say Phantom will do an all Goombario seed if you sub Kappa
you get my dm just now
anyway, you plan to stream more, yeah?
E X C E L L E N T
I thought you went to rehab for this
sometimes, falling off the wagon is a part of rehad
we blame Pallos for sleeping early
most of my screencaps are of PhantomGamesBot
and, and, and, and, Pallos ditched school like a degen
I look forward to PGB exposing me anonymously
@Ohrocks can't throw stones. I ditched work today and yesterday
his school's power went out so he ditched school
sounds like a valid reason to me
Pallos literally pressed the sabotage button
Are we talking about not dealing with people cuz fuck yeah
90% of customer interaction I've had has been answering stupid questions
I’m doing good, hope all is good with you
I'm not at work rn, so it's good for me
" I ask you, a SIMPLE question: "
I committed to the bit, I had to go that far
wait, should I move up that drive/trip to your area if you're trying to move around the summer?
or should I save that trip for once you've moved
@buff00n cuz I won't turn down an excuse to come back to Seattle
thus far, I REALLY like Vegas and Seattle
"lfg dried shrooms actually taste really good at Gusty Gulch gap skip and it was a way to play?" -PhantomGamesBot
the idea that you're gonna send Phantom back the desktop you bought from him, lol
not yet, I was dealing with cats
I need them to add small Master Chief sitting and drinking a slushie
all kinds of bass-ack-wards when people who like Sonic wind up being any type of "-phobic"
today I learned that pressing up/down on your keyboard loads up messages you've typed in twitch chat
It's Reset Time™ baby! KKona ! Nothing we do matters, no timesave is good enough, and our run is very dead.
I need those seconds to blink
don't tell me I'm a boomer
I'm not a boomer; I'm just stupid
KKona makes me a little uncomfortable
unless i know the white people
boomers are blind and ignorant, I'm just depressed and [OMITTED]
this seed is slightly better on RNG
every game should have goombario mode
I'm putting that in memes channel
I was GONNA take a nap, but Hiccup's taken over my bed
cat should have the bigger bed
he's still adjusting, one minute he was affection. next second he's biting me or pawing me
HE HASN'T BEEN HERE A DAY, HE CAN'T KNOW THAT QUICKLY
then again, he was hard staring at that Samus poster I have.....
youre on pape category still idk if you know
I still want a Smash Ultimate poster of the complete fighter mural
does pg-bot pull dialogue from your chat/stream?
I'm giving this bot everything tonight
I went to work, but I didn't go to work
I called off "sick" yesterday. I came in lost in thought:
I went to work and at work
i dont think ive ever gotten everything i needed while grocery shopping
My boss took that as me still being sick, so he asked if I wanted to go home.
I work the terrible 3pm-11pm shift
i am tried today cuz of @jokehow  lmao
I forget the things I need, but make up for it by buying a buncha stuff I didn't need
should have went to bed :tf:
that's why I started to bring a list to work now
no that rando was too good
I mean to the grocery store
seeing parakarry in star haven was worth it
oh yeah it's red for me
@Nekonayzz 12pm to 8pm sucks cuz I gotta be up early enough, but get out late enough that everything's closed
all sanity no letters and no koot yup
some custom colors don't appear on mobile
Buffoon yeah, 12 - 8 is shit
but I can't interact with any of friends with this shift
I'm at work while they free
I still think it's funny that Twilight Princess can't be beaten without one of the sword techniques
the Wii U is surprisingly easy to hack
I'm hopping between you n' Raven's stream, rn
The bot is sending out goodness?
I'm giving the bot my everything in Raven's chat. I'm scared for my future.
Tears of the Kingdom will probably have him do something with making maps so you can see the floating islands
so how does the route for this work?
weapon durability in Zelda does not work
you need DLC for the Master Sword to last 200 hits
in OOT and MM the there were upgrades but you needed side quests to make them unbreakable and stronger
i mostly didn't mind weapon durability
also rupees were hard to come by
@Ohrocks I did nothing but farm ores, so I was pretty decent with money
cuz I sure as shit wasn't gonna break good weapons on random enemies
I used a glitch in Master Mode so I didn't want to grind
uh oh, Raven, you gotta PB now
We love bots that say random shit
y'know of all chu chu colors, at least there wasn't a white chu chu
I'm assuming that why we don't see white ink in Splatoon that often
wasn't there a splastfest that one time
but it's not a default color, right?
there is no thinking while you run this game
they should move the shield icon so i don't accidentally click it trying to claim my points
i know i can do that but i don't feel like it
It did thanks FeelsOkayMan Derusted MM3D and practiced WWHD during cutscenes LUL
I just wanted to explain that I haven't been watching because I thought you wanted distance from the community and I wanted to respect that Flushed 👉 👈
I'm gonna go get food and lurk, hope the rest of your run goes well FeelsOkayMan
well you may no that sabxander bopped me in this category so I bopped him back
just like how ratio bot dissed him so he outratioed the ratio bot and then it got shadowbanned on twitch
so I am convinced that kalle demos has some RNG because the grapple is bugged in wwhd
hookshot and grapple are both bugged
because mx_four wont do them for me
Abra is mildly difficult to capture
This February is gonna be the busiest February of my life
if they're both named "1" how do they tell themselves apart
Is let’s go Pickachu, longer than Pokémon Yellow?
Ya that what I remebe, I guess they added more stuff
Playing Wind Waker with filthy hands actually makes the game load faster
there's 150 and more to see
to be a pokemon master is your destiny
Oh ya, I forgot they did that in this, very diffrent type of Pokémon game
Do you know how long Pokémon Scarlet is ?
I thought it would be shorter because of the open world factor
Scartlet was rock solid somehow even though BdSp still had the old out of bounds walk to the credits
In most Pokémon, your Pokémon only need to be in the 50s
i have no idea what a hawluchad is i haven't even play sword or scarlet yet
Werster beats red with a level 53 Raikou
Is mt silver in the game, can’t rember
What pokemon does the one you just caught evolve into?
they should make bridget the best character
You're doing WHAT to that rock dinosaur?
I found the "Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!: Official Trainer's Guide & Pokédex"
in my search to "obtain" it
rival asked if your pokemon died and then when you said no asked if you wanted them to fix that for you smh
man just loves his cat okay don't judge him
why this idiot let the kid go
okay but what is that rhydon picture behind him too
the cat i'll allow, the dinosaur is a no from me
I've been leaving your randos on our living room tv if my mom leaves said tv on while she's out.
i'm also not sure how i feel about them getting rid of helicopter doduo omg
she hasn't turned it off yet, it's been going since 11am my time
btw Fraymakers has a workshop page now
eddaket told me something I never thought of the other day. If you get bulbasaur you can hold off on bellsprout so you can evolve it.
well that exculsive to eevee of couse
no one wanted your lame autograph
>starmie is such a cute pokemon
also true Pika is right there
pikachu is on your shoulder, i feel like that's more offensive than if it WAS in your party lol
which one is easier to run with?
just.  oh i COULD coo over how cute this pikachu is, but instead i'll do it over this star creature
first pikachu isn't cute enough, now it's just not good enough period.  this is a rough day for pika
out of a job with Starmie kicks him out
he said this is a test and doesn't heal yall
he learned from his grandpa, who doesn't even remember his grandson's name
and he completely accepts any answer you give him too
"oh yes, my grandson's name is DEFINITELY Buttface, how could i have forgotten"
I don't even remember Silph Co
I hate the Rocket get up
Archie in White suit was superior
Hey Phantom I have a programming question you might be able to answer can you help me out?
Do you know how to parse an E 10 array?
will he at least still heal you after killing your pokemon about six splits later
plot twist, the lavender tower question wasn't a threat, it was a promise
wait this run was still pb potential?
I just came back to this channel for you to have goombario mode
el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo I just came back to this channel for you to have goombario mode
I just came back to this channel for you to have goombario mode  el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo I just came back to this channel for you to have goombario mode
The bot supplied our raid message
I just fucked up different things
WT was genuinely perfect though LUL
ah good we have some better pictures on the wall this time
Remember that one fight in radical red
Where what your AI partner did won or lost the fight
rival is in and of himself a mistake sorry phantom
I think Pallos also lags when he thinks
I always thought nidoking was the main Pokémon to use in these speed runs.
Remember when I commented on one of your VODs about the bowser fight randomly getting cut ?
That hasn’t been happening anymore to my knowlefge
Blue like I'll take this gym over bawkKek
Juggler Nelson? More like Juggle Deez Nuts
If you have Bttv slots this would be funny to spam during rando pape runs
2-37 is my record against the endgame on pace lmao
the run was bad though i didn't really care if it won
if i'd pbed it would've been by like 3 seconds tops
that fight's terrible but i didn't think it could go that wrong
is this a potential pacer PacePalConfused
you get crit every attack or something?
Already off to a bad start
you could've pb'd by MINUTES if u got a growlithe
starmie turninga round to look at you like o3o
is Hydro there to guarantee kills?
hydro is there to tempt you into using it and losing your run
timer0 on 3ds sucks i give up
I added this one to my channel even tho i dont stream
also raven grats on decent wwhd time
time to go for the champ ranges
yeah it's sp atk is high
ok yea i was kinda worried cause it was at 52 and i didnt see the sp atk on level lol
Mega evolution is in this game???
Hey phantom could you trade me some exclusives :)
As strong as the average phantom viewer
I dont like that emote it scars me
yea if you can psychic dragonite you can psychic pidgeot with 2 x sp atks lol
psychic guaranteed on pidgeot at 139
if you split 20.9 seconds early you would have pbed
Cmon aren't you a pape rando player just cheat smh
That split ended as I raided what happened there
Even after the smooch that dude can't help you out
but fr fuck that fight lol
That crit woulda been clutch tho
Oh yea before I got food you said you wanted to tell me something
Or is that for after stream
So the game hated you but it also didn't
bro just getting a kanga in any% when i haven't had a good kanga in aop yet
Is this the last activity for stream today
Morp was my filename for ww
oh shit here comes the best line in the game!!!
I still have my raid message copied from the bot
el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo I just came back to this channel for you to have goombario mode
el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo I just came back to this channel for you to have goombario mode
That raid message is the first thing the bot said as I went live 5m in LOL
el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo I just came back to this channel for you to have goombario mode
i will never not use those tags when running this game
yea this is a lot more cringe without a flyer lol
this is an above average starmie
yea that dragonite stood no chance
Let's hope my twitch loads the page when the raid happens lol
that Bow icon is so good
oh that too! I meant your switch one PrideLaugh
it's been a long time since I've played this, but why do we have to catch 50 pokes?
He wants to tell you something
I was talking abt the ratata but that also works lol
Why does blue show up just to give you 5 great balls
How did he not see you
That dude is illegally selling fish
Spinners in BW/B2e2 are the worst
Probably XY/ORAS because trainers act differently in SM
What's up Phantom. Going smooth so far?
if Pikachu came through the screen like that for me, I'd get the shotgun ready asap LOL
but yeah, I haven't used steam to talk to anyone in years
I just do family sharing with a couple of peeps now on it PrideLaugh
it's really heavy but holy crap it was good
that's basically what I did for the most part, except for one night when I just felt like playing it and rando went like shit PrideLaugh
I think the Joy-Cons are fine as part of a handheld but I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to force single Joy-cons for some games
Mostly this game and Super Mario Party came to mind, but still
I knew there was another one PrideLaugh
i've played that like a total of like 2 times
it was kinda a waste of money LOL
i did stuff day one for Switch and hoped it would be good
I mean it was fun for what it was, but after a couple of hours you just decide to burn the cart because it's useless after that
I bought 1, 2, Switch, BotW and the Bomberman one
i bought the special edition animal crossing switch last year and it didn't come with a game i was like tf is this bs
tbf he's a really smart dude
adding a game is a big selling point
guess what the japanese version of the switch come with the game
do you want to do a trade?
so they combined go's mechanics with some of gen 5, interesting
listen we just have to hope and pray for god starmie to come back
The Fake Out was not using Fake Out :O
pidgey wanted to be part of your team
or at least in the run
at least it's in the section where nothing matters?
that progression was weird, I couldnt find any lol
after 2 hours i just gave up
I saw you in the chat wanted to say hi but couldn't
in chat? I was stream in the rando discord
where was Chansey that made Pika lvls cracked
I didnt know they played with blue house and shy guy house open, I turned that shit off lol
its set to random, I rolled 2
I thought he set it to 4
my man was struggling unfortunately today
realized Final Bowser is not a joke
they run BP at max, Im glad FP is low enough so I could still run danger
Like he had some trash BP costs
last Stand was 6, hp 6, power plus 5
if only someone made a rando tutorial, that would be nice for these guys. But what can you do? Kappa
they'll get us to it... eventually
Yeah they need to learn it first
are we talking about the hint tracker?
I was busy so I didn't see lol
I still think it isn't a rando with the hint tracker lol
man people would disagree on that
you learn better by just doing it
I don't really talk to those people bawkKek
rather than being helped by the hints alone
I learnt better by doing ir
I learned better by crying through it LMAO
then I realized oh it's easy
I had laichan help me and thats how I finished my first seed lol
I haven't touched the earlier onea
my first seed was 7 houra
same. It was taking me about 5-6 hours at first. Now it takes me around 3.5-4 hours depending on my decisions
my first finished seed was 7 hours
for regular race settings at least
and my first finished race was 7 too
and I was like oh ok
my movement, routing, and menuing/decisions are still not great, but they're getting better
also lately I've been trying to learn different settings as well so a lot of firsts for me
I know speedrunning would definitely help with movement and decision making, at least with other categories
I know my movement is so mid rofl
understanding logic is something that I'm still trying to do, but being my first actual rando I'm working on, I'm still trying to understand all of the logic of the game
but watching Phantom do it like damn I suck
once you get the logic it's smooth
im satisfied which how ive performed due to having not done a speedrun
I watched your video while I was practicing
oh fuck!! I just remembered I couldve went to desert!!
the thing for me is just understanding when to keep checking stuff or if I should just dip out of an area
I got parakarry right before I gave up lol
also Axl, I may have sent you the wrong seed
i havent touchhed it yet LUL
and Adam does have some speedrun experience at least, but just not in this game
I can say I dont like using the brawler64 for pape
yeeee, I met him through that
yeah, he's got some crazy WR in that iirc
score attack is so fucking hard too
but yes, I do like this Blinky badge ngl PrideLaugh I love me some pac man stuff
well i guess rhyhorn didn't like that you were green
that's what I wish for too
so you should be able to use any one you want
i wish twitch did it too, i love the bow one and i know i will be sad when the day comes and it's not there
Hey Phantom! GOod luck friendo. got a pb in Sm64 rando so thats nice
ty! how's the run going for you?
bawkPause I will attain Bow eventually
but a normal poke ball catch it okay game
i downloaded the hint tracker but I dont understand how to import my seed LUL
oh so by that logic we dont have to worry about people using it for races
im just saying as it is right now it cant be used
oh, like if you find an item but you dont have parakerry
3ds runs basically two clocks so all rng manips get screwed up
i got the same seed 3 out of like
yea loopy forums got loads of peeps selling em
but i dont got 200 to randomly burn rn
when leaving desert for rugged is it faster to take parakerry or use the bouncepad?
oh you dont do any of the fossils
this bot really do got everything huh
you should make the bot self promote
alright who ever has experience in Megaman classics, which one should I touch
now how cracked is this Starmie bawkPause
asking because I'm playing Megaman soon ish. haven't touched the series
I have a way to play em
it is overrated but you cant deny the jump from 1 to 2... same thing with Battle Network too LUL
look him in the eye as you teach starmie fire blast
when does ice have his run?
i go to the denist tomorrow so I might have to miss it
another run, another day of pikachu having to watch someone coo over how cute starmie is directly in front of it
is it normal to struggle with power shock lantern. I know how bad PS is but damn
after failed twice I got my first dizzy stomp LUL
trying to get good at mashing, failing
so yeah you definitely came out on top
why Dodrio out in the front this time
rolled a 0 speed staryu, sadge
am I missing anything major by watching from the middle? (have not seen anything pokemon since maybe crystal)
(ie should I come back later?)
alright, I'll try to not be an old fart and watch a new game.
one fear cause this Starmie is pretty slow
best of luck then. I'll ask all the stupid questions until I fall asleep
red, blue, crystal, and pokemon stadium
but that was what.... 20 years ago?
idk blue IS still here as his own concept
Your Rival just replaces Blue basically
cause in red and blue, Blue was the of Rival
blue is basically only here to stare judgingly at team rocket from what i've gathered
is this the equivalent of an encounter in pape?
literally I forgot wtf Sabrina do in the series
slow and brittle, good to know we got the grandpa starmie this run
this Starmie compared to our God yesterday
it has glass bones and paper skin
what the wr for this game?
if rng has too much of an effect, it's not fun.
what's up with these damn protects
it called you a mere child. kick it's butt
this 3d business is weird. Also, full colour. I'm used to gray-scale bushes.
so it looks like they have expanded move-sets but I recognize all the pokemon
now I'm wondering if I have batteries for my gameboy colour to compare...
so for any% is it beat all the gyms or is there a different goal?
did Rocket have a special theme
why would u not use fearow
Forgot your Starmie was slow RIP
you got stuck for almost 10 seconds because of that trainer
how does that mechanic even make sense? that took waaaaay too long for a trivial "puzzle"
I love the ace trainers in this game
the kick animation is still too long....
game devs. how. how does this add value to the game?!
not like the God at like 150+ but cool enough
Everyone's favorite Poison-type Elite 4 YEP
why she had to glare and hit it
grandpa starmie can't hear you, it's too busy with its sudoku
Hey Phantom phanto274BLANKIES how are you doing?
I'm not holding my breath. You're holding your breath
also I know you're not playing pape right now, but I just wanted to say I watched your tips video from a few days ago and it was very helpful! phanto274Hype
planning on watching that later tonight after your stream!
grandpa starmie did NOT deserve that gold
I hope to gen a seed for you in Pape bawkPause
I have fun watching you blowing these seeds
I just gotta fiddle with it
because they hyper focus on the wrong things I suppose
well you'll probably breeze through it
when I see the whole thing, you mind as well just add an extra hour just to collect all the spirits
because you'll likely in full on go mode
you know what capture card are you using for the switch, kinda looking into one
all because you caught a rat
i need to figure out where time usually starts for the fusion rando
so i can actually track my time with livesplit
@WEEGEE666 when you hit start on the file
@blacktiger51 thanks, just found that out as you mentioned it
if it works like this, it'll leave it be
cause I'm currently at work 🙃
the variables affecting things is bawkBlub
I forgot bill turned himself into a pokemon on accident
I'm trying to understand by observing lol
I know catches do play a part tho
I feel like the menu pokemon keep getting worse lpl
krabby does look like a bish to catch
I've been here for a bit I just forgot to post anything lol
imma double check again cause work be huge distraction, you okay with the setting string? or you want the settings id bawkBlub kinda drained here
bawkKek I'm surprised that passes in Twitch
Sucking miltank tits is family friendly
Misclick of a lifetime right there OMEGALUL
Just like when monado got banned and a day later got unbanned and had partner
there is nothing wrong with jokehoDrink
Twitch admins need to stop eating at their desk or something
a couple level in dkc 3 have straight up levels but you don't just hold straight up lmao
Phantom for port priority this year we gotta figure out who's getting people sick we gotta get the tradition to 3 years in a row
Nope we gotta keep it going
I'll go lick some doorknobs at work before that weekend
I wanna play kof but jibca is working
Look I needa kill about 3 hours
And if I reset once that's about it
Anyways on that note lurk time
Any oob tricks or rng tricks you do?
That’s a shocker, even Pokémon black 2 had a few more tricks
Didn't Excadrill just streamroll the game lol
i remember all the time when i was a kid i just did the missingno glitch to dupe master balls and rare candy in gen 1
I never played gen 1 but I played gen 2
Lance was the champion in gen 1 I know
i catch a missingno once and gave it a rare candy and its evolved into a fricking kangaskhan
The elvolution cutscenes are 20+ minutes a piece
I hope they bring him back in some way or reference
I wonder how a rare candy tastes like
do we have another God starmie? bawkPause
Cinnabar Island is where you could find missingnumber
here so fast it that took me to your main page
wait u need a cute pokemon to get into her gym?
I wonder if Ghastly would be cute
@Gay_Plant_PR Why would I cook my mom
i just looked and u can show any pokemon to get into the gym
You should watch the pac man 2 gdq speedrun
I stayed up until 2 AM to watch it
upset at the fact that two things happened at the same time last night
should be at the mercy of goombario instead
but the stray gdq run started in the middle of lopez's run
Critical hits doubles the damage in this game?
I thought gen 6 killed that
Gen 6 had a lot of changes
because they had to fix Gen 5 sleep mechanics
I did not even know they changed how crits worked
damn, gonna get WR just to spite me? that's crazy
By what time you normally reach Victory rd?
The bot just did a fuzzy prediction in my chat
nah, I'd have done the "was" in ALL CAPS
not saying I wouldn't space out words, but I usually just say FUCK when I'm wrong on fuzzies
is this an unfortunate - spatk starmie
Is stream still up or is it just me?
i want a big chocolate structure
If opponent use protect, is that a big deal in speedrun?
simple fix make all the gyms double battles
Most broken thing in Pokemon: diagonal movement
Pikachu acting like he's gonna do shit in this e4
you might move up 1 on the leaderboard
3 mins timesave is nothing to sneeze at tbh
have you done easy barrier skip yet
looks like sub 3 10 is hard
it uses a shield turn after targeting a wall
was found by me and gralic
it's like bottle swipe but while holding shield
cant believe the world record is 2 59
are you in the wwhd discord
I think I left your server because I was trying to give you space
you wanted me to send you the setup, right?
o7 for jigglypuff + nidorina, you did not deserve this beating
oh yeah I still need to time the route here
there's an alternate island hop from ETI to DRI but I don't even know if it's faster
it's probably the same speed honestly
This is a starmie of all time
the two routes are: 1.FH -> ETI -> island hop clip to DRI (savewarp or get lucky and land on the island) -> outset -> NTI -> island hop void to outset or 2. FH -> outset -> ETI -> island hop void to outset -> NTI -> island hop void to outset
nothing like warehouse work to completely fuck up your fingernails
i need to pick up a rune factory game at some point
ohh that why you name start with rune
i think i played a little 3 back on ps3
my family is holding my switch hostage
my backlog is pretty big hard to really buy alot of new games
yeah well zero take place before 2
chapter 4 i think of cold steel zero start
you dont need to play that lmao
cold steel anime should tell you out this year
i am waiting for the dub i think the 1st ep is out in japan already
just sucks we so far behind japan have 3 loh games ahead of us
reverie was out in japan 2020
did you get spoil at all in cold steel? i did i was pissed
youtube recommend the ending for 4 before it was out
bluebluc is prob one of my fav enforcer
i also got spoil on who c was
he prob my least fav tbh
i hated jusis at 1st but he 1 of my fav character now
fie is broken 100 Eva she cant die in 1
very possible just to have 100 on her
alisa is very broken in 1
how far r u in 3?
btw i suggest you never look at the trails wiki ever again
the ship: this fucker is a speedrunner, i know what to do
another soul failed the hardest puzzle in paper mario
i been thinking about replaying the cold steel games before reverie
with a fat ass burrito with the WORKS
oi look at dis playa leavin dust in my server and speedrunning at the same time
about to be mad chillin' cuz fine
my friend tried to gift me RE:Verse so I can help her get an achievement
do pg skip and then fight pg
i really like the forest dungeon
this is a really good final boss fight
and thus, the cycle of Ganondorf came to an end in this timeline
all pokemon should be like that
apparently pikachu said fuck on tiktok
well if it's a nuzlocke it does
giving you a ride is all it needs to do
why is that a pinned message?
"help my crypto metamask wallet got hacked stolen fix essay t-shirt look at this cool shirt hey guys I need some emotes and graphic design commission"
i need someone to finish this essay
I'm experimenting with ghost peppers in recipes. Just gotta be careful not to touch them directly, but results are promising
I'ma squish an emote next time
i ate a ghost pepper for a yugioh card once would not recommend eating it raw
the oil from ghost peppers is actually dangerous LUL I just grab them with paper towels and have been using an immersion blender anyway
too lazy to spend 100 points
the oil from ghost peppers is basically the same kind of thing used in pepper spray
see i just kinda forgot about editing emotes
the Phantom read the bot's dono message and got fired
idk why "the Phantom" showed up like that
Got my drink and my snack ready
BRO I SWEAR this streamer is ALWAYS on outset island. I was just AFK for an hour and a half and THEY ARE STILL HERE. YEP 0 runs DO THEY EVER MAKE IT PAST THIS LEVEL
Well I picked a good time to start cooking dinner again it seems
i didn't think that would work anyway
time to have 2 streams open
Only 12.3k channel points away from giving phantom a rando seed
i have your and phantom stream open
Fair warning, I’ve just got done watching two completely trash Metroid Prime seeds. Be afraid no matter who genned this.
the Ezekiel easter egg is such a nice touch
you can even control Ezekiel as well
I see this is off to a start lol
I think we need to train the bot more so it can say sNeed over seed more.
I was thinking, how could I make this 'fun'
Guess who just did their first staircase skip?
and then I went back thru the door and softlocked my self LUL
what that can happen? softlocking there?
phanto274Lurk I sense a Rando of Randy sNeeds... and Goombario
its not a softlock, but you have to do the pit
I gave it to him rofl
yummy yummy homeward shroom. Amazing QoL addition.
I didn't think it would be that rood ROFL
5 coins would be his value
see I was trying to be nice
Goombario should just max out your coin count
Laki is a nice color this time though
if i were the shopkeeper, i'd charge to take goombario off someone's hands
just return goombario back to his family xD
all good, I came for the rando. Hi is just a bonus
since it isn't a speedrun, will you open the special chest under the chandelier to see what's in it?
could you imagine if rando put something in that chest?
but! it could be important this time!
that's true this is the rando it could be anything
is it time to cheat for that? Kappa
i seen joe do it looks easy
this seed do be giving out lots of keys lol
goombario is probably the leftovers they throw in the dumpster every day at closing time
you're so fast p8cking things up. s9meday I'll be able to tell the difference in keys
the hint tracker is so confusing to me. I'll get it someday
is this race settings or other?
yeah I just fiddled with a few things only
what fucking level are they starting on
well that's no fun. that saves everyone's sanity
i am begging them to learn the game
the combat is so important to this rando
well I think Supreme plays that way lol
next seed I'm gonna do I'm gonna start at level 0
they're playing it like a zelda rando or smth
it would be so sick if these folks like participated in the rando community and learned
Can't learn if they start at lvl 15
I do want them to learn rofl
my 1st seed was like 6 hours
my first completed racetime gg was 7 hours
remember when ppl were asking what the most important thing was
and i was like 'movement' and everyone was like 'no'
Headin to the gym - GLHF
i don't remember who said that to me but someone was like nope
my movement is not the best but i can fight under level
i've only won the last 13 races in a row
@mx_four win 14 then I'll be impressed
they turned Paper Mario party members into SMRPG sprites
like the seed Spike did today
had to clear most of the game again lol
i make a lot of very slow decisions
as far as what i decide to check
and a double dip in Crystal Palace cause bombette was locked in the dumbest place
so early on i just won for it
but now it really depends on the seed whether i excel or not
was blue house and toy box open?
i think open prologue should be in the race seeds btw
i keep those two off rofl
i think a bigger sphere 0 would do a lot for variety in the logic
Hai hai and also hai hai and also hai hai. KEKW
since most seeds flow the same
speaking of stuff that open i like 4 seeds for chapter 6
open prologue for races would be good
get me in on that too
i definitely think its just better
after doing it a couple times
if only we had a place to organize this race Kappa
ooo I like the idea of that
How goes the start of the seed?
the seeds i like the most are the weird ones lol
i need to practice a bit more before i join in on a race
i thought about doin that today but then i saw you online and thought you'd have wanted to watch
if i can clear it in 3 hours maybe i can do a run too
yeah you told me you got a 2:52?
i'm not sure what my fastest is since the new fill algo
i stopped keeping track a while ago
it might've been our gdq submission
i want to run any% for that
but i'm willing to submit a rando too if you and jcog wanna try again
i can help him too depending on what it is
gonna practice some more fusion rando
he usually finds my tutoring pretty effective
the question is if we can tear him away from chameleon twist
I saw that low Flower Saver
how long can one stay with chameleon twist for, though? there's not a lot of depth to it...
well, he's on the verge of top 3 in that game
apparently its only been 18 days
making this the fastest ive ever gotten to a reward
pit at level 7 sounds gross
lvl 7 pit is ass tho
if you can kill lv7 pit the exp rewards are nuts
i love ch7 scaled ch1 personally
jammin for 5 fp to use the worst move in the game would be very funny
I see Darth Goombidious following you like the plague walesGun
I had to look away, what did you get?
so for spikes seeds can you do any 4 chapters or is it set?
i just dont understand how you would know which ones
@Nekonayzz just realize u using bawkbasoup emotes
any other wild animal in existence would not wait for the third strike to retaliate
ok im gonna play your seed
do you care if i glitch bc im feelin any% atm
so its any 4 chapters but you do a self imposed rule of "im doing these 4"
the whale didn't even retaliate though
The whale must be on walesCOPIUM
you can't tell me some of these emotes aren't good tho bawkRly
Imagine not having Goombario. That’s always the right thing to do LUL
I like watching the seeds from hell.
which partner glitches are the most helpful. it seems like paracarry and lakilester
Whelp time to clear 4 Kappa
And I know I saw mystery note earlier so this is perfectly fine
@Nekonayzz guessing u like resident evil since u watch bawk
How does that even work? You turn in the frying pan and get a cooked stone? LUL
i think following is just lastest tweets but worded differently
Oh heck yeah I like Resident Evil ! @blacktiger51 bawkWesker
resident evil is 1 of my fav game series of all time
Yep you mean a free 10 coins
i been playing resident evil since i was like 9
6 is awful fanservice done wrong
I knew it…. Goombario corrupted Gourmet Guy walesGun
that looks wrong when you come from behind
funny enough i have the platinum trophy for 6  i don't love it or hate it its okay
like 6 had some potential, just didn't execute it right imo
Re 0 you can go without knowing
0 is good but everyone hate it
people don't like how it plays. Hard like inventory management
you have 12 item spaces in total
coming into 0 blind I say is hard if you don't know what you're doing though
oh yes i had to look that up as a kid
i didn't know what to do
yeah that's the one segment everyone went huh
after that I say it's fine.
Code Veronica has one part people don't like because you can literally Softlock LOL
because you switch and it doesn't tell you
only if u don't have health
Well I got fucked by Poison Hunters before I got to the part at the Arctic
but it's when you switch back and forth with Chris and Claire after that
but you can make the mistake of giving all your items to one character and never give it back then just... be unable to beat the game depending on your items
i never kill the hunters i just run pass them
the knife is broken in that game
You know when you're critical health, they go for the lunge 8)
I got trapped at one segment because that's all it did after coming out the door
also yeah the Knife fucking cracked
pretty sure i know what part u talking about
yeah at the prison base as Chris
when the next spin the wheel stream?
let me know when that happens!
hoping the wheel land on re0
Did you fight Anti Guy when you were in 4?
I got tired of my outset simulator
Pause storage was not having it today lol
But we only had 1 instance of good rupee count lol
Also messed with not pause buffering the barrier skip method
It's genuinely free as fuck LOL
So you don't even need to learn the damn fp input
You have the same community dumbass
i just got back to 2 phantom streams open
I was wondering, why Parakarry lol
I meant why switch to the one partner that could lose you time talking to that NPC lol
so who gave u this seed?
Sadly we have ALL partners … Goombario walesGun
Or you could full clear Crystal Palace... LUL
we only need boots for 7 now
Random items is sometimes generous like that
weight and u got that 50 bucks before the shop
Generally a weird seed if you're using Weight with gear shuffle...
i am calling super boots in boo shop
Nice Tubba Key + Ultra Hammer though
its a way to flip penals so i was close
are you liking the complete random items xD
@blacktiger51 I did this curse seed settings lol
There is something deeply concerning when anti guy and Gourmet Guy have the same colors phanto274Smile
Anti guy seems stronger than the ch 4 boss
Super Boots in a panel, you don't see that every day
Supers locked by ultra hammer in a panel…. Truly Goombario has outdone himself this time LUL
I remember the furst time I saw kent. Da fuq. Almost remember when i first beat him.
and hammer locked by 60 star pieces  LUL
I CANT BELIEVE THAT WAS VANILLA bawkKek
You don’t like the walmart badge?
you had the items anyway i see no problem with that
Weird to see Laki cosplaying his girlfriend
yeah it's really good laki color
laki just took lakilulu cloud that all
Where's the Spear Guy? I can't see him
Who forced you to get goombario?
dried shroom gods out here mocking you
also, lord pebble sounds like a wonderful channel mascot
praise be to lord pebble that was a quick 1 phase
M4 did flarakarry without parakarry, then found parakarry in the next room LMFAO
i was looking at all bosses notes, "do staircase skip" okay lets try this. "do BHS" FUCK YOU!
cleared a fusion seed in just over an hour
its really not as bad as its sounds
Poor kooper is still naked and afraid
i'm thinking at some point doing an entire month of fusion rando
At least it got the status KEKW
so assuming i don't have any crappy seeds, i can realistically do 2 fusion seeds in the amount of time i normally stream
remember to praise the Lord Pebble for this bounty of Jelly
how mad would you get if the pebble lord becomes a thing lol
but is this bountiful harvest of jelly cursed for having discarded lord pebble?
Nope. This Kelly harvest can only be cursed by Lord of the Sith Goombario
your bounty will be sith goombario
cause my man had 7 jellies and 3 life shrooms
This is the man who left goombario at the bottom of a river to die. He cares not for pebbles.
in the final battle whats the most bowser can heal?
@pethanct01 that is a very accurate description LUL
i got some rough rng the other day
Phantom how many times can Hallway Bowser heal? if you let him
oh that makes so much more sense
i don't think i ever seen hallway bowser heal
I saw bowser heal a lot as a kid
You could splice bossfights from vods and commentate over them
they look like pepto bismo omg
cheap rewards on so logic req 60 for hammer so bow shop hammer should be 1st hammer req for logic
was watching a bn1 review. They said power plant comps were harder than anything in the original witcher LUL
@axl_sr I can confirm. As a kid I struggled hard not knowing the puzzles LUL
invisible roads, only place you dont auto heal, you have to place batteries in correct slots to make roads and if youre wrong you have to run back to a prog to recharge it. Oh, and PET is on a battery timer and you cant jack out.
It was so easy to get lost in loops
forgot another thing... oh youre stuck? try talking to progs for hints... BUT OH WAIT!! some progs are corrupted and you have to fight them then LUL
And that is how you get your ring zap chips LUL
and dont confuse ring zap with zap ring... entirely different chips
ring zap circles around you once and does damage
Zap ring comes from the bunny virus family while ring zap was a BN1 corrupted Prog exclusive
but wait we arent done yet
power plant comp introduces paralysis, instead of getting stun locked you can move but everytime you move you take dmg until it wears off
and when your PET battery runs out in the comp, it’s a buster only run then LUL
Lot of Sweet Shrooms this seed too
not to mention your HP won’t heal after every battle
this next one is more for childhood axl being bad but... after you fight elecman, you fight protoman before you can save, so if you lose you have to do elecman over again
I would spend 100K points just to see you do power plant comp only
@axl_sr bn1 had some.... "unique" ideas
elecman scenario beat my ass when I was young
BN1 was the only game where you can beat it with just the buster
That category is just great to watch
bn2 is possible but you need to get lucky
but I thought gregar any% already is buster only?
Sadly BN2 can’t do buster only because of the Legendary Guard * for our boy Jim
umm no, you can get 30 guards in that scenario
@axl_sr oh right I forgot about that LUL
trev, talk to the drunk in the alley LUL
something I never did as a kid LUl
also, guard* is a GMD drop in Netopia3
That is a dream never dipping palace or mountain and only go mode it
im looking at your tracker trying to figure out what you are missing cause stars arent highlighed LUL
OSS does kinda fix PP Comps, then light the hidden paths and batteries dont die.
i love how sundays seed first check was super jump charge
i mean, we already need 4 to get all of rawf's checks
Rowf’s shop kind of does it but i get what you mean like make it matter more
oooooooh, i know what you mean
You got a few thumbs-ups, it could be that people like the idea but don't have anything to say to add to the conversation
What if there was a way to insert Goombario into logic? One can still dream
I think Goombario is in some edge-case glitch logic
Also one of a few options for certain fights
Nah, it’s because it’s goombario and the other reason.
Just make Goombario a setting for extreme settings jumpless and hammerless as a hint giver
So in jumpless, Goombario can be a constant there
Gil said hell be home in a few
That can only mean something ominous LUL
Goombario seeds have a way of pushing people to their limits and beyond Kappa
i should prob message pape races at some point asking if they can do anything about the phone verification
I object to the skip sir walesGun
so level on jr by the looks of it
as long as we don't level on hallway
castle checks? maybe mega rush is in power rush spot
well, no ultra boots is always fun
i mean that kinda ultra boots
well that's kind of like ultra boots right?
I remember the Dark times when Bowser castle keys were required along with having to trek through the castle
there's more to bowser's castle other than these fights?
a part of me wishes we could refight the koopa bros just to beat them up again
what kinda seed did you run last night??
full bp and fp? how'd that happen
I made it back for the end bawkPause
Are you joinning Gil and me?
I sat in kof for 20m to find a game
And someone rage quit on me cause I OCV'd them with athena
yes and im trying the hint tracker with your spirit icons
I have a feeling of wanting to play smash
I'm hoping my group pulls through on this project and gives me a little more time off xD
I'll stick and watch 8) it'll ease the boredom at work
My Goombario Meter is receiving high readings and levels of cursed energy in this seed phanto274Smile
@Phantom5800 thanks for making those tutorial videos on YT! They've been incredibly helpful ^_^
you're the only one to guess it right on the first try lmao
Gil has a way of rolling cursed seeds that involve Goombario being in places to rub it in your face LUL
Doesn’t this already unlock 7 or am I mistaken?
There is Axl’s favorite badge we passed by that he prefers over dodge master Kappa
no i just got back and miss fuzzies
You mean we cloud 9 to dream of Goombario in the sky? Kappa
How great would it be if there was an April Fools Day seed where all item sprites and Badges are Goombario
Or if that isn’t possible make your partner locked to only Goombario
Both Goombario lovers and haters would be pleased
yo that diamond was just like, free to take
so what was u saying about parakarry? LUL
Welcome to the kind of seeds Gil rolls and plays LUL
no audio and on mobile, but gl gl!!
I did the first one tonight and DNF'd, I played horribly
what do you mean by async
I beat ch 1 and 6
I forgot there was a ruins key in a shop and a red berry
forgot is a word for what happened with slow ho
I played this seed this morning, I enjoyed it
is this really gonna be another ruins hammer 1st seed
I may give the second one a go
good, you can comment on everything I do wrong KEKW
also I feel rested today LMAO
honestly, I've been wanting to have someone watch me do things that are wrong in a seed, but I also don't want to put anyone through that or do the extra work LOL
plus, most of me is dumb decisions I realize later and movement
I’d watch still Jaye cuz I can relate haha
of def. I know I can get in the 3:1X:00. I've almost done it twice as I realized, so it's possible for me
that's what I would do as well
if it helps me learn PrideUwu
@ohheyitjaye Plus finding Dark Lord of the Sith Goombario curses seeds Smadge
Trev, last night, he was my starter LOL
@ohheyitjaye my condolences. How bad was the seed?
it honestly wasn't too bad. A couple of dumb things, but my movement and decision making was dogshit LOL
The Beauty of possibly having ultra boots chest be first logical boots
It’s your fault. All the cakes I see in this seed made me get pancake mix
Wait where was P-Up D-Down? I don't know if I ever found that one lol
That would make sense, I went there off the bat, said "no progression" and left lol
One day we will see a required blue key again hopefully
okay just wanted to make sure
i can’t incarcerate the bot :(
Looks like I’ll e watching this tonight then. I am liking watching these paper mario seed
I gtg but will try and catch y’all again later tonight :)
Yeah, unless my day takes a catastrophic turn. Which it shouldn't
I still can't believe that's an emote
This seed really did just front-load every Life Shroom in the game
there needs to be a Prologue emote for every pape game
The extra Life Shrooms were good for a noob like me tho
you are the best part of my saturday
it's raining here so it's just cozy pape strim
I live in los angeles and it Should Not Be Raining
norca has also been having flooding issues
CT; we barely had snow so far this year. All this weird weather across the country is very ominous
had the winter storm in december
and I'm like well it isn't over anyway
we get snow from December to fucking march
if it ever snows in los angeles I will be terrified
honestly April here is like the last month of snow
oh WA is such interesting weather
my brother is down in renton
How are you guys doing with the wildfires
I would consider moving to seattle but it's so rainy
lol I live in a desert
I hewrd aoregon aland cali got it bad this year
that had to been a recent change
is that just rando or the original programming
because I've been stuck there before
maybe one of my first seeds had that happen then
maybe I just thouoght the water was filled, but then I never actually checked because I thought I was stuck
so I just tele'd out and never knew
i wonder how many people will get stuck on this seed cuz of that lol
oh I also forgot i want to read this
so with this being a race but not, does it follow all the race settings? do you have to finish all chapters, no fake items, etc
okay I might skip this one since I already know where some stuff is lol
thanks. the different flags/settings for non race settings confuse me
okay look for gil's thing then
Grand finals of this kirby airride bracket someone got wobbled for 3 minutes
Apparently if you tornado spin when someone is falling after their star breaks
This game is actually funny as fuck competitively though
I need to check this out
especially since I absolutely love that game
and it's one of my top 5 games of all time
They just made a code for dolphin that makes netplay use the lan function
So you all have your own screen
So when does the league start exactly?
Have we found the Goom yet?
mmk. I'm definitely interested and want to participate
I'm guessing that's in the discord?
okay I'll def check out tomorrow then
I'll set a reminder oon my phone LOL
I was thinking, "I would have gotten that later behind the tree" but I realized you don't have the jade raven
I forgot that you don’t have supers yet LUL
Where did we find Sushie again?
I am concerned that the Yoshi kids will force Goombario into you like that one weekly seed chrisS
i really need to utilize spook more
Koopa bros got smart putting dodge master there LUL
i mean it's fast. and if you have fp stuff
GL with the run, I have 13 hours of events
not only that but also Checks pit
and it keeps the need from needing fright jar all the time too
yeah i figured that one out the hard way PrideLaugh
Bullet bills have no soul as they were created by Goombario that way
Seems supers aren’t going to available any time soon LUL
trev is goombario the source of all evils in your mind?
Goombario is not the source of all evils but is a master manipulator
He hides in the shadows of history with his tattle log of every living thing
dang he probably knows more about me than i do
" Fuck them Yoshis. " - Phantom5800
Is someone making any progress on getting Luigi playable in Pape?
just stretch your capture card upward
It'll make him taller it's the same thing
so I checked the sheets, and I don't think you can sign up anymore 3:
Kolorado LOVES getting his ass cooked, holy moly
wait, there's a sheet and then an online fill out thing
why wouldn't you want to level up strategically
first time i get to run one on stream using the WiiVC
I hate this room so much
I'm being wobbled in my favorite videogame
why ultra parakarry? is extra power or extra skill your main reason?
You also need blue key while you are here
it goes to 7? I thought it stopped at 5. nice
thanks for answering, these are the things I can only speculate on
I miss the days when blue key was required with the settings Kappa
I just realized that talking key is always vanilla.
Blue key miserable for you but a dream to watch LUL
I like the idea of red key locked behind blue key. Maximum chaos.
I don’t see how that could fit because how does tubba get motivated to chase you.
I mainly used watt and bow in my few casual runs  it's interesting to hear why others are better
Blue Key required Paper Mario seed = pedestal seed aLttP rando
i wonder how old that ceiling mushroom is
@Garioairio long enough that it should've been a dried shroom
oh man, two items from go mode
really dumb question, so the door that only opens after you talk to the ninji, where is that?
ok. randomizer has messed up my brain for regular
i mean, i can't play lttp normally anymore, grover
and i probably can't play fusion normally anymore either
it removes all the cutscenes, speeds up the elevators, stuff like that
you can shuffle sectors, changing where they are in the sector access
does it remove the Metroid Breeding area, or whatever it was called?
Who do I root for? You or Antiguy?
the only upgrades required are plasma beam, missiles, charge beam, and level 4 security lock
makes sense, that area was devoted solely to a cutscene/escape sequence
I like zap tap, since I am terrible at this game
the only thing down there now is the one item in the shinespark tunnel
eh if i was a big dum dum it would have been not awful
wasn't* but yeah it was nice to just get in a pape mindset again
Someone pissed on the sheets but he still needed his costume
KEKW that’s an accurate representation of lantern ghost
Hope seed isn’t too painful tonight
He got no spice in those dms
Those DMs be as warm as Goombario’s company in you pocket Kappa
Goombario being held hostage in crystal Palace likely
i love that shy guys change color when they stack
He does try to search for Goombario every seed.
bucket will be on the clouds
So it’s better to find bucket at this point
lol ch 7 is vanilla difficulty huh
like, i can understand having the boss cutscenes, but good god
I'm wondering if I should add traps 🤔
Oot Randos have the ice traps
But there is something rewarding about traps… even Goombario can be fake LUL
It’s pretty rare in the Oot randos.
Phantom seems to be of the opinion that the real goombario is as bad as a trap so I don’t think it’s effective for him.
its in spirit of snowman gift
Hello darkness my old friend, we have come to see the Goomba King again phanto274Smile
The cutscene is why this check is bad LUL
It has to be bucket at Laki so where in 7 is soil
double dipping ch 7 is dumb
Forced Double dipping crystal is terrible
Getting soil ends the seed while bucket prolongs it. Which one so we prefer chat? Kappa
My wallet is in pain but I’ve ordered most of the stuff i need to run MMZ LUL
haha can we help on this?
I just need to check the underside of my gamecube, i think some models don’t have a slot for the sd2sp2 card iirc
but something was skipped on accident bawkBlub
did u check  lantern ghost i was afk for awhile
Dis you skip over the vanilla dizzy stomp chest on volcano?
I wasn't here the whole seed this time sob
refund check? know u forgot that once
did we skip the ones in the sewer
*I have the stream muted btw*
You have almost certainly seen the Bucket
he's not submitting it so you can snitch it off
omf i think i know where it is
That’s right I do remember Bucket being seen LUL
Time for the salty run back seed#2 phanto274Smile
only thing i would change is losing xp from running
losing xp from running is stupid i hate it
idk why they added losing exp for running
i rather drop all my coins
all these ch 7 1s man
Where we headed? Ch 4 or 5
good seed u want the shop that RvPA had today
You’ve probably been asked a lot but what are async seeds?
Ohh nice, so this is practice for tomorrow?
Oh niceee got a lot of people for the league?
The developers will eventually have to deal with flaws in the rando as the league grows.
They should. The cracks will grow as more people participate
I had to vent in someone else's DMs about it
how many more flaws are there besides the obvious
because of things I saw in another chat I frequent
Seems to be issues that these issues make the rando take longer than necessary
beat the game as intended 4head
I NEVER EVEN PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE 2021\
Thai is the seed making it up to you
watch them change it to 2023 now (jk)
Adam accepted Goombario into his heart. That’s something not a lot of us are willing to do Kappa
People really aren’t willing to learn and grow
accept the game how it is damn
Guess that means I have to accept Goombario
Accept him and accept that he bad
I've been very tongue in cheek
Is there a way to get the seed that yall run for tomorrow? Like do yall post it somewhere? I just recently started playing them and wanna see how bad I am lol
DK64 OoT and aLttP have so many options to turn in and off. There are many different ways to play depending on how badly you want to punish yourself. Zelda games also have the crowd control thing which is insane.
yeah ill probably try it on my own later. Im normally busy around that time but just wanna see how i do
DK64 rando devs are pretty fucking cracked
and they're open to suggestions and such
Takes math skills to do that.
DK64 is a classic let alone the bananas rando
the rando for dk64 has actually been pretty fun
I like what they been doing with it
why do math when you can have a third of your time save in fights /jk
You really need to do vanilla
I love DK64. I used to force my cousins to play multiplayer with me
yea I've only played pape vanilla twice
im inexperienced at randos, but like watching the fightsi really
but you can get into the rando have fun still
(i am only half-joking, this is a callout to me, please learn how to do fights better)
The collectables are brutal in DK 64 because of the switching.
Rando fixes that plus is getting to the point that almost everything is shuffled
i've been practicing and i've been getting better at remembering the checks on my own but my fights are.  mmph.
They pretty much rando everything in Dk64
The worst thing to do with a fuckup is to dwell over it. Not fair to yourself when everyone makes mistakes.
they got the dirt patches and fairies randomed
I literally cant do less than full game
the logic doesnt make sense in my head
we'll say there's a reason i'm typically fed up by my fifth spirit and dnf most of my seeds ;;;;;;
less than full in this game isn't pleasant
just I got go mode whatever, no Bowser fight
On a separate topic my own FP is completely full. I had a good amount of Maple Syrup with the pancakes.
When you say out of logic, is that just because you dont have Sushi or some other reason?
i skip fighting bowser alot he just gonna get fucked up anyway
i try to push through to go mode but i'm usually just frustrated by hour four since my controller is not great lol
the weird thing is though I can't teach people how to rando
I can only give them advice
missing those ch7 block jumps for the seventh time in a row due to input lag is not a good time
ah and so it can be a "waste" to go to 5 since thats not the route it expects you to take?
Season 0 starts Feb 1 btw
ok, cause ive heard the "out of logic" statement quite a bit but never understood, so thanks!
i used to do LTTP races with a buddy of mine
You streaming those races? The ones you do?
I like watching people race against each other in randos
yea streaming will probably be involved
Andy is good to watch for aLttP
it can be hype as f
I haven't seen any of Andy stuff bawkBlub
I barely beat LTTP vanilla a month ago. So… much… traveling in the dark world
I think group size will depend on participation
I thought it on switch? Lttp
Question: who can join the PMRL? Sorry for rejoining late
Andy is a good streamer. Smaller is good. He’s in the 100 to 500 viewer range.
@pethanct01 my gift sub ran out heck
His friend Patty got banned from GDQ.
alttp was ported over to switch
called gdq out on their shit basicall
oh yeah they been shit lately
I haven't paid attention to it period
I could do the same with ESA but I'm keeping quiet
back to watching Limit break rpg then sometimes
Save Goombario and make him your only partner to use in battle
get goombario or beat extra bosses?
sorry dont mean to be blunt
fight anti guy vs giving him a candy?
Extreme settings… max trapd, jumpless and hammerless seed
it has to be something that doesnt add much time
Ah but wait! What if you checked the spoiler log for only certain checks like Yoshi kids and make it an incentive
Purchase all Chet rippo items for progressive
@Trevbonk we'd have to vet seeds so yes
depending on how the incentives work, wouldn't that tell you if those checks potentially have something?  (since if you didn't do it, you wouldn't miss anything key)
oh that shy guy up top, is it possible for him to get unstuck from the tree?
okay i was just wrong then today since i kept luring him out there + he'd lose me only to see me at the bushes and come back
I wanna restart my pc but there's a windows update....
Fuck it I'm gonna bite the bullet
I think I've had one cooking for 6 months
I'll see you in an hour o7
I am sad Windows 8 is gone
The grippers are out and about
And when it does we get supreme
I'm gonna keep submitting my shit to hotfix and praying lol
that's one way to avoid an encounter lol
What’s your go to order at Taco Bell? Chat I need your help
going somewhere else is my go-to
Doritos locos tacos supremes. Cheesy fiesta potatoes
Cravings Box: Crunchwrap Supreme, Soft Taco (sub beef for potato), Chips
[x] amount of chicken chalupas for me
I heard the Crunchwrap is goated
avoid baja blast at all costs
Is their hot sauce any good? That’s a dealbreaker for me tbh
host sauce is fine; get Fire if you want any kind of heat
I’ll do the fire sauce. I have a high spice tolerance
then you'll be fine with mild
that is, Fire is mild to anyone with spice tolerance
@ThreeWeenies if you have a high tolerance, fast food hot sauce ain't shit
I was also recommended a cheesy gordito? Crunch? I need validation lol
can't vouch. I've eaten taco bell, but it's not something I go out of my way for
for me, the worst thing at TB are any bean-based burrito
Ahh I love beans that blows @janitorbeav
sorry, I should have said refried beans-based. I typically sub the meat for black beans, and that's fine
their $2 burritos are fine though
when I worked at Chipotle, I had to tell people steak was our spiciest meat:
Me: 1. Why? 2. It's hot if you're a BITCH
So cheap it makes me question the quality fr LMAO
well it's advertised as $2, but in my area they're $2.79
Hey Phantom! So happy you're still live, now I can watch now that I'm off work! phanto274Hype phanto274Bless good luck also!
if you don't wanna break the bank, Taco Bell's fine
you can do worse for more money
heck, the cravings box is $5.99, and a crunchwrap is $5.49. Yet the cravings box is a crunchwrap, taco, drink, and twists/chips
Honestly tho, the quality at chipotle has been terrible as of late
Wendy's isn't bad for the $4/$5 bag
thank you! how's the seed so far? phanto274BLANKIES
A few years ago McChickens used to be $1
get 2 or 3 things from McDonald's is almost $10
YOU HAVE TO USE THR APP MAN
@ThreeWeenies what's so special about the app
same reason why I use the TB app. Can't get the cravings box any other way
is that why they pester about that damn thing
well they're just selling your data
these days who isn't selling your data lbr
who tf doesn't have access to my data
@buff00n yeah, it's a pretty lost cause at this point
I think I was most freaked out when my wife was pregnant with our first kid and before we announced anything and before we started doing any research or whatever you might normally do, Facebook was like, "Hey congrats, here are some ads for baby supplies"
depends on the data - some things can be kept secret, and it helps
@janitorbeav i would delete my facebook if that happened to me
I ended up going with a 5 layer burrito and the Crunchwrap LMAO
let’s see how my stomach reacts
@blacktiger51 I definitely don't use it on my phone anymore, and I basically check it once a week for family photos and that's it. I've also got it in its own separate cookie container to mitigate tracking. Weird part is that all this happened when I was using NoScript and Facebook was essentially in its barebones mode
WOW, this kombucha's doing it's job!
@janitorbeav there's been times I've THOUGHT about something, then it appears in my YT recommended or some ad
When can we all play among us
Golden Hammer? When'd you swap to Mario & Luigi????
They’ve made some fun updates and new game modes
I like using the John wick theme lol
Like, my character is a John Wick skin
I think you need a dip emote now
Pape Rando: The Search for Bombette
yeah, that's how deserts work iirc
Was this a required blue key seed? Have we been to crystal palace yet?
I love how partners close doors for you lol
I had to go, is this seed 2?
Bad for him, good for us. This has been good content.
what does the green toad and key mean before all the tracker stuff
oh, nice. if star pieces, does tm
was it hp+ for 1 or power plus? I'm slow
Losing exp is a bit of an extreme punishment for a small mess up like entering an avoidable battle
I think that you might not be behind then.
Remind me in 30 min when you are doing gk jcogDab jcogLUL jcogLUL jcogLUL
Will mega bomb be worth!? Let’s see
I doubt most people would have done it faster. Bombette is locked behind too much and too much is blocked by her.
Don’t get us too excited here
With that palette it’s basically just “guy”, nothing anti about him
I mean what is so bad about him. He doesn’t attack you. You attack him, he just wants to protect his treasure.
Laki is go mode right ?
Half an hour’s almost over jcogNote
Next stream you’re gonna hit 500 hours of total playtime for pape. What are we doing to celebrate ?!
how long has randomizer been out
Celebrate by playing more PMR?! LOL
It has in fact been 30 minutes
Blue key required seed!? Omfg lol
its also my wish i love blue key seeds
you'd think it would melt that ice
I do love the footprints in the snow
Lol I forgot about record after 2 hours lol
think i am gonna be sick
what the fuck what are you missing
is the race seed tomorrow one of the async ones? I would assume no
so ralph is based on how many chapters, not which ones?
I have learned so many things. sorry at your expense
tell that block to the one seed i had where rolf had parakarry after third chapter clear, who was blocking watt and bucket and frying pan, which had a fortress key
this was the seed of rolf
I'm a total noob and not good at games. but I always have to sleep between each section here for star points. one day I'll take the time to get better
it'll be the only part I watch this agdq
I watched LttP earlier, as fun.
but my interest in watching GDQ has waned in the last few years
I personally don't care for the prize segments :D
The only gdq I've watched is what I watched with you that one night lol
gdq just haven't been as good as it used too
Y'know if you did half the stars and used a cheating device you could get a 2:30
if you're not too tired, I'd be down to watch another phanto274BLANKIES
id love to chill with pepe merio for longer
i woke up at 1 30 pm today somehow
sounds like you needed the extra sleep today tiger
i usually wake up around 12 30
wake up strimmer ads are done
I'm eating some crackers, give me a minute
Oh 500 hours is hitting tonight !
i would never i was simply snuck up upon
on a scale from 1 to 10 do you think its time to go to bed tippiThink
Hey I'm new! how's it going?
If I don't teach you before then I'll def be teaching you wwsd rando when I move there
He can go to 8pm now
he have sunday school tomorrow  Kappa
I was at a party all day so Im late night man idk
Goddammit I didn't close my thing of corn bread all the way so my last 2 slices got stale >:(
Aww they might still be good for dunking in chili?
why would I add anything to cornbread it's already perfect
naw youre adding the cornbread to the chili lol
would you pick up goombario if u could sell him for 100 coins?
just chilling. Hope you're doing well
last seed was very fun Kappa
He really tried for it lol
So do you always start with this many partners?
I didn't know if it was a rando thing that allows you to explore
In the future, every seed will always start with Goombario. This is to make the rando more like vanilla.
I'm glad you said that because I was about to ask
I saw in the title. How does that work? Points?
you cannot use your bracket games for peril, bot
Oh yeah somebody was mentioning that in the BN server
I didn't read the whole thing because it's not really my area of expertise/interest, but it is pretty cool
All I want is an intro skip patch for 6
100%'d BN3, and I still can't tell you where everything is
True, but I've been playing a good amount of randos lately
would it be curlish to look up lotto codes for a BN rando run????
Yeah. Part of a challenge thing I'm dry running
or should/would those checks be where you're find the lotto #(s), in-game?
the stone could be in here
Are you doing the BN6 race tourney?
Supposed to start next(?) weekend and runs for a couple weeks
Last time I got concrete info was they they're trying to see if the JP community is interested
blackjack I believe, but idk if he does 6 or just 5
cheap shell shot is very nice
I feel that. Part of why I haven't gone back to them
But less to rng because yugioh likes to wring my balls
Train Arrow? I've been calling it Tri-Arrow this entire time. Oops.
I don't remember what I was calling it before I was finally corrected
It's strange that it's the only other instance of a required chip for progression
that's how I feel about BN4-6 in general. Some shit's just like, WHY. Why'd y'all think this was a good idea???
probably getting high on the job
BN2 stans refuse to forgive BN3 for not letting you hold 2 Styles
One thing I did like and wish they kept was buster counter
maybe it not a good idea to get the collection later this year phanto274Thonk
buster counter? wait, what was that
I kinda forget that MegaMan has a buster after my folder flows well
@buff00n From what I remember, it doesn't counter in the same way that it works in 4-6, but you essentially do the same thing with a charge shot and you get bug frags
I thought you were talking about a program
It has been a while so I could be misremembering stuff
We take wins when we can, lads
I guess they figured getting full sync off buster shots would've been broken
squint, I come back to see another seed
I think compromise could be made where you don't get full synch but you still stun
... but then, you get full sync literally for free if you're light in BN4, so......
Duo wouldn't be as big an issue if the bastard just got hit by AirHoc
my favorite DarkMega moment is when he triple deleted an encounter with LifeSword just as he was fading away
I still love the clip of Terra getting Pulverized by dark mega in 5
i need to watch it right now lol
@GoldenExperience PLEASE post the clip in chat
ooh, my favorite "WHY" moment in BN3: the fuckin time trials
@buff00n will do when I find it
"Can you crush these navis in a time limit w/ you EXTRA FOLDER????" WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME
(nvm that I deleted FlashMan in less than a sec cuz he walked into my lance, twice)
did laki use his cloud as a bathroom wtf
But I don't want to spam the channel
I'll just play it safe and assume they will care
it's better to ask for forgiveness than seek permission
It was piledriver, not pulverizer btw
what happened in the 2nd see
He went absolute apeshit and even styled on Terra
oh, NOW it doesn't wanna work
alright dude, gl on the runs. Have a solid night
we were playing some sea of thieves
almost lost the pokemon rando seed to a surprisingly accurate thunder jolteon
i pb'd any% by 14s after getting first try jr skip and early laki lzs
can't wait to run against this shit lmfao
gonna eat and lurk, hope the rando league goes well
what if frying pan is snowman's gift
i might have to actually learn race settings
2:30 AM here but can't sleep so screw it
which seed is this so i dont do it
I do, but its Sunday, and I have Covid :)
Its "starting" next Saturday, aka thats when we'll start asking people to schedule their matches
It was supposed to be this week, but I'm not running stuff while sick LUL
im just gonna steal your command thanks
You reminded me PM was one of the games I wanna learn, so maybe thats the main one I try this year
Also gives me ideas for other events to run :)
haha yeah it's an old ps1/dreamcast racing game where the courses are disney world rides
Tbh, the main thing would probably be to get the actual console LUL
I wanna go check that place ouyt
it's been a lot more fun than I expected! it's well made, and not just for a licensed game
Oh neat, do you typically go to the one in U district?
LUL that sounds like a fun day tbh
oof they're like $140 in los angeles :(
hoping my everdrive shows up in the next few weeks
when i got my n64 a few years ago, it had one with it
whenever I'm ready to get a SNES and a Genesis, I'mma try to get both systems from Pink Gorilla
oh wait! you noticed crystal dynamics on 102 dalmatians, right? they also did this racing game lol
they made pretty good licensed games haha
Would you rather have this or what you had last time
The mayor is holding laki hostage
this is gonna be a strong mario
Can you not get ultra boots and do that block on the mountain
I'm so glad I uploaded that badge to 7tv
lol how are the randos going
did you turn in all your 1 off shit
do you want me to tell
time to learn race settings el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
I did seed 1, PC went crazy all monitors when black sceen, but not the one I was playing on which screwed up my capture. This forced me to run OBS with the small audio delay. After I got all that back up the seed freaking crashed on me in the elevator room. Luckily I didnt have to fight Crystal King again. GL not watching. Cheer100
Internet went out for a bit, where was star stone/laki???
i forgot to mention, live splits crashed too
Of course it's also deathly ill shit laki
pape rando has made you a master of pulling Ws outta your ass
When does the League races kick off?
Congrats on the 500 hrs too man phanto274Gold
what sucks is, you can't re-run it. Gross.
Rando Randy sNeeders, rise up! onewin14Confirmo
so I had to rewatch the pape race, I'm like who the new dude who popped up haggThink
we be back for something famous last words   Kappa
you know that shouldn't happen again rofl
i just looked in discord looks good
i haven't even signed up yet
i do i just dunno if i want to commit to like 12 races or whatever
in addition to filling when the weeklies need it
joe was doing seed 1 last night and he game crash
is this text scrolling faster or am i losing it
is airbnb still worth it now
i paid to stay by myself the whole time and it was a bit chunky but
the proximity was well worth it
i think i'd be down for sgdq if it's in person
if it's in person, I might be there
i am the only person i know who did that
and it's bc i was alone
I was about to say, no one followed that lol
Such a tragedy of a seed. Let me know how seed 4 goes since the Dark Lord is following you around from the start LUL
the other group of ppl i hung out with started at 2
and then more ppl came streaming in
and there were like 8 at the end lol
there's 0 enforcement outside of the event area
im def going again if it's in person
if you volunteer and get accepted they'll refund your ticket so that helps
yea, i was too busy lol
i did donation tech, photography, and enforcement
which was really just asking people to wear their masks
anyway i was also doing wfh so it was a very bad idea
my hours were so fucked dude
more than one night i was doing midnight shift for photography at 11-3am and then getting up at 6 am to remote in to work
I'm too late to say something
i had a great trip but im not doing wfh again
just got here is every important npc going be purple
i need more friends to come so you def should lol
what days are the summer ones
im probably going to be heading right there from my sister's wedding
so imma crash a nap maybe, likely be back at the end or the start of new seed
I was watching the vod of seed 3, and it looked like watt glitches out while saving the yoshis. was I imaging things?
what day do you do weekly pape races
cause i wanna schedule pokpark race
ight so lemme pitch saturday to the masses
i want people to actually participate
that, watt didn't light up the room. that's normal?
gotcha. thanks, I'd never seen it before and thought she just didn't work
if someone's willing to shoot me in the face, I'll gladly take them up on that
oh so are the allowed tricks a thing for the league too
maybe 1 season lp skip will be allowed
no holds barred randos are fun
and by that i mean exactly what i know should be in logic
game trying spare ya with items
may cloud nine be with uou
had you leveled up once or twice with star points? level 7 chapter first is impressive
I'm missing a little while parenting
Just got here and see WeLoveGoombario
@grover53 damn kids. Needing things. It's almost like they rely on you
exactly! they keep asking for something called dinner, and it's just not ready yet
@grover53 WHAT? they want to EAT?
e ery day! more than once!
sheesh. sounds as needy as the puppies.
only one requires to be physically fed, so that helps
You stole their rain gauge D:
Did the Van guy from the race say why he left behind Mount Rugged in yesterday's race?
I bet Rosie probably would take the Pulse Stone if you let her...
You can beat 6 now, right?
I like how this seed is keeping you broke
What are you scared of a little cloud for?
Saved Goombario and left Kooper to die.
I actually did this in the first practice seed
A friend just messaged me, apparently someone they know got a rom of FE Engage and is playing it on their Steam Deck
Pyramid Stone was in the Lake and I also used Bombette
Wanted to say that I watched most of the race and it was good content. Good job on the commentary.
which switch emu are they using?
>I don't have the funds to get a switch
I'll never do it from an indie
I only do old games I can't get my hands on
Those are long out of print.
I'm trying to get interest into FE Engage
don't like how it looks but I ain't gonna pirate it
*sigh* what if it was important?
my feelings about FE series has been declining bawkBlub
they just ain't the same anymore
speedrunners ruining my fun. Skipping lantern ghost and that ever important chest.
Not like a chandelier will fall on you or anything
I agree, but I hate how many times I have bought minecraft
Three houses, more like zzzzz houses.
Fates Conquest story killed my interest in finishing Conquest
Fun activity: calculate game cost per hour vs movie ticket prices.
still bought them, but dislike it
THE STORY OF FATES WAS TRASH
i don't like tactical rpgs so i never got into fire emblem
Paying for a game is hella CHEAP
@keo314 Especially when you realize that game prices have only really increased majorly once. $50 to $60.
we in the day and age of where 60 hours + is common
I've been playing pikmin 2 romhacks lately, theyve been quite good for that
Still, 8 hours is .... $80 worth of movies?
I dumped +100 hours in Sonic Mania cuz that short ass game was fun af to warrant multiple playthroughs as multiple characters
I budgeted $20 and 2 hour movies
I'm for shorter games with "worse" graphics
NES was $50 as far as I know.
someone was looking at a 1990 sears catalog and a bunch of them were $70 used then
games are 90 bucks plus tax in canada
I win. I buy popcorn at the grocery store. I watch twitch. I sub when I can afford to (work breaks even). Even cheaper
@blacktiger51 depends on the game. I don't remember what Monster Hunter cost, but Factorio was $40. I have over 2k hours.
monster hunter world was like 69.99 when it was 1st out
so, $70 at 400+ hours. Not as cheap as 0.02cents/hour
no, that doesn't include tax, which varies by province
I missed it, what did you get?
5% GST, provinces with PST.... or HST.... more
depends where youre at, in ontario its 13%
7% PST? I haven't lived in Ontario or BC for a while.
I thought that was northern montana
I think it's 8% for me
Nope, we may be north of Montana, but they call us the Canadian Texas
alverta is 5%, BC is 12%, manitoba is 12%, new brunswick is 15% newfoundlands is 15% NWT is 5% nova scotia is 15%, nunabut is 5% ont is 13% PEI is 15%, quebec is 14.975% saskatchewan is 11%, and yukon is 5%
unless I'm messing with ps5 and I haven't messed with those
They have to do things their own way.
that was from Meet The Robinsons.
we don't have tax on food item if it a need so stuff like pop is taxed and stuff like milk is not taxed
Green Penguin Hank Schroeder was too busy looking at his rocks to check if the mayor was still alive.
Anyway, it still comes to hella cheap per hour cost even if you don't play for 2k hours.
most Colorado food is the same as well
did you feed drugs to your bot?
apparently I missed all of your chapter 3
eh do I dare see how much of FE engage was spoiled from people getting those stupid rooms
HA joke's on you! I don't have social media!
nah I'm not blocking that game. I saw the designs and got turned off
I was like go ahead and spoil me
Does twitch count as social media?
i stay off social media when there a game i want to play
the only game I want to play is Octopath Traveler 2
so I will leave around then
It's also garbage, without a doubt.
Poop. Then I have to revise my statement, or only watch youtube
i open twitch 1 day and it auto play the new gow game i was like no close
if your bot is going to be coherent, I should reward it
Was that a 5FP shell shot?
Ouch, who's MVP this seed. Bombette.
chance of train being in toy box?
Rooting for Train blocked by antiguy
oooo. I looked away and a lunar stone appeared!
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
I think he was with the star children
my day has been just watching star trek and switching between fusion rando and yugioh
just waiting on my dad so we can put together the home gym he got last week
I got to get the DVDs. Sucks it is not on Netflix anymore. What part are you on?
why is 2 not lit up?
they just got the defiant and are aware of the founders and the dominion
That's when the show starts to get really good. Season 3 is great.
You should be coming up on one of my favorite Garak episodes.
Would be wild if it was.
but ye, i do a star trek rewatch of the late 80s early 90s series, so TNG, then DS9, then Voyager
and on yugioh, i finally have built my blue eyes deck
missing 1 ch1 key, lunar, raven, miracle water, red key, and palace key aftert 3:30+
bruh, i played a game against a buddy of mine, had 2 blue eyes, plolymerization, a card i can use to get another blue eyes, and a throw away card i can discard
so i had turn 1 blue eyes ultimate
im about to watch your vod at doublee speed
I even did blue key checks
@axl_sr dis you probably skipped a shop
i checked those again just before I quit
Was that the second seed you did on Saturday, Phantom?
wasn't jade raven in boo library in seed 2
I remember you DNF the first one and went into that seed so annoyed.
I watched paper's race vodthe library?
I remember as well and I woke up at 2am to see him doing seed 3
You woke up as I went to bed. I got through as much as I could though.
Anyone else think they were trying to make Laki into a Leprechaun or zombie in seed 2 with his color palette? LUL
I like the one that makes him like his girlfriend palette
It’s actually good meme material if you see the potential in green Laki
The palette in this seed is good for him.
@Trevbonk He looks like he is in a perpetual state of air sickness.
because everyone knows you have to blow up doors instead of push.
@pethanct01 I actually kind of like green Laki
kind of reminds me of midas - them gold ice
These are the kind of seeds I see Gil practice with. Good to know he has a talent for rolling interesting seeds LUL
did he roll the one on peperace yesterday? it seems like it was ultra ugly too lol
Fun to watch horrible to play LUL
that seed yesterday was a mess
Ugly seeds are the best for content. Keep up the terrible luck.
Paperario the new kid in town is coming for you, better watch out
oh? how'd you get introduced to paper mario ?
Phantom we should grind xrd when I move there
Jibca keeps hyping up their anime game scene there and rollback for xrd is in 4 days
i played pape when i was like 6
i was like 6 or 7 when i 1st played paper Mario
I genuinely don't remember if I played 64 or ttyd first
then again, i was born the same year the N64 came out
I remember playing them both multiple times though lol
@WEEGEE666 oof. I feel ancient. My teeth might as well be falling out
TTYD was just a game my uncle gave us with the gamecube and my sibling bought 64 on wiivc so I just had both
i just had it i only remember how i got like 2 of my n64 games
I bought pm64 on launch day, not even knowing it would be a rpg or what a rpg was
@KagiStreams ttyd wasn't even out when I played pm64 the first time, what have you got to worry about?
I remember renting Paper Mario from Blockbuster
@Nekonayzz I think I have a copy I bought when they sold them
I played Super Pape and then Pape 64 on Wii U VC :)
same and then it was bought as a birthday gift for me Neko
yeah I wish I got it as a gift
I just remember buying it on Wii shop I think
i bought mine like years later once i had money at a old games store and it was jacked up in price ;-;
I sold my cartridge to gamestop for 15$
Then bought it on vc for 15$ a few years later
sometimes you just feel the fuck up
I get it a lot with window jump lol
That's why I just Parakarry, pie jumps too scary
i have never try to do that jump i know i am just gonna fuck it up
This is the fastest I've seen you do one of these seeds since Saturday.
I am confused by both of the last messages.
ex·pe·ri·en·tial /ikˌspirēˈen(t)SH(ə)l,ekˌspirēˈen(t)SH(ə)l/ Learn to pronounce adjective involving or based on experience and observation.
The bot is referencing that one weekly seed where Goombario was with the Yoshi kids and we discussed how it’s an experiment to see how often Goombario appears in 5
Axl forgot Yoshi kids and Phantom ignored them in that seed LUL
The bot makes sense sometimes Kappa
i might stay up all night and beat it
JCog really set a standard against Blooper.
I'll see if I can do that rofl.
I  gotta double check date again
how does the bot get it's phrases from? does it randomly read what we are typing and generate something?
One day it'll learn from me and you won't like that
So… the bot is becoming sentient?
I could just call off like a day or two make sure I'll beat it. I want that Krauser fight in there
We have to teach the bot to love Goombario.
Do I have good news for you
we can't teach it love now
we say bad stuff about Goombario
That was in my chat though he knows the audience he talks to
Guess the bot can be taught to live Goombario after all KEKW
Goombario is the best goomba in Paper Mario 1
only 1 Blooper fight is pog
Didn't have to fight Goomba King either in this seed.
go mode chapter 4 is lame i love this chapter
Go mode chapter 4 is a dream since you know that all your items are not in the check dense toybox
Bet you had Diamond stone in mind when you fought him considering what happened in the race.
go mode chapter 7 is a dream checking crystal palace  sucks
I love when the shy guys just pop
okay it's good time when he pops too
I say the best chapters and areas to go mode since they suck in having to double dip or check are 7, 2, Fortress in 1, and Tubba’s Castle in 3.
You forgot 6, you can skip almost all of it in go-mode
Dip into Crystal Palace for Storeroom key to find Bombette in Harry's shop
Go mode 6 is fast, but the checks are so close together I feel it’s quick to do them or double dip
remember that time when goombario was with bow and bow had goombario?
I jsut got spoiled as well, didn't know he was doing two seeds tonight.
I'd have to read instead of click and full screen then
now I'm panicking. I need to figure out dinner so I don't miss the start of the second seed!
which video was the one that got your PB?
do you have another life shroom?
peach got that coral blue #2 semi gloss lipstick from spongebob on
I missed most of the last hour, due to the kiddos
@grover53 you probably missed feeling old. They were talking about how old they were when games etc came out.
that was fun! How about another? :P
great timing Risch, I'm brb, gonna do another though
ooof bad timing. Ads then another run
yay im not cursed with the anti-timing
just in time for the start then popCat
He's doing one more seed, so sit tight, raid!
it'd be nice to see the credits change depending on what he did, aka no goombario, yes goombario, no yoshi, yes yoshi
just popped in from the raid. sounds like fun
sweet. I can see the run top to bottom then
Gil rolls some cursed seeds man. I have watched some of the worst abominations he played for practice LUL
this is a Raven approved seed
In one Practice seed, Gil had to double dip palace for bow in triple dip chest and come back with ultra boots for a tubba Key. In that same seed, 7 scaled general guy was required to beat first for weight just to get supers LUL
Yep that’s what happens with him a lot LUL
I wonder if plando will be possible one day. I know it depends on the coding and technical knowledge like that.
I bet you could just turn the spoiler log into a patch file
hey now, that looked like something (money)
It may or may not be a problem.
Yeah Koopa bros Fortress is forsaken out in the middle of nowhere
There are 2 FFs in this game
You're now obligated to use Slow Go.  You signed the contract. LUL
It starts out coherent, then devolves into two separate ideas.
Slow Go is just lonely sometimes.
Slow go is single and ready to mingle to lower someone’s Forward speed Kappa
I thought it was funny when JCog was near the mystery jar and some just says. Mystery Jar for the people?
@Trevbonk Exactly, Trev. You get it
Slowgo is a speedrunner's dream badge.
shoulda chucked that coconut in her fac-
The weird thing I hate about coming to 3 is that there’s not enough weight the boos can pull to make it a fun time unless you find the weight Kappa
Those doors are making me crave chocolate.
are there 3 or 4 checks in the forest?
And this cutscene for boo game is why they’re always short on fun ideas and leave everything forgotten in the basement Kappa
He was holding Sushie for ransom. The fiend!
don't let ch 5 be ch 7 scaled again
he only has progression up to #6, right?
I don't think that will affect this guy.
A man living in the sewers sells you a live fish, what do you do with it?
or is Sushi Actually Sushie? Kappa
These cutscenes are there to keep the integrity of the game.
The cutscenes were intended to make you remember past mistakes each time you got a game over in a fight LUL
As a kid, I actually learned and memorized Huff’s dialogue and cutscene after dying so much to him leveling only HP LUL
This seed is testing your resourcefulness.
This seed is testing his patience
I have a feeling what this is doing
Jungle fuzziness too much for me
Gave me redead vibes when I was a kid because they suck the life out of you. Also, being skin color is gross.
dont you have infinite money in toad town?
Money isn’t an issue when you have Goombario with his inside trading schemes
I didn't say anything but you completely ignored that first vine last seed
palace key.... TWO SEEDS IN A ROW
its funny how everyone comes into phantoms stream to bitcch about their seeds. I know im not the only one LUL
because I forgot to check the study in tubbas castle
oooooo, someone else streaming pape. Followed!
bowser tried to lightning me two times in a row at the end because I had no life shrooms
also two ultra hammer - super boots seed in a row
and two seeds in a row where palace key has hecked me over
Actually 2 abneyBolt , shield, then another 2 abneyBolt in succession abneyStare
you already have so many partners so early woah
also took me forever to just beat one chapter
i'm realy frustrated i can't do season 0. work is just too crazy for me the next couple months
it will give me more time to become not shitty tho which is good
The bot's response to Raven makes it funnier.
Seemed like it wanted to one up Raven.
I just wish I had the stamina to do more than one seed per day
go faster! then it's not as long :P
To be fair, there's also a big difference between 2 3-hour seeds and 2 4-hour seeds
i was curious how yo were getting through that room
only 4 more hours until Iori is top tier
Also the bot saying lol at the end of 90% of his messages is perfect
GL GL need to go run a work errand :(
we knew what it was this time
This is a Gil signature alright LUL
I just realized, there is no north shore in Louisiana.
yeah if you try to go there you might very well softlock NiceSoftlock
don't listen to the bot, it's lying
Wait there’s not North shore? I thought it was a north shore If you approached it from the south LUL
can you get ultra boots before super boots?
time to hit the bonus game
north shore is just a scrap area of louisana  Kappa
What did I miss, I wasn't paying attention.
do you have enough stars yet
just make it so mario doesn't drop anything
What if they just took the five coins instead of dropping them.
in a speedrun, the encounter is punishment enough. Dropping xp/coins is just a kick in the groin
i mean, at least it was all in volcano
I just realized my millia color in xrd is dlc
I HAVE TO FUCKING FISH FOR IT
what does soft locking in real life feal like?
Softlocking real life is like a nightmare that you are stuck in repeating
isnt an IRL softlock just sleep paralysis?
I say the closest thing to softlocking is regretting your whole life and everything
and restarting the level, midlife crisis
How do you reset a real life softlock?
You would have to redo everything all over again but the soft lock makes you regret the choices leading up to event of the softlock
Wait… you can just reset your softlock if you are an AI LUL
apparently i asked a very philosophical question lol
that wouldnt be a softlock then, itd be a hardlock or a crash
@weegee666 a question that no one thought about LUL
I'm doing good. Just doing marathon junk :D
The bot sure is being cheeky tonight
gotta run, y'all! good luck with the seed
You ever watch Kitboga, he has been training an AI to call scammers and waste their time.
He's worth checking out on here or Youtube. He just calls scammers all day while disguising his voice. The scammers get so mad.
There's a few "scambaiters" out there, but I like Kitboga quite a bit.
He's spreading awareness of a real issue. Apparently Americans have lost 6 billion $ in the last year to those scammers.
I’m used to the gray one
What an evil bastard holding ultra stone LUL
Goombario with the Ultra Stone PogChamp
I need the normalcy that the grey beanie brings me
When I firsst played this game as a kid, I spent so much time in the desert killing the pokeys and bandits.
I just liked the area. I still didn't know about that triple secret with the hammer hitting the fake block. Only new about the first hidden block there.
i had a guide book and i always had it open for the desert map
Wait, do u already have 3 keys?
i hammer that block 100 times tons of times
Yeah, you had 3 keys before you opened the first one.
What is vanilla off that block trio?
3 FP Power Bomb. You love to see it
I only knew about the one you get when you sleep in the inn.
the wiki says  Amazy Dayzee can drop jammin jelly huh i never knew that
I think I would rather have them separated.
It does have its own category though
That'd be a bit punishing to include them.
add oinks for true CBT rando
Coin block to justify the seed.
Any idea on where watt is
I didn't appreciate Watt's abilities until recently. Being able to attack while ignore defense is useful.
It’s possible that Watt is nuclear energy in the form of a mini sun. That explains the pierce Kappa
Toy box is also a really great dungeon. Spent a lot of time here just playing around when I was a kid.
Kind of funny that they just employ a random Toad to run the train.
They wanted someone who didn't ask questions.
How’re the fp costs for power/mega bomb?
Well, considering Ralph is a dog, I guess that works.
I better not say what pink lantern ghost reminds me of LUL
what does pink lantern reminds u of?
the clitoris off south park movie
Let the 69 Star points tell you what pink lantern ghost reminded me of Kappa
Casually passing up close call LUL
Exactly so much so that close call could wait
It shows the Koopa Bros deep motivation to trick Mario into hitting a fake block.
Now this scene has explosive potential.
I imagine this wasn't a hard decision. Two star points or spook.
Cooked up a legendary badge for the people.
This is a pretty brutal seed with all the backtracking.
Everything in Chapter 2 went down to a bomb soooo
Despite being Italian, I like my foods mostly basic in terms of toppings
speaking of Mediterranean food, I was finally able to order greek today
First gyro in like 2 years
Vanilla means this seed lacks direction and taste LUL
somehow I doubt we are going to find watt anytime soon
@Trevbonk But it could also mean that it's the most neutral.
P down D up is always the play Kappa
Who needs power when you can have defense. Kappa
and we have a vanilla looking flavored Huff to rub the miracle water in LUL
I've been considering playing this casually for the first time. I've played TTYD, but never the original
That's what I hear. I enjoyed TTYD quite a bit, so I don't see why I wouldn't like this one
Goombario instead of Goombella and really wink Smadge
Plus I don't jave to play with oddly busty ghost Kappa
I haven't seen low cost power bomb in a while, until this seed
ok well that feels like a gimme
Does glitchless do partner damage or mario damage I forget
Kooper has a fire shell tho
I like Fire Shell as a concept
I used ms mows almost exclusively in my casual play through for the piercing damage
But her hat is less cool
I forgot about the log lol for a second
whos the goombario (useless) in TTYD then?
i was sad when flurry was introduced :( I enjoyed Bow so much
Flurrie is literally a living Gust Bellows
i can't wait to see you lead all those punis glitchless
It's not a glitch it's a feature
It's how you're meant to play chapter 2
just you know, we didn't need to fight them
We don't talk about Chapter 3
i enjoyed chapter 3 on a casual run, but I can def see how in speedrun it's annoying
Charlie is a hero for selling slow go
Charlie, my best friend who never sells me Mega Rush
Charlie just wants to sell slow go is all Kappa
no one wants his stinky Slow go
Weight being there is salt on the wound LUL
It's like watt, but in a shroom
I have an idea… Goombario please give us a hint
Wasn't there a Dictionary in a shop?
All it does is beat 4 and Yoshi kids
just broke as f in the beginning
I turned on smash and was confused as fuck as to why "Brown" was the p1 name
I haven't actually booted up the game on my own switch outside of events
Since before the arcadian in october
My music mods got fucked up somehow the mixing is out of wack
kbf key is gonna be deep in 7 jokehoSucks
welp i'm gonna head out, gl on the rest of the run!
The seed just couldn’t let it go and give your fortress key. Now you have to search all of 7 for the fortress key
how was the ghost pepper sauce?
You should go on hot ones
the only thing spicy i have by me is ghost pepper chips
sign me the fuck up for that
okay, but did it taste good
How long did you let yours soak
I gotta cook up some sichuan food soon
I'm down for spicy, but it better taste good if it's gonna burn my tongue off
i'm so pathetic with spice but i agree ^
gotta love when chain restaurants make "mega fucker burn your ass off spicy" burgers only for it to be cayenne pepper LUL
had a friend who couldn't stomach BBQ sauce. it was too hot for them
You should consider doing the blazin challenge
cayenne is the salt and pepper of spicy
Lurking but I just wanted to add to the spicy conversation and say the 2 ghost pepper foods I had weren't ghost pepper
I throw garlic pepper, cayenne and black pepper on stuff cuz I like the aste
Did you do the one chip challenge at all?
I'll do it with you if you get it after I move
I love spice but that is the one thing that genuinely punishes me
I know someone who failed the one chip challenge because she ate hot chips 10 mins in saying 'that wasn't bad'
@RuneRavenFP didn't you almost die that time he cooked for us
Like it's hot, yes, but the stomach pain is what gets me the worst
ngl, I do want more of Phantom's cooking
last check palace i am calling it
Phantom that ghost pepper scared me loool
good food tastes even better when I'm not prepping it, or paying for it
you ever gonna play with the reaper?
just mmake a road trip Kappa
Safeway haven't been to 1 since i live on the west coast a long ass time ago
oh yeah that doesn't exist here lol
i use to live in bc a long ass time ago i live out east now
gonna assume that's a "Jewel-Osco", ie Grocery & Drugstore
I was thinking mailbag but didn’t want to say it LUL
it's okay I live in the one state that everyone meme on
May as well pick up the weight for 100% tracker completion
I had a friend who somehow never heard of an italian beef
ok that's why I heard it
Never heard of Italian Beef on the east coast
Yeah i live in that area so
The world outside the midwest must be cruel
the only reason i know of it then
Jesse said he found a portillos in like cali or some shit
it's in Michigan but people acting like I'm going to Detroit or w.e
phantom you didn’t get it dipped I bet
Sichuan is where it's at. I promise it won't dissappoint.
I don't feel a kick out of that
tbf, I mostly get burgers, chili dogs or chicken sammiches > italian beefs
when the last time I had a good chili dog :(
Portillos has a good chop salad
a singular text mod that just makes Kooper say 'are you fucking kidding me' here
@brotherbluto I was thinking the same 😂
you reminded I need to get that shit when I'm paid
it's really dragging it out isn't it LUL
you didn't get the kbf key yet oh no
so I'm convinced to make chili dogs tomorrow
fuck now i feel like i have to go to Sonic tomorrow and get a chili dog
I need me a good chili recipe
I'm trying a new Chili recipe
oh neat, I'll look at it
when I worked at Chipotle, my coworkers look at me like I was crazy cuz I ate whole ass jalapenos
i hate the taste so much
@buff00n They had never seen a hero before
I like the C R U N C H
i'm such a baby when it comes to spicy
oh you mix in cinnamon in chili? coolio
Ok I hit a 0 to death on ohrocks I'm derusted
Who says bell pepper are spicy LOL
a white woman at work has said a red pepper was spicy
Have they eaten a Red Bell Pepper?
I use Red in my stuffing
I just love all of them but they aren't spicy >.>
Am I a red or green bell pepper
I use red or green for omelets here and there
I would say you a Green
@ThreeWeenies you're red, on my screen
that's why I gravitate towards jalapenos. I like the taste.
probably my most hated pepper is jalapeno
Every salsa with jalapeno in it I've had has been tasty
I always thought it was the seeds that make peppers spicy
There’s a mango habanero moonshine that gets made in Virginia and it’s soooooo good
That’s what Anthony Bourdain taught me as a kid lol
apple pie moonshine has been my favorite moonshine thus far
alright I actually gotta slep, you guys have a good night!
damn, we're missing the "Mikey" Koopa Bro.
Troopa should've shown up as a bonus boss in a later Paper Mario
God I forgot how satisfying waft was
I be shittin and they die
yo? he's showing off his RAC?
He was doing mario and luigi earlier
is there a warehouse skip? if so could you point me in the right direction?
This stream is sponsored by RAID: SHADOW LEGENDS!!!! RAID: SHADOW LEGENDS is an mobile game that's super awesome and it awesomes all over the mobile game competition having over 1 Bajillion downloads on the app store. RAID has a bunch of heroes to select from and if you sign up now, you get a free 9 star hero that breaks the game!
W'ee gonna be in the shadows raiding like legends
RAID: SHADOW LEGENDS? more like RAD SHADOW LEGENDS because this game is RADICAL!
wario is normally loud so it's normal
wario is a good jumpscare in my Mario 64 copy
I want a Mario 64 copy with RAID: SHADOW LEGENDS™
monadoButt Guess who I got I gift sub to btw
I'm about to pay to win through raid
I'm in class so I hafta leave actually but good luck
i feel very stinky about what i dif
😔 I need to finish my comms and zines but I do want to do animated emotes
in and out in an hour i promise
you use a raphnet to gc for pape right? if so you should look at #speedrun-help real quick
classes started today and it's gonna be a long ficking semester
the bots a zoomer, #'s are outdated
make a Wind Waker OST tier list
can we talk about "AAAAAAAAAAA" though?
are these seeds using the regular race rules?
wait I just saw weed Mario in the bottom right just now
I hope it works with the download and account stuff and everything. I‘ll go try
but that was the best part phanto274Cry
do i need to use the code?
Gosh, I really need to set up a carrd
koopa village block is like power rush i bet
how far do we need to get?
I think my wifi is gone lol
I got it downloaded on my phone though… old Account, can’t use anymore pepeHands
ahh that what i was thinking since u said it out of logic
I don't know how to make the lobbys
but where do i use the code?
i have it on mute i check it sometimes
Hmm, no thanks. I prefer to be pretty chill
When did you mirror your webcam
That fuzzy wanted you so badly
Also depends on the seed. With fp costs differing, that gives different partners opportunities to shine.
idk why they said that as a suggestion lol
Oh man this is a fun thread to read lol. Gl btw
Getting rid of cut scenes is the elephant in the room and they are focusing on the mice.
you know there's a bunch of cutscenes in this game
kooper puzzle make chapter 7 hammer locked
So I get a drawing block out for the first time in months and get a paper cut right away Madge
It’s exactly because they’re thin and deep
they better let us cheat in race settings
Doesn’t mess with core gameplay. DK64 allows the player to swap kongs on the fly. Could you imagine going to the kong barrel to switch kongs in a rando. Nobody would play it.
Every katana strives to be a sheet of paper
in glitched logic that make chapter 7 hammer locked that what i mean
He says after just picking up Kooper
m4, i have a name wtf
I didn’t realize how much i hate the mayor and his wife until I started watching your channel. Save the timr, not the penguins.
you should joint he pmr league
if you do i will too
Did you see the new dragon dude in arknights CN? He’s constantly talking while deployed and this girl reminds me of that lol
i haven't played pape rando in like 4-5 months
and i'm trying to move soon LOL
there's plenty of time to schedule matches :)
That cut scene made me angry as a kid and having to relive that everytime i watch a rando… ugh
BabyRage I gotta move first before I make any commitments D:
i think the league is the chance you were lookin for to play in a way that's more attuned to your schedule
i think rigby said he was doing it
been waiting 4 days for them to call me back
When is the league? Early spring?
and by that i mean i just wanna speedrun vanilla
Really? That soon? Prime 2 Rando tourney should just be wrapping up by then
the only time ive played rando in months except for the seed you redeemed phantom was when pape races needed a fill
i think those races would be a great time
my free time situation is complete ass rn however
i tried oot rando and i have seriously been spoiled by how fast you move in pape
it felt like it took so long to get anywhere
Sushi’s parents naming her sushi is like if my parents named me chopped human.
Didn’t sushie name her daughter sashimi or am I making that up
Your average everyday Volcano first-clear seed
i should do a pape rando tonight
what flags are y'all using for league
That reminds me, I know what I'm gonna stream on April-Fools day
I think I will do one tonight too
@captainmd13 He did a level 7 volcano first seed last night
I wanted to do Goat Simulator 3, but that's an Epic exclusive so I have to improvise (Just haven't gotten around to the Epic store yet)
it's settled, imma do a pape rando tonight
are you still streamin super late
Alrighty, time for me to lurk and cook
That was meant to rile up chat
that'd be my start time yeah
that's why i havent been seeing you much lately lol
that's the only time i can do it
i have to be winding down for bed by the time you're online
it's ok though it only goes thru late feb/early march
@mx_four Also, happy to hear about your new gig.
a 1 fp power bomb. pog
yeah super happy for you m4 <3
ill be back degenning in march
i might not be working for a while after that bc of pdq2
i should be moved into a new place within the next couple weeks
It’s true, Sushi does have a daughter named Sashimi.
and then if sgdq is in person i'll be going to my sister's wedding and then sgdq and then one of my best friend's weddings
waiting for the app to clear
ice don't tell them how you did your opponent in that gdq race
does that mean we getting m4 face reveal?
my appearance is not a secret lol
oh i'm going to GDQ 100%
i'll do unthinkable things to make SGDQ work out
well its a secret to me
Is that actually a person. Audioblood
i didn't think you were here, i didn't mean to light up your screen lmfao
the one slap from Bow always feels so bm
LA traffic at 4 pm be like
It’s just a car with a bouncing cage
partner move shuffle would to that
i wanna see gombario use shell shot
Goombario already has that. What do you mean? Kappa
You're already on Cloud Nine when he tattles.
my goombario's going back in the box
meant to add that but I was in a Go Raid
lp is the type to say 'bg' and then spike its controller in response
NO. BG. IT IS VERY HOMOSEX THAT YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY WEAKNESS. DIE.
keep dropping the super cancel off the dash punch
It is about a spot inside a volcano, so it being a hot topic makes sense.
im not over lopez calling rhuff a 'rowfling'
It feels like the community has already collectively agreed that it's acceptable to deviate from vanilla, so why this specific hang-up?
Vanilla is great but it's nice to try new flavors every now and then
I'm so glad we don't have to play through the opening cutscene going through Peach's castle and what not
i have definitely reached the point where i don't care anymore
i'll just play it and get good
if i feel like its fun
i think it's prob time for me to start trying to metagame the logic
i mostly just run around and do everything
Hello Mr. 5800. What I don't get is why they don't give the option to change those things. Doesn't have to be mandatory if they don't want to.
They still shouldn't be stubborn about that though because they are making something for a community and want to attract watchers and players. Cut scenes do not help retain people.
i do gk for exp a lot lol
if the time sink to exp ratio is good
Did Goomba King get poisoned or something? Sheesh
I don't remember the yoshi cookie. What's it good for?
Boshi is not in this game.
So tell me about the league stuff phantom
I signed up, can't wait to get slapped
How long you think the league will go for?
The only downside is, I'm being asked to join the Z1R tournament
I agree bot. I wouldn’t do that until 5%…we’re taking HP, right?
So are you planning to do like, 3-4 seasons a year?
I'm curious how it goes. Surprised there's no timing requirements, just "don't lie"
I mean, the cheater is gone
But from what I've heard, the flags they've been discussing are 100% dogshit
Are you trying to kill the community?
I think its the buff that lets him do it
No one would join that shit
Which is the worst thing possible
(I’m on a long delay while cooking)
that'd be sick and help motivate learning new tricks :)
it's way easier to say "I need to learn one trick" than "I need to learn ten"
Yo? Can we get a blockbuster Mega Quake too?
But I like Ruins Jump phanto274D
But the switches are green and red, clearly it has to be solved
wait i forgot races have big chests have hammer and boots
I don’t even play rando like that but fuck that super hammer room LUL
When I was a kid, I mostly used Bombette in early game, Bow in MId game and Sushi from ch5 and on.
Parakarry was my favorite when I was a kid
It would be like requiring you to get the "2-3-1" hint in deku tree before being allowed to fight gohma
So stuff like the statues in ch7 before ck
You know what time it is
it's time to support Phantom time orange188Comfy
Parrykarry also got used a bit, I would swap between those four and I didn't appreciate Watt's greatness as a kid.
@orangeisborange Thanks for the gifted sub!
@orangeisborange Thanks for the gift sub!
Trevbonk didn't get one either, unlucky
Dodging gifties just like I dodge PBs
Thanks for the gift sub iceblueLove
the linger sand fucks with me so much
My matrix powers weren’t strong enough wtf
given your name that is surprising
We have quite the crew here
yea I keep frogetting to renew mine LOL
I can't wait to do a seed tonight and it take 5 hours
Cause I forgot how to kill bosses
Arm broken in tragic train accident at Mt Rugged
And go to Fogo de Chao
im down to burn my entire wallet again
Does your fogo de chao have
I ended up doing the race seed from Sunday and actually would have had a pretty decent time even with a lot of mistakes. I did it in about 3:45
Just got my report card and I passed all my classes
Got 1 more semester to go
Wish I only had 1 semester left of classes phanto274Rage
@Risch thats the thing you see behind the counter at a bank
An adult is a person who is cool?
Apparently they have their lives totally together but idk about that
I saw. Thank you to the sniper (the only time I'll ever say that in my life)
aight one more then I'm gonna lab billy
I thought emotes were sorted by newest lolol
Ive been subbed for 3 months max
Just realized Ive been subbed since I was 16
You can make 17 = 3 somehow
Those tasty 8FP costs for Bombette
This is what we call improvising
ye short hopping and having actual confirms and I'll get there
I feel like I can feel out the neutral p ez
How could you interrupt our jamming
No bulli the koopers strimmer  pls ariasy1Confuzzled
4 coin star piece goes pretty crazy
Even if this were chapter 7 scaled, I think we 2 shot them??
that's a weird way yo get gems
✧ヾ(〃^∇^)ﾉ *:･ﾟ✧ the sun is back! …and Lily is still gonna die ariasy1Embarassed
Welp, have fun full-clearing your game looking for Palace Key
So these are async seeds, are we „racing“ someone then?
A little more direct than vanilla, eh
Oh good Rose is not only important, but also annoying!
Oh these flags have shuffled letters?
If no 1 shot, I'm leaving
Why dosent eh fight you like a man
He sits on his little post like a merd
Dark Koopas are such pains normally. It’s cathartic to see them get destroyed ariasy1Seemsdeece
I find it funny how smug bow is 24/7
Yeah, but Bow is a good character and fun to battle with.
The same way Mario jumps on them, by making contact
It was funny seeing all the racers getting tossed out of Tubba's in the race.
It baffles me to this day how well that Mega Rush badge is hidden. What a good secret ariasy1Seemsdeece
IS THIS THE LEGENDARY HIT GAME RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
I think someone wants to talk to you
So is super blooper a girl?
You fel... you know what, nevermind
I feel like it has been there recently
I remember one time a room in cpt 6 had palace key and red key or something like that
Give me a heart attack that’s fine
I'll know more about the Pape league then
If the flags stink, I'm not joining
Are they considering doing cooperative seeds. Two people working together to complete seeds and sending each other items.
After you put the scarf and bucket on the snowmen
I've seen it on aLttP and OoT
I will eat ice cream anytime
Now what would YOU do for a klomdike bar
Lactose intolerant people don’t need ice cream
Risch we can take a selfie and send it to Phantom
If we went got ice cream
As someone with a terrible stomach I can speak tp that
That's a risk I'm willing to take to make you jealous
Its almost gone now, its been a week
Just a week to go…or something
I'm surprised I got it this year and not last year tbh
Last year I literally had drinks with someone on the last night of the event, and they tested positive after LUL
I hung out with Slackanator at SGDQ 2022, and he tested positive 2 days later
Also with the cold discussion from earlier, I live in socal, we dont do cold.
Watt casually chilling in Bowser’s castle
I heard Rhonda Rousey in this game is that true
it was so bad that the power went out for my entire school district
And they didnt send us home
Oh yeah Phantom did you see
What I tweeted a bit ago
what if i sacrficed the transphobe for a dog
My AGDQ run held the 8th highest CCV the entire week
Like I was incredibly shocked that my niche game was that popular lol
I need to find some more time saves
So I can get a 33
This is probably my favorite song in the game? Maybe Star Hill is higher…mmm. Tough choice ariasy1Confuzzled
This is the best song in the game by far IMO
Cheer100 Santa Clause colors plus Golden Crown is best Crystal King combo. But he's dead now. Rip.
Needs a Scrooge color scheme for Mario
I don't even know what that'd look like
XD I just noticed 69 is FX C, I don't even need to play it to remember what that one sounds like.
I thought Watt was a miniature ball of nuclear energy disguised as a mini sun LUL
Is she the only little sparky in the game?
I mean, technically there is a letter from Watt's Mom, but that's off screen.
I did not realize she was a sparky. Of course she is. Why is she the only one.
Lil Sparkies were in SMW too
So was she put in the lantern at..."birth"
What would I even call it
Oh but also, Amps suck, and Sparkies should come back
So Lantern Ghost is a child abductor. He looked like one anyway.
I guess the frying pan evolved into an air fryer LUL
He's the Grinch to Crstal King's Santa Claus colors.
And now he's dead too, Rip.
2 and a half hours in and we’re finally getting caked up
I'll laugh if Watt is Vanilla flavored today.
i think i know where watt is
The bot had great timing there.
@Pallos7 He was on the fuzzies.
i've gotten that bully dude twice
So there's more than one child abduction in this seed.
But Phantom is only saving one.
Anti Guy looks like a Gingerbread Man! XD
hello mr Phantom (2*2*2*5*5*29) how is the async going puffy7Peek
just need watt im assuming here
Because it was behind Goombario Fuzzies? I'm guessing?
WATT-ever could they be hiding behind YEP
I'm a believer in vanilla watt
If it is we can guess the thumbnail for this one.
Boo is broken in this fight.
why doesnt mario just use a fire flower for light
You are your own dark lord
Why does Parakarry, the largest of the group, not simply eat the other party members
Imagine if Watt was behind Goombario all along. graham42Lul
I heard Ronda isn't very supportive of the dark lord
The fuzzies are two checks, aren't they?
Goombario was on the fuzzies, apparnetly, and juding by that tracker, that also means Phantom didn't get that item in Koopa Village. I really hope that isn't Watt. XD
arent fuzzies technically 3 checks (unless you just went behind kooper's house and dipped)
well me and zaroth are friends i guess
Would be funny if his hatred of Goombario led to him not getting Watt.
the enemy of my enemies are friends
Imagine if mystical key was rando too
see they should edit the logic to make it that goombario is always in checks required to access other checks YEP
Can I be a shrek dog?
You think watt could be with rip cheeto
so missing watt aside... how have things been with this run? Just got home :P
honestly very interesting to have a partner be whats holding you back from go mode
Where is that Sassy Lost Child?
Mighty Dark Lord do you use bears or other scary animals?
are you gay Mighty Dark Lord?
you really don't want to pick up goombario do u
You gotta feed the staff guy dogs and shreks tom make him stop dying
This is the stuff of nightmares
i actually had some weird dreams of Goombario last night in my sleep LUL
What's up with those messages in the top left
I am going to have some dark dreams after seeing this
can't believe Goombario kidnapped Watt like that
My worst nightmare has been seen before my eyes
i wonder how many people skipped this when going through this seed lol
These seeds love to include Goombario and I'm here for it
the whole seed i had a feeling that check was something
I will not forget Pixel Mario room ever again
I will not forget Pixel Mario room ever again 󠀀
I will not forget Pixel Mario room ever again LUL
Gil has Evil Goombario as an emote for a reason… Goombario invades his seeds a lot LUL
You missed Phantom being forced to get Goombario. It was great.
I could probably do it again and do better
Is being a dark lord free to play
Phantom right now: "Maybe if I don't put Goombario on the tracker, it will go away."
where did Watt end up? I
Up on block in Koopa village.
He didn't get it because Goombario was being held by the fuzzies/
should I retry the seed later? Or just let it go? Later as in like tomorrow
What were you doing at 1000 yourube subs again?
thanks. had to make sure my kids allergic reaction wasn't ER worthy
Pretty coherent. This bot is becoming better.
Dark Lord is my imaginary friend
This seed is enough to make me rage too
The dark lord lives in a house?
Where is their armor dark lord?
I even did crystal palace blue key checks to make sure LUL
Dark Lord Siroth wearing my jeans
This seed is just pure trash
This seed is the perfect blend of vanilla, chocolate, and with a slight hint of strawberry
Use AI to make your vtuber model
They stopped airing those because the Dark Lord adopted all of those dogs
yup it gonna get alot of use
Are there circuses in RAID SHADOW LEGENDS because there are a lot of clowns there
Hopefully there is a 99.9% chance that we don’t have to deal with the Dark Lord again
Makes sense pink lyrics for pink bow
actually that’s kind of good For Rowf to have those there since you can just enter 6 anytime after finding the other seed
This is looking like a Rowf seed already. LUL
@scrambleddragons because he is holding the seed hostage Kappa
Google show me the Dark Lord Siroth
Kooper was trapped in the Toy Box
Was that two bubble berrys in this room? XD
So that’s what volt shrooms do
"Give her some of those magical beers" -Dark Lord Siroth
Hey look. Volt Shroom found a use in this seed
Can't you also summon Dark Lord?
I mean how did you get all of those shreks
Can I get ronda at the hot tub stream
Two turtles and a ghost walk into the forest
Have you watched any other non shrek movies by dreamworks?
Persona is a rip off of Shrek if you think about it
They want you to play fair
They want to to invest in Goombario instead Kappa
Did gil play through all these prior?
We need the human Shrek vtuber model
But last seed is definitely something he  rolls quite a lot LUL
Just like the scene in Shrek 1 where he rescues Fiona
Good thing you have been saving up
Merlow, why you holding Bombette for ransom? LUL
Because Goombario instructed him to do so
Why has no one questioned the Dark Lord's gamer status?
I need water. My mouth is on fire.
But I have dinner, and you're my movie!
the 1C crushed chilis + 3 Tbsp crushed chili powder (and other things) I cooked my chicken and onion in
The seed is already entertaining :)
Was that a walmart brand log I saw?
was he playing out of the game
was that the game you were talking to
once you get to know him than he's so bad
what is this scaling? randomizer scaling.
Vanilla but they changed the ingredients
@runeravenFP I need you to wipe my memory of last seed for me. WeHateGoombario
what's gated behind the star pieces?
Raven, you wanna know what happened last seed?
What’s bad for you is good for us
Goombario was on fuzzies, Phantom skipped Goombario, Watt was on block in Koopa Village locked by Goombario.
WeLoveGoombario kinda reminds me of Jebaited
That's it, in a nutshell. XD
Oh wow, is this really gonna be all Vanilla chapter difficulty seed? XD
I hope it is all vanilla difficultly
Also the bot @'d jokehow in my chat
I forget what the message was I just remember @jokehow lol
He @'ed someone with the name of blood in this chat. The guy happened to be watching too.
@ everyone youtube subs are free! go do what the coherent message says!!
what has 2 thumbs and is not a guy?
I wondr how succeptible this boss is to sleep stomp? phanto274Shrug
Seeds like this separate the men from the boys LUL
Good thing you had those snowman dolls.
So you just beat the final boss right?
Bro you should need bombette here
Hey phantom! hope streams been good
I just realized what exactly Phantom menat before about the Discord
in your opinion what's the worst chapter 7 scaled boss?
I'm honestly tempted to pick this up.
I wonder what happens if you try to use homeword shroom during the escape sequence?
4 and 5 when they are 7 scaled and required to beat first are bad
You can get Ultra Boots pretty early this seed, huh?
my players killed an adult white dragon
Thanks for sparing us the Mayor Penguin and his evil wife.
Penguin wife is the type of person that would be on an HOA board.
I live in one and joined the board for a year to try and make them less abusive to the neighbors. That didn't exactly go according to plan.
I'm tempted to save up the 100,000 points and request Super Mario RPG.
dumb question but does the partners you get later in the game have any dialogue for early scenarios like this?
I believe Prologue reuses Goombario dialogue, ch3 has sometimes custom dialogue and sometimes no dialogue for later partners
so can you use his tattle on map? or is he just doing nothing but following you?
Bows like "shit thats my house"
I mean, there is a setting where you can use overworld abilites without them, but Phantom doesn't play on that setting usually.
What's the point of getting them if you can always use them
this is a pretty silly mod
I reccomend checking out the randomizer site Colonol, it's a lot of fun to try out.
I feel like those 2 being the same item in rando will always be funny no matter what the item is
Imagine if Bubble Berry was required for Laki again. XD
I know that the fast text is better. but I can rarely tell what items are.
Whelp now dipping palace is in logic
what does this guy normally give you?
oh wow this mod skips quizzes?
Those + 1 Life Shroom and 1 Repel
Basically, there's a randomizer site where you can choose your settings and completely randomize the game, there's a lot more settings than what Phantom is currently using too.
You can randomize things like Letter Rewards, Star Piece Panels, Koopa Koot Rewards, and other stuff too, but only if you want too.
so im guessing the item limit is extended?
is this the seed with 7 bp last stand?
Unless you add item pouches, a new item which increases your item limit by two.
So this rando I only seen you do three glitches. There aren't many glitches in this overall, correct?
the craziest thing on the discord is when people get upset that quizmo just gives you star pieces. they WANT to do the quizzes ??
We have the occasional pulse stone ASMR pulses this seed Kappa
oh wow so you can find partners out in the wild as well?
@AudioBlood Sounds like some real characters.
are you automatically given speedy spin
Gross, the quizzes are awful to watch though.
at least that makes SOME sense lol
same with the enemy hp badge, since chapter difficulties are randomized
@audioblood are they even suggesting like have Quizmo give items or just plain demanding quizzes?
wait so you can also throw out any item at any time?
was that in the OG game?
I did know about peekaboo. constant speed is helpful
There are also some joke settings which no one takes seriously that much. Like starting with no boots so you can't jump at the start.
I feel like it's a glitch, same as Parakarry clipping up the stairs in Tubba's Castle, but what do I know
Not knowing enemy HP was something I didn't like about SMRPG and Paper Mario. At least this game had Peekaboo though.
@MarioManTAW it is a glitch, nobody says it isn't. it's just very easy and doesn't save much time anyways
I remember using hammer throw as a kid to deal with the bats. It hyped up the badge so much for me ever since
SSS is totally not a glitch dont worry about it
GHE also just clever use of mechanics
ok but punies get a pass cuz fuck punies
There is an argument in both ways towards the banning of glitches. On one had, glitch banning makes the rando races more accessible to casuals, but on the other hand, those people can learn the glitches.
aww you're not gonna hit this block for 3.7 years or something
did they do that for the other things that has that weird stipulation?
Definitely broken when you can just get Laki and say, time to beat 1... and 5...
im the artist formerly known as parakarry
Can almost beat 4, just need 2 whole partners for basically just the boss
@colonelmendosa I saw an episode of the muppets on YouTube with Prince. The opening sketch was him trying to explain his name to the security guard.
I think it was th 90's show since Prince was "the artist formerly known as Prince". It had Kermit and those guys.
there was a muppets show in the 1990s?
i know there were a bunch of disney muppet movies in the 90s
but a show? i dont fully remember
huh so the muppets even got prince
simpsons couldnt even get prince back then
Link is to the episode I referenced. Copy link and watch after this guy beats the seed.
I have to head out now, goodnight everyone!
cause apparently prince was one of those guests they tried to get after that michael jackson episode
Oh shoot, it's late, when did that happen? raysL
Being forced to dip 7 sucks especially palace
I'll probably stick around another 20 minutes or so then I'll need to go to bed
@colonelmendosa I like Prince way more than Michael Jackson. Prince didn't touch kids.
tbh i never even think i heard prince's music in my life back then
even in the 90s i never heard anything by him
Same, I just got into Prince last year
Condition of the Heart is one of my favorite songs by him. I grabbed the albums around the Purple Rain era.
only time i technically heard anything by prince was an old SNL anniversary event i found online a few months ago back in like 1989
like one of his only appearences on SNL
Slowgo is required for this seed.
this seed is opening up quick
Prince was apparently quite finicky about his appearances.
Although he appeared on an episode of New Girl because he liked the show.
That is one cursed Boggie Man sleeping
The NG episode was so strange
Supposedly, they did a scene that was supposed to be at a party he was hosting. The show booked the Cardassians and he was like anybody but them.
oh  so you flat out cant get those partners as intended, you actually HAVE to get them as random drops
They had to unbook them and everything. Sounds awesome. After all, you know what the Cardassians do to their prisoners.
Oops, my mind went to Star Trek.
In a case like this, is it longer to dip 1 or 3?
honestly the only thing i really do know about prince is the whole feud with rick james
@colonelmendosa Funny, considering Chapelle parodied both of them.
when charlie murphy did that recap thing
The key alone is a payoff
But now basically anything can be anywhere
Pobably best case for that fight.
Spin Jump has very well-programmed hitboxes YEP
Which is the Paper Mario Rando discord?
i can just post the link
I usually only see on youtube
you monster, those kids are scared and in trouble
EVIL, DEMON, MONSTER, CAST THIS MAN INTO THE FIRE
well its a randomizer so he could actually just be bowser
oh hey I just noticed, lacky colors!
I hadnt seen that yet, neat!
nooo you fool you have to give that to koopa koot
also isnt that hidden block near monstar a check?
did I just black out how did I not see
cant you beat chapter 2 now though?
or did you clear that out
Seems climbing the mountain paid off
Hard required ultra boots seeds are rare
I thought bad Jank was called spunk? Kappa
sure thats what they all say
Kolorado was was Flavio before they could program a NPC to be with you Kappa
except kolorado is a thief >:O
I just don’t get why Kolorado gets so much hate over Flavio? LUL
okay but kolorado go on "archeology" trips to just steal shit from natives
I am a fan of both my boys Kolorado and Flavio phanto274Smile
at least flavio gets a moment or two
let us vote in a poll
chapter 1 or 2 vote now
Isn’t that vanilla dodge master placement in the shop too?
I'm in the ruins, please save me :(
so how we feeling about this seed?
oh did you make chili with the ghost pepper?
mk let me know how it is haha
with one of them hot peppers xD
yo iceblue just got the easy free 1.9 second time save
the parakarry jump in ruins first try LUL
good luck gamer, was able to finish seed 3
also fuck that, I never found last stand
I was still able to peril manip huff, crystal king, jr, and final bowser phanto274Mash
There aint no way im being dragged back into park NotLikeThis
ik haha im not doing any runs until i get this snorlax shit figured out
and it probably wont get figured out for my own sake
love the non vanilla ch6 trade quest
Goombaria? That kiss would make me shiver too phanto274Smile
nice water stone for crystal berry for dolly for Tubba Key for go mode
I like your Tubba castle routing you were doing earlier searching the items
going right first, breaking the floor then tracking back
alright, wot's the plan for Bowser?
damn, that's a nice bow color
why are you so good at menu'ing
That Smooch from Elderstar wad phanto274Shrug
Maybe even triple dip would have been useful Kappa
there's a 7 in the name, so I time him out for 7 seconds
