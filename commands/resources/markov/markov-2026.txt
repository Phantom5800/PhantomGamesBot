[2026-01-17 16:42:21 phantom5800: amishman19] @ That glitch looks horrendous to do but it's amazing what it lets you do the rest of the game
[2026-01-17 16:42:25 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ what trick is it?
[2026-01-17 16:42:39 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ ahh gotcha

[2026-01-17 16:47:44 phantom5800: amishman19] @ I think it will look kinda boring after the novelty wears off. Oh look at us, that wall can't stop me
[2026-01-17 16:47:44 phantom5800: mirby_studios] @ if a month is 4 weeks on average that's 80 weeks so yes lol

[2026-01-17 16:51:40 phantom5800: mirby_studios] @ well it can only get better in atlanta. hopefully. it's a low bar to clear at least

[2026-01-17 17:24:20 phantom5800: peachedpocky] @ but yes in regards to earlier I think it's because I've been jokingly referring to you as "uncle phantom" as in like, "my uncle works at Nintendo" bcuz you, well, used to work for Nintendo
[2026-01-17 17:25:15 phantom5800: peachedpocky] @ because there are 2 phantoms in my immediate circle so that's been my differential between the two lmao

[2026-01-17 17:26:59 phantom5800: buff00n] @ @AnniLyn2 that varies, in my experience

[2026-01-17 19:29:23 phantom5800: darkness3827] @ but since Phantom went around the cutscene trigger anyway that means his save & quit position is stuck there.
[2026-01-17 19:30:14 phantom5800: annilyn2] @ dude one time i got there and accidentally turned the fan on
[2026-01-17 19:31:33 phantom5800: angellove94] @ 1 day then I’ll be on a 25 day watch streak. I work tomorrow so I’ll have to catch the vod if you stream

[2026-01-18 15:22:29 phantom5800: mirby_studios] @ i just googled "monado boy" and someone named their FF14 character that. and it's not a throwaway they have a bunch of high level jobs and designed their character to look like shulk lmao
[2026-01-18 15:22:31 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ axl*
[2026-01-18 15:22:42 phantom5800: mirby_studios] @ incredible discovery
[2026-01-18 15:23:30 phantom5800: axl_sr] @ it was cool and fun but went on way longer than I wanted cause I had already spent all day at a con LUL
[2026-01-18 15:23:35 phantom5800: peelb4758] @ Monado boy might be the best nickname behind *fart*
[2026-01-18 15:24:00 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ @Axl_SR thats how it usually goes LUL glad you had fun. what kind of character did you roll?
[2026-01-18 15:24:14 phantom5800: amishman19] @ alright Phantom what happened to your hand and are you okay
[2026-01-18 15:24:20 phantom5800: amishman19] @ and was it prickly pear related
[2026-01-18 15:24:37 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ darkchip dust withdrawal
[2026-01-18 15:24:41 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ oof
[2026-01-18 15:24:42 phantom5800: amishman19] @ ugh that sucks
[2026-01-18 15:25:05 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ but uh, dont use darksword to cut your veggies
[2026-01-18 15:25:07 phantom5800: axl_sr] @ not the greatest of ideas, but I had no idea going in. I requested to be a giant making me a brutee with no spells.
[2026-01-18 15:25:29 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ that still sounds fun :)
[2026-01-18 15:26:24 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ during a oneshot i rolled a muscle wizard. it was really fun LUL
[2026-01-18 15:26:40 phantom5800: peelb4758] @ My first time playing dnd I nearly died in the first fight of the campaign
[2026-01-18 15:26:49 phantom5800: amishman19] @ hopefully not too deep phanto274Bless
[2026-01-18 15:28:19 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ So, I got a lot of project updates so we'll catch you up real quick
[2026-01-18 15:28:48 phantom5800: amishman19] @ @Axl_SR this just means you get to beat people up and not think how, excellent choice
[2026-01-18 15:29:10 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ TLDR; Installed Linux. Argued with it a lot. Got HDR and my stream deck working. Capture card doesn't have a Linux driver so guess need my laptop for that. Games perform well tho.
[2026-01-18 15:29:39 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ And I also solved the last of the bot architecture. Been meaning to work on it, keep getting side quested. Will work tonight and tomorrow since it's a holiday
[2026-01-18 15:29:44 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ AverMedia Live Gamer Extreme
[2026-01-18 15:29:55 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ Yeah basically any modern Elgato will work
[2026-01-18 15:29:59 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ Oop ad
[2026-01-18 15:30:00 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ HOLD
[2026-01-18 15:30:53 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ @Axl_SR in a long-running campaign my current character is a Fairy that used to be a court aerial acrobat, but got exiled to the material plane (the regular physical world) and is cursed to not have wings LUL theyre a warlock working for the archfey as an agent now
[2026-01-18 15:31:12 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ point being - no idea is too silly for dnd
[2026-01-18 15:31:29 phantom5800: revenant_the_mage] @ Just curious, but now that GDQ is over. Will you still do BN stuff?
[2026-01-18 15:31:32 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ honestly, minish cap is a fantastic setting for dnd LUL
[2026-01-18 15:31:37 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ Ok back
[2026-01-18 15:31:59 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ So yeah Elgatos will work, but I got the Avermedia since it has the component cable input for my Wii
[2026-01-18 15:32:00 phantom5800: revenant_the_mage] @ I really like the Minish Village theme
[2026-01-18 15:32:17 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ the music really good yeah
[2026-01-18 15:32:18 phantom5800: zeliversal] @ So if I got an Elgato I'd have to get an HDMI adapter for the Wii if I ever decided to use that and all that
[2026-01-18 15:32:20 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ village theme is so cute
[2026-01-18 15:32:38 phantom5800: sphyrwa] @ my overall favourite is cloud tops tho. i just love the orchestral heroic feel

[2026-01-18 17:33:39 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ this is fine

[2026-01-18 18:54:23 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ aw beans i missed it
[2026-01-18 18:54:38 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ I'm back
[2026-01-18 18:54:41 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ yeah true
[2026-01-18 18:54:50 phantom5800: basilouija] @ did you win
[2026-01-18 18:54:58 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ we ended early, so yes..?
[2026-01-18 18:55:12 phantom5800: basilouija] @ did you want it to end early
[2026-01-18 18:55:18 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ we mostly just talked through the setting and what all characters we wanted to run
[2026-01-18 18:55:29 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ we didn't get into the actual campaign yet technically
[2026-01-18 18:55:34 phantom5800: peachedpocky] @ I don't think you can tpk in a session 0
[2026-01-18 18:55:38 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ you can
[2026-01-18 18:55:42 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ you definitely can
[2026-01-18 18:55:45 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ talking like house rules and stuff; we're gonna try this weird "nimble" combat system
[2026-01-18 18:55:45 phantom5800: peachedpocky] @ how badly do you gotta fuck up
[2026-01-18 18:55:51 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ which ignores AC (basically)
[2026-01-18 18:56:08 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ so I have to change my build from tanky armor man to hitty sword man
[2026-01-18 18:56:09 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ if you're ignoring AC you may as well play a different TTRPG
[2026-01-18 18:56:49 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ you like.. still have it but you have to use a reaction to block for it to matter; *apparently* the goal of the nimble system is to reduce the amount of "nobody hits" rounds
[2026-01-18 18:56:56 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ and make minions die real fast or something
[2026-01-18 18:57:09 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ idk we're gonna try it a few sessions and see if we like it phanto274Shrug
[2026-01-18 18:57:13 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ you have to use a reaction? i already hate it
[2026-01-18 18:57:36 phantom5800: peachedpocky] @ is that your way of saying you're glad basil isn't chatting anymore
[2026-01-18 18:57:42 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ @BasilOuija I was fine with it ending early, we were mostly just chatting by the end and only like 2 of us had already landed on a specific character build
[2026-01-18 18:57:55 phantom5800: basilouija] @ @PeachedPocky what the fuck
[2026-01-18 18:58:00 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ omg hi basil
[2026-01-18 18:58:02 phantom5800: peachedpocky] @ @BasilOuija peache114Heart
[2026-01-18 18:58:11 phantom5800: risch] @ GL xkilioBless
[2026-01-18 18:58:20 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ @Punkin_Spice_Latte then you'll love this, you get 3 "action points" per round which go towards anything you can do, and if you spend them all on your turn, no reactions lol
[2026-01-18 18:58:27 phantom5800: peachedpocky] @ in my defence basil was the last non purple name to speak
[2026-01-18 18:58:27 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ action pointa
[2026-01-18 18:58:29 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ points*
[2026-01-18 18:58:33 phantom5800: risch] @ LUL
[2026-01-18 18:58:33 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ JUST PLAY PATHFINDER???
[2026-01-18 18:58:41 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ look I'm not DM punkin
[2026-01-18 18:58:43 phantom5800: risch] @ I'd likely be down
[2026-01-18 18:59:01 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ I did have that thought though
[2026-01-18 18:59:05 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ pathfinder literally uses AP
[2026-01-18 18:59:10 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ i am going to kill your DM
[2026-01-18 18:59:18 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ aww he's nice though
[2026-01-18 18:59:22 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ this is 2 DMs now i want to violence, for explicitly different reasons
[2026-01-18 18:59:26 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ he just gets overly excited by new ideas
[2026-01-18 18:59:40 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ he should try new ideas, like things that aren't DnD
[2026-01-18 18:59:44 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ lmao
[2026-01-18 18:59:58 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ i DO say how i really feel and it gets me in trouble
[2026-01-18 19:00:09 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ it's also funny because the entire setting is fully homebrew so it really could be a different system
[2026-01-18 19:00:16 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ i mean setting is w/e
[2026-01-18 19:00:21 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ i homebrew all my DnD settings
[2026-01-18 19:00:29 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ the forgotten realms suck ass
[2026-01-18 19:00:35 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ I think he just hasn't tried another system yet so D&D is a comfort thing even if it's not really D&D anymore
[2026-01-18 19:00:38 phantom5800: punkin_spice_latte] @ if i wanted racism i'd just go to the living room
[2026-01-18 19:00:49 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ NOTED
[2026-01-18 19:01:35 phantom5800: kimchikiss] @ Exandria all the way
[2026-01-18 19:01:35 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ oh sorry
[2026-01-18 19:01:50 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ berter hi
[2026-01-18 19:02:26 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ nimbus hi
[2026-01-18 19:03:28 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ we'll see how this campaign goes though, a couple of the guys are from the group I was asked to leave by the DM (different DM) because I "wasn't taking the campaign seriously enough"
[2026-01-18 19:03:52 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ so who knows lmao may or may not end up going through this whole campaign anyways
[2026-01-18 19:04:07 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ berter you seem like you get not very good DMs
[2026-01-18 19:04:16 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ that one I do not talk to anymore
[2026-01-18 19:04:29 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ this one is very excitable but he's always been a nice guy
[2026-01-18 19:05:47 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ what about the dragons, do you remember those?
[2026-01-18 19:06:00 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ sadge

[2026-01-18 19:09:14 phantom5800: basilouija] @ the one it was just on idk I wasn't paying attention
[2026-01-18 19:09:35 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ oh i didn't know that, weird NOTED

[2026-01-18 19:20:29 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ Honestly, Berter, yeah, this is a real good one
[2026-01-18 19:20:54 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ @Nimbus125 it is better than TP
[2026-01-18 19:21:02 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ sounds good, I have no real idea of what order to play them in, but I feel like I may as well try to get through most of the main ones
[2026-01-18 19:21:13 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ maybe that'll be my hashtag gaming goal for the year
[2026-01-18 19:21:21 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ Minish cap is good and fair
[2026-01-18 19:21:21 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ Sadge you are now better at tmc than me so your word is law

[2026-01-18 19:27:39 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ I know Elden Ring and Hollow Knight will both take a while, esp since I'm a slower player and a completionist
[2026-01-18 19:27:40 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ thanks goof

[2026-01-18 19:49:37 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ @TheGlubbers It's a fanfic because, in canon, Tifa tops limesNodders

[2026-01-18 19:50:01 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ that would be an awesome class
[2026-01-18 19:50:01 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ there's no way tifa isn't a top
[2026-01-18 19:50:02 phantom5800: yadungoofed] @ what if we all started talking about linguistic corpora
[2026-01-18 19:50:26 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ I know next to nothing but yeah no way she isn't a top
[2026-01-18 19:50:26 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ if tifa bottoms then i'm suddenly her biggest fan
[2026-01-18 19:50:31 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ lmao
[2026-01-18 19:50:51 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ Suddenly? limesBlink
[2026-01-18 19:51:02 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ I feel like I'm more of an Aerith fan after the remake games
[2026-01-18 19:51:08 phantom5800: buff00n] @ aerith tops, tifa's touch starved and cloud's the bottom
[2026-01-18 19:51:18 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ i haven't played the games cuz i plan to play the remake
[2026-01-18 19:51:20 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ remember
[2026-01-18 19:51:25 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ ah right
[2026-01-18 19:51:39 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ but aerith gives bottom vibes
[2026-01-18 19:51:51 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ well I like Aerith's design and the personality they give her in the remakes
[2026-01-18 19:51:58 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ lovable goofball energy
[2026-01-18 19:52:13 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ In the original, yes. In the remake, Aerith switches it up.
[2026-01-18 19:52:17 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ Aerith... is a soft switch with a preference for the top
[2026-01-18 19:52:36 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ Honestly, I think she's a top that wishes she were a bottom
[2026-01-18 19:52:55 phantom5800: yadungoofed] @ I fear I may have lost the plot of this convo NOTED
[2026-01-18 19:52:58 phantom5800: basilouija] @ why are we talking about the sexual power dynamics of FF7 characters
[2026-01-18 19:53:07 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ Shits and giggles, mostly
[2026-01-18 19:53:07 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ basil i think that's obvious
[2026-01-18 19:53:07 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ idk why not
[2026-01-18 19:53:09 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ why aren't we
[2026-01-18 19:53:11 phantom5800: buff00n] @ that lady in the kimono tho
[2026-01-18 19:53:12 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ it's a twitch chat
[2026-01-18 19:53:22 phantom5800: buff00n] @ she 1000% is a dom
[2026-01-18 19:53:22 phantom5800: basilouija] @ well Midna is obviously a top
[2026-01-18 19:53:25 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ Basil, who tops and bottoms between Midna and Zelda?
[2026-01-18 19:53:33 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ okay so the sexual power dynamics of ff7 characters when represented as TP characters
[2026-01-18 19:53:34 phantom5800: basilouija] @ I think I just answered your question Knux
[2026-01-18 19:53:39 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ I love that they already answered you knux
[2026-01-18 19:53:43 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ before you got the chance to ask
[2026-01-18 19:53:48 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ ganondorf is obviously signified by aerith...
[2026-01-18 19:53:50 phantom5800: buff00n] @ midna rides you a majority of the game
[2026-01-18 19:53:54 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ both are power bottoms
[2026-01-18 19:54:07 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ I could see ganondorf and aerith being analogs
[2026-01-18 19:54:14 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ for very funny reasons
[2026-01-18 19:54:15 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ @Bug_Berter Look, we all knew the joke that was going to be made, this entire occurrence was destined to happen.
[2026-01-18 19:54:22 phantom5800: buff00n] @ tf is an analog
[2026-01-18 19:54:28 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ one maps to the other
[2026-01-18 19:54:41 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ @buff00n something on modern controllers
[2026-01-18 19:54:45 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ @buff00n It's when a dead tree gets shoved up someone's ass
[2026-01-18 19:54:47 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ @buff00n something that sends a continuous electric signal
[2026-01-18 19:54:48 phantom5800: basilouija] @ @TheGlubbers is it because they both get stabbed through the chest
[2026-01-18 19:54:57 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ basil spoilers

[2026-01-18 20:00:04 phantom5800: yadungoofed] @ @Nimbus125 I forgot for a moment, but yes I do know that
[2026-01-18 20:00:12 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ yadungPensive he doesn't know
[2026-01-18 20:00:14 phantom5800: yadungoofed] @ I didnt know phoenix down was in reference to the feather type
[2026-01-18 20:00:28 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ yeah
[2026-01-18 20:00:29 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ yeah
[2026-01-18 20:00:32 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ so goof you know how phoenixes are birds (which have feathers) that also revive themselves from the dead
[2026-01-18 20:00:36 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ there are also phoenix pinions in some games
[2026-01-18 20:00:38 phantom5800: yadungoofed] @ yeah
[2026-01-18 20:01:04 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ any% is also baby mode because from this point to the end you have access to a fairy every like 5 minutes
[2026-01-18 20:01:08 phantom5800: yadungoofed] @ I dont know why its this shocking that I didnt know phoenix down was in reference to the feather type, Im stupid nimbus avarie1Laugh
[2026-01-18 20:01:09 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ with pinion being "any of the larger wing or tail feathers of a bird"
[2026-01-18 20:01:14 phantom5800: brandino59] @ oh this is glitchless
[2026-01-18 20:01:31 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ The real question is, the fuck's a Mega Phoenix?
[2026-01-18 20:01:38 phantom5800: brandino59] @ my girlfriend got me to watch the first episode of gossip girl
[2026-01-18 20:01:40 phantom5800: brandino59] @ it’s certainly a show
[2026-01-18 20:01:42 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ phoenix that mega evolved
[2026-01-18 20:01:49 phantom5800: theglubbers] @ that darknut fight strat is hilarious
[2026-01-18 20:01:51 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ @Bug_Berter limesNoted
[2026-01-18 20:02:04 phantom5800: sanaerys_] @ Probably one of those new fangled pokemans
[2026-01-18 20:02:14 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ @KnuxTenma Down is a baby feather (the soft stuff that grows in before the true feathers develop), so probably comes from a more mature (more powerful) phoenix
[2026-01-18 20:02:40 phantom5800: nimbus125] @ they can
[2026-01-18 20:05:27 phantom5800: sanaerys_] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Wait but shouldn't the stronger feathers come from the older bird? Wouldn't down have just come from a barely-not-baby bird?
[2026-01-18 20:06:03 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ oh also turns out I didn't have (or can't find if I did have) a wiimote avarie1Aware
[2026-01-18 20:06:27 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ so it'll be another week or two before I can start pokepark :pensivewobble:
[2026-01-18 20:06:43 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ @Sanaerys_ Isn't Mega Phoenix a full party revive/heal vs Phoenix Down just being a single revive, similar to revive/Max revive in Pokemon? It's been a while
[2026-01-18 20:07:20 phantom5800: sanaerys_] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Idk, in fact I don't even know what game we're talking about. All I know is birds
[2026-01-18 20:08:04 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ "Mega Phoenix revives all KO'd party members, fully restoring their HP"
[2026-01-18 20:08:21 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ and apparently "Using a Phoenix Pinion in battle summons Phoenix, a pseudo-GF that deals Fire damage and raises any fallen party members"
[2026-01-18 20:08:37 phantom5800: mauri] @ Sup @phantom5800
[2026-01-18 20:08:43 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ @Bug_Berter That depends on the game, in some games, it's a step between Phoenix Down and Mega Phoenix
[2026-01-18 20:08:46 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ so they're similar just from different games; pinion in FF8 and 9 and mega phoenix in 10
[2026-01-18 20:08:49 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ a pseudo girlfriend.... wish I had one of those
[2026-01-18 20:08:51 phantom5800: mauri] @ what's uuup? ^^ UwU ^_^
[2026-01-18 20:09:43 phantom5800: fatpidgeybirb] @ I will make the girlfriend joke any time I am capable of doing such. Guardian Forces? Great Fairy? NO. Girlfriend.
[2026-01-18 20:10:09 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ @KnuxTenma what would the step between be, like revive plus full heal but still single target?
[2026-01-18 20:10:12 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Both of these things are also girlfriends limesNodders

[2026-01-18 20:11:51 phantom5800: sanaerys_] @ @FatPidgeyBirb Because that is a literal child NODDERS
[2026-01-18 20:12:02 phantom5800: knuxtenma] @ @Bug_Berter In 8, it's a full-party revive that's weaker than a Mega Phoenix. In 9, it's a single target revive that heals more than a Down. limesShrug
[2026-01-18 20:12:03 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ nah I get it and agree phantom
[2026-01-18 20:12:24 phantom5800: bug_berter] @ nah I just looked it up

The best thing you can do it get a sampler platter tour so you get a little taste of what every place has to offer and then your next trips can be more focused. Usual travel tips apply; eat the food, see the things, listen to the locals.
