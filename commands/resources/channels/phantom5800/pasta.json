    "quote": "I need to confess. I have cheated all my runs on the leaderboard. Some parts were spliced, others TASed. Worse, I modded the game beyond recognition. I removed multibounce so I could get first try speedy. I increased the LZS window to 69 years because I couldn't get it right. I put cocaine on the street lamp to attract the green toad. I removed chapter 6. Most egregiously, I even made Bowser behave. I'm such a fake that I even faked submitting the runs. I'm sorry for the damage I've done.",

You may be the first person to ever record it though, which is proof and gives you the title which is awesome. But when you think you're the best at a game, there's always someone better. And they usually come from Japan.",

Once it has been reduced to several sharp chunks, I will unleash it into my unsuspecting stomach. After that, it's up to my doctor. That is how confident I am that this run is dead.",

    "quote": "Playing the game at a different speed has an effect on how you're playing - for example, playing a game in slow-motion and adjusting the time for it would be considered cheating. The fact that the Nintendo Switch doesn't play games at the same speed also means it's not emulating the Game Boy Advance in an accurate enough manner, which is another strike against speedrunning guidelines.",
