good luck
I'm excited to try this
yoo glgl
nice peril manip
restart computer!
i now have the english MM practice rom on my wii
english is faster for any% nmg/unrestricted for various reasons lmao
I felt that
yeah iirc english is faster for srm categories but the only one i'd run is any% unrestricted cuz it's 20 minutes long lol
definitely more interesting in nmg tho
WHOS THIS SEWER FREAK
that was the best thing i've ever fucking seen
what was that sewer man what was that
yo phantom GL HF
also thanks again for inviting me to do commentary, I had a blast
I was glad to have risch there, I couldn't have explained many things in that much detail LUL
hmm i will consider clicking the follow button
wouldn't it be funny if you got struck by lightning a third time
its comedy rules of threes, itll happen
Hai hai, you wonderful person, you. :D
I'm alright. Did I come in at a weird time? LuL
Not.. AT ALL? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Side note: I made tacos. :D
Naturally, I made enough for everyone.
Go pick that badge up, mister. >:I
Badges have feelings too.
That badge is going to be dwelling on that all day long ... like ... Damn ... I can't believe that Luigi(?) didn't want me ... That's harsh ...
oh no ... gosts
guess who got a raphnet today?!
and they work together!
setup was a pain
kept mapping start to hammer
don't laugh!
That flower just destroyed you, and then gave you pity money that it stole from your pocket while you were distracted.
I just woke up tho and have to get ready for work. I'll explain more stuff later over discord
have fun gamer
Ah yes. The shyghosts.
I like that you had to go the mansion to get that.
When the game is kind-of? vanilla.
Nice Sushi colors.
Haven't seen that one before.
why do you look flat
pokeball sushie
I'm kidding. Don't hate me. ;-;
In before they're all chilling in a single corner of the flower field?
Did you already hug Act 1?
Right. Forgot if you can set the bridge to be down by default or not.
This is a pretty rude chapter six placement.
she water on my block til i squirt
What the **** did I just read?
The game is making you do some things that you don't want to do. LuL
Have you fought the early dojo fights?
Oh. Got'cha.
You can do it!
The real question is if you should do it.
Nice refund.
Such a weirdly strong badge.
I had no idea how good Refund was, when I was young.
Well done!
The things we do when the seed is being rude.
If you have a quote bot, I'd like to petition for adding "You better have a mailman in your pocket."
Also, that penguin had a cloud in his cupboard.
I mean, where else do you keep your cloud turtle things?
Certainly not in the sky like a savage.
It really, really wants you to go to Bowser's Castle. KEKwait
Depends on the chapter attached, I guess?
Did we thought? Did we really?
That's rough, buddy.
Thanks, windows.
Windows: Notice me, senpai. *Hides knife behind back*
My audio drivers do the big dumb every time my windows updates.
don't tell my sister
Clearly, you need star pieces.
He was thinking about it. I mean, everyone in this seed is, from what we've seen.
Luigi(?) has just pissed a lot of people off.
That's all.
you know what would make traps better
You ever just find a calculator out in the desert?
if it showed the same pickup animation for the item
annd then exploded
mario holds it above his head and gets struck by lightning
run ded
I went to get a drink of water, and I missed what?
Strugglebus, here we come!
As much as I love hanging out here, I might go play some DBD soon.
I'm ... assuming? that you don't play DBD?
I have severe anxiety to the point of having a heart that tries to physically end me. I don't bleeping know why I play DBD.
I wonder how many items you use on average in all of your Paper Mario seeds.
It really varies, though. 'Cause like ... sometimes it's a couple items due to good luck, and, sometimes it's ... a LOT of items.
how much is power bounce?
Attack FX Attic
I'd like to request turning on Attack FX A, in honor of this being quite A seed.
Oh neat.
The shyguys are on something today.
He was too powerful. They had to keep Kooper and his shell separate.
We can do chapter 1 now, right?
Oh gods. Imagine if the slot machine was in the pool.
I really want the piggos to be in the pool. >:I
Always Bow.
But, slapping the **** out of stuff.
lurking while driving
dont watch stream and drive
Why did Kooper have that?
Kooper is just an all or nothing kinda guy, you know?
He's dead, Jim.
How much is the hp plus? LuL
fire flower must pay for what it did
Hello my darling
Hello my ragtime gal
runs into the bomb jail break out expecting to come out of it alive
so ... what did all of these traps replace in the item pool?
Such as?
random lightning strikes
These Koopa bros colors. LuL
They're like an even more scuffed version of themselves.
And that's saying something.
Time for a gamba? LuL
That's a welcome party.
Are you slowly or rapidly losing your sanity? Since it's not a question of if.
For sure. Instead of just ... "We know that we have to full clear. Let's go, auto pilot!"
Bowser's elite patrol right there.
good ol' Windows bullying
was good! Finished Coromon and jumped into Boyfriend Dungeon unironically Kappa
how's the rando?
What's Assumed Fill? :o
so a more diverse logic to items?
sweet. Love me some extra rando BloodTrail
ez game Kappa
Five and a half hour seed?
that just means fun then :)
what's Assumed Fill?
I watch PM Rando, I don't keep up with the development
What is assumed fill? Well ... when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much..
The easy answer for all Rando ... ... Just Hundo the Seed 4Head Kappa
I'd like the randomizer to be able to randomize the desert "area" tiles.
I've played enough other Randos where it's happened LUL
Chomp. :O
Oh neat.
The logic for this seed has been all over the place.
This is gonna be a long one. LuL
She's just exploding with love.
f I'm late, gl hf!
assumed already giving you a wild goose chase i see
oh god is that a 'total time playing rando' timer?
im so sorry lmao
what a bro
what trap setting are you rocking
i think it's 25% of consumables then? ... something like that
booming voice there chanterelle
duude what a chain
yea okay pape, lol
was that in the cloud a maple?
dude the god combo of jump badges, what
lol, welp
you know, that tracker has a great notepad function i heard
tbf I'm also really bad at taking notes
Oh I'll probably remember that, how could I not? ... 10 minutes later ...
Ah. I succumbed to my taco food coma. How goes the seed?
Still no birb.
did AntiGuy ever have something for you?
aight gotta bounce, wish you that portrait soon lol
Give water stone to Lily in chapter 6?
Did you buy from Rip Cheeto?
Is it one of the vines?
Didn't they just add that you can give the artifact to Kolorado without finishing Ch2?
Assumed fill too hard so you had to cheat with glitches Kappa
Yep, that's what happens when things are actually random
no more easy runs
well, maybe some, but not most
ooh, that's a sick color for Peach
lurking cuz driving
nice gold Kappa
is this WABITR?
you love to see it
good luck with your first run that totally won't be able to watch
brace yourself, I've acquired Malort's
gl gamer
ngl I was surprised to find out that there are 10 falzar runs
"I don't know what Malort's is" you will come CB
you WILL
bop the boss Pog
not yet
you can put it in if you want
it's good vs diveman and aquaman
yeah it's better if it's A code
yeah trnarrw code doesn't matter in gregar
Wait, you're playing Falzar?
you can use it on elementman
in pav3
Welp time to wait for yet another cable
There's no display port so time to spend 50 bucks on a usb converter
I just want my fucking monitor so I can do anything I want to
what do you mean there is no display port and no functional hdmi
That literally wont work
the pc doesn't have it
there is 2 hdmi and a dvi
God I'm dumb they were fuckin plugged
Thank you for curing stupidity for me
yoo good luck my dude!
I believe in you
most importantly
weed mario believes in u
just imagine him with a thumbs up instead of a hand on his hip
my clip finger was ready
I love falzar for that reason. can't brute force it
thus far, Falzar seems like pain
I love it
spoutman is amazing. drip drip
do you have splits inside your splits?? sick
Why would you want it earlier when you could have it now
wait what the fuck are you
olimar lookin ass
Lance pog
it's Aquaman, or SpoutMan, cuz Capcom USA didn't want to get sued
good call
man, I love watching MegaMan just SWOOCE all over the place
you got robbed with that ElementTrap
GG yess. good job
yaa it is hard to tell at first
on a phone call, lurking
PBs were built on hope
or whatever the saying is. glgl
good evening phantom, GL HF
huh ... on my screen your name is exacltly 0.5 pixels wider than mine.
never noticed it was that close
I tried to click on you and twitch took me to the browse category list
Twitch dont want me here
ok so the one use of this tech for wario so far
huh ... now that you mention it ... yeah it is
Is nair combos like 5% longer
But we could already do that lol
Back in my day, we had to click on streams uphill both ways
The input is free at least
It's just fuck up a halfcircle by one number lol
I randomly woke up at 3am, so here I am LUL
I went to bed at 22:30 like a responsible adult *shudder*
did you find out the milk was bad before you had some?
late night gang
oh good
I've found out the milk went bad the wrong way before
would not recommend
I think I could use this for zard but that's like it lol
cause the full momentum nair input only works on nair so I could use this for back air or something
reset then
I missed half of it
wait you can just gold the button for text boxes? Must be nice Kappa
as it should be, really
Rune factory does that :)
although the way BN does it also makes a lot of sense
5 I might actually figure out a route for, the storyline seems MUCH better to run and I actually have movement tech to work with from shortswords
Shortsword charge attacks break movement it's so fun
If you do it off a hill you keep full momentum of your dash and the gravity is so low that you just go so fucking far
Hai hai.
Hai grumpypants?
You seem like you're having a time.
Oh okay. Haha.
gold though
Pape 64 (REAL)
All around me are familiar faaaces, worn out plaaaceeessss
pay the penalty
oh were we predicting? LUL
uh, sorry my phone bugged out I definitely meant 3,3,3
blame it on autocorrect
Tell us of this plan of yours.
Oh good.
What could possibly go wrong? Four hours of work, all with the possibility of catastrophic failure that could have been avoided?
that sounds horrible
speedrunners man
built differently
The self abuse.
It's fine. You've got this. First try, new PB.
I don't know if I'd still run BN if Gregar was a 50-50 LUL
But it feels longer. LuL
hmm yeah, that's a big difference
it's okay, there's plenty of time to bounce back
so at worst it's a coin flip for a PB
Congrats on the WR.
wait what
Do you think that a skip directly into the final chapter is theoretically possible? Via, I dunno, glitching into loads zones and such?
damn, that coin flip saves a lot of time Kappa
Like ... hidden under levels and such.
Just some void?
It has to be somewhere.
I love speedy spin
rip run Sadge
Ok after fiddling with the "tech" for a bit I never drop it because it's just a timed half circle and I'm only gonna use it on zard lol
Puts his tail behind him in like 2 frames so kinda want that
So, if chapter five has said trigger glitch, then ... surely the other chapters have un-discovered loadzones too?
I get that, but like, even the card has to be stored somewhere. The loadzone attached to the card is stored somewhere.
Sorry if I'm being annoying about it, but, I refuse to believe that it's impossible.
Not with that attitude.
I can now down throw up smash with zard but like
why the fuck would I ever do that
bthrow bair is same damage better position and bthrow nair sets up for 0 to death lol
I dunno. It took them like ... 20 years to skip the WW barrier.
ACE is busted
That's pretty fun.
Is there any tech in this game that is similar to a lot of the Zelda game's extended bomb boost jumps?
Also hate gimrs video because he puts a part that says "Shotos can do this" and you know what char type he doesnt show
Terry has no shoryu fireball or tatsu
Well I guess rising tackle is kind of a shoryu now in 15 but not in smash
I drank all of my orange juice, and now I'm sad. ;-; It's all gone.
Correction: I chugged all of my orange juice because it was too tasty, and I couldn't help myself.
What did Chomp ever do to you? D:
You monster.
One time is one too many. >.>
Nicely done!
Hey gl on the runs!
such a long category props to you
OH SWEET! that means alot :)
definitely LUL People usually run the pc or N64 emu version
Maybe this could help with THIS waft confirm
Thought to myself then I do it and it works if I do it perfect
But then I did it just with a dash and it worked better LOL
ok the one thing it would do is make jablock waft easier
because I dont have to do my jump input frame perfect
Void is tweeting clips of it and it's just him shitting on people who aren't anti-airing him and doing a b reverse
If I do this jaemi is going to dragdown forward air me and I am dead
fuck falco
The only useful things I've seen so far are helping bad turnaround animations and diddy kong can dtilt z drop banana if he picks it up with dtilt
But like any safe air you'd hit a shield with point blank you have a positive on the rps anyway so unless your dashback NEEDS it then why do it lol
warios dashback for example is mad fucking good because he lifts his ass up and leans immediately and his feet dont exist lol
GOLD gold
ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOUR SOUL
I'd love if you had this
cuz if you could select from 3 random items, I think that'd be hilarious
which of these items does Mario hate, Princess?:
true, that in itself is fun
Kammy places Goombario in front of chest
gl gl phanto274Bless
It's summer heat already where I live
Nicely done.
Did you draw your splits background?
Oh I see it nice
They're adding what for artists?
Oh that's pretty cool
I was born in 95 monkaS
yooo phantom gl on the run!! phanto274Bless
did you end up getting milk??
Also i hate chapter 5 Madge
not that guy. he killed my run earlier
I need to work on this chapters movement specifically.
All aboard the strugglebus!
ty for stream phantom!! Hope to catch the next one soon! peepoWave
I had a fright jar fail, jumped on fire bar, got speedied and a pokey encountered me when I was trying to bombette first strike :)
Ah. I live
I'm ... on hope
Right. Forgot if you were fuckin plugged
As much is amazing. drip
huh ... on my darling
dont want the follow button
I went to click on a drink of yours.
She's just imagine him with that
This is amazing. drip drip drip drip
One time my wii
Hey I'm driving home, so can't talk. good luck
Hopped on quickplay cause I just wanted to play and this mario was just mashing the rar shit so I went zard
He didn't live very long
he put himself at backair tipper range every time LOL
I also refuse to call this the gimr or any of the names he gave it because it's just a control stick angle lol
Yea you just corner notch after an initial dash
If you flick it you go back and if you dont you just drift in it's not really anything new lolll
Anything I've tested with this I do with just an attack cancel or full momentum nair or even just a dash and it's the same thing LOL
The only thing I'd use this for is for like fullhop back airs because you can't attack cancel that
Yea that's what I do for my bike look wavebounces
I went to the alt account to check follow requests and an anime tab pops up and it's just some cosplay girls ass
This is why I never have home page on
I literally only follow RF artists on that account and it's like 10 of them lol
I just followed like 10 artists I like most on that account so my timeline is only that and nothing else
Since that account is just for annoyed rambling I may as well have something I want to see while I'm there lol
doing a normal run i see
We should rando race sometime now that my pc wouldn't explode for it
yeah gl
what is top 15 rn?
really? damn. slopdop was top 10 when I started my grind
thank you for harnessing bad rng, it may help with the decision to run tonight
I have never recovered from absorbing morphs rng to get any% record
yeah, I would've gotten 3:46 probably
my rng is still godawful after that
i bought so much shit today!!!
mini min amiibo
monkey ball banana mania
network transmission
and a logitech litra
most recent, i got it on PS5 for 20 bucks
you will one day KEKW
I can join the next NT race LUL
EzekielSD : Alright so ... arbitrary code execution, you can jump into the blue house? And y'all got Clippy? EzekielHD : Yeah. EzekielSD : The future is crunk! EzekielHD : Anything else you wanna know? EzekielSD : Is Final Bowser too much? Am I ready? EzekielHD : I can't tell you everything. But if you want to make history, you got to charge your own jumps. EzekielSD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD + EzekielHD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD : We going to the volcano!
yeah, last one had a turn out for 7 runners
its only hard in the beginning
Ah Phantom5800, I see that you've included the partner Goombario in your party. However, I see that he's also surrounded by other trash partners. Instead why not use Goombario, the best partner in Paper Mario? It opens you up to some real all-star attacks, like Tattle and Multibonk.
Dear Twitch User Phantom5800: I noticed your chat does not contain the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. I have decided it is best to add this pasta to your chat forthwith rather than unfollow. Again, the pasta I am adding to your chat is the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. Thank You.
phantom, its happening phanto274Hype
Bored Ape #1398 Owner says buying NTFs was Biggest Regret of his life. He is unable to sell it for even a fraction of what he spent, it financially ruined him.
The collapse begins guys ...

also gl, sorry i had to get some pastas out
you gonna continue bird up or just a one and done?
thought about doing an unboxing for the litra
imagine doing unboxing for lighting without any lighting KEKW

Hai hai. :D
Bad. >:(
Grumpy bad, though.
So, it's manageable.
I see that you are pulling out all of the tricks for this.
20 bp
not possible
I'm aware.
I'm memeing.
i think 8 is most unless I'm forgetting a thing

this sounds like every rando race i've asked about lmao
holy shit that charge

i was ready for the big dumb attack but forgot the little clouds take his turn if you die
did u save yoshi's?
but what if the yoshis have weed for mario
buy goombario
mario needs that
what if partner attacks are randomized? like bomb is headbonk and headbonk is waterblock and waterblock is bom
komari is disappointed in you
"I dont really care about bird" KEKW
i mean someone had to say it
im going to head out and watch rest on vod

I've beat his ass in 3 parking lots now
i'm calling the police rn

on phantom for killing children
you threw it at jr
it's not about using it
that's funny af
it was on jr that is the problem
just time out
up and away him
just fright jar him
probably dink anyways
there should be a setting that puts good badges in out of the way places
mod bp plus so it can randomly take more than it gives
The Skollar Smooch is Hilarious
I think a nut animation specifically on bowser would be better
bowser can u not
4/20 lmao
wait sorry this is serious
shield 4 turns in a row bowser

if you tried to brute force your way with everything else you would have died
just 3 stocked Elite Smash Aegis. Thrice in a row.
the 1st three stock, I'm morally obligated to give a runback
the 2nd, I felt bad
the 3rd, I moved on
I mean, I'd want a runback if I got 3-stocked
be the change you wanna see in the world
start with the man in the mirror
we talking about YGO?
yeah there needs to be best of 3 to understand some counterplay
one game benefits shitters, who'll gladly dip after one game
I still think it's hilarious that there's like very few cards in Yu-Gi-Oh that say, "what's that, I beat you in a single game and you're expecting more? NOPE!!! I JUST WIN THE ENTIRE MATCH THERE AND THEN!" and then victory dragon proceeded to be banned.
I don't fathom how people willingly dip from a close game, and a stable connection
"Damn, they got me. I'll get them on the runback- !? THIS MF'ER LEFT!"
it's last stock, both of us kill% and dude LEAVES cuz they got their W on a rando???
fuck outta here
I wanna play
It's the Super Prologue Bros.
damn prologue just started
there are worst prologues, admittedly
imagine having to sit through KH2's prologue every time you wanted to do a run
KH2 I can skip cutscenes
@Ohrocks but you can't skip the tutorials
they gotta make sure you're alive still after skipping the cutscenes
uh... art is cool
we missed prologue Sadge
i got 3:07:58 with race rules
kinda surprised
i don't think we'll be seeing any more sub 3s with assumed fill
oh ya i meant with race rules
I almost forgot the good luck weed
with glitches and coincidences some pretty wild stuff could happen
now you wont get speedied
Look earlier I told monado that the freeform jazz would make early bobbery work and then it did so
@TacoGuyy "good luck weed" should I pop an edible, for luck?
Do it
Alright I'm gonna go do a windwaker run to yolo a pb before I say fuck this game again
Dog island as a grind game sounds painful with the rng
edible has been popped
you have to PB now
it's the rule
Alright gl on the rest time to remind myself why I'm dropping a game quick
believe in the weed
@TacoGuyy later mate
also yes
someone @ me in 10 minutes for another gl w speedy
turtle soup
damn you, badge man
hello there phantom :F
saw your last run rip bowser fight
ill get behind cursed cart
I'm saving up so i can make you a rando seed :D
i'm on a good way 4.3k
do you want to know the number tho?
it's not been that bad phantom
i dont know if I've ever seen you actually get 1st try speedy
i did not know the record any% of this game is 1h 41m 02s
yeah its morph
wiiu is a 1:41:07
cool rigby is on the list
he is on 82
it looks like a fun route
huh i wonder what happened that cost you 35 seconds in this run
i guess we'll never know
well good luck i'm heading out it's 4 in the morning for me so time for bed :D
quite a controller scheme
oh that is dope
thanks phantom have fun with the run
i used to do that playing casually on wii
i was a spin masher even when i was bad
gosh i sure have
really arent selling running this in anything other than rando
you know what's funny though
it's only the good runs lmao
everything usually is fine if I'm playing like shit
i haven't had everything line up for a while
oh dear
do you have the fight memorized?
welcome to my 3:43:55
it was my biggest mistake in that run
other than getting double dink
honestly, thinking of it that way, 51 second diff
20 of it was boo portrait 20 was double dink
my current pb is barely better than my old one
im a nobody now
i lost jcog vip F
run is looking pretty good so far
how the fuck did i mess up that bad
go fast
going fast PridePog
nm, how are you?
good ol' gambling speedrun Kappa
but Mario always wins. That has to count for something
wow no tailers
shockingly it landed heads
ez moneys
though I did bet so I can't end the prediction
welp time to wait a day
there is more than one of us
gl gl
gl gl
had a good any% run
awesome speedrun
yo raids
hi taco
That game is dead to me
whats good taco
Procced phantom ganon in ff2 so couldn't door clip and just decided I don't really care that much to keep going
No I didn't even get there lol
Triggered the miniboss so I couldn't go up there without being stopped
And can't kill him because no master sword
You get master sword from ganondorf cutscene
He gives you the weapon to kill him :)
I should make a layout for pape rando and fuck around with that tbh
For when I'm learning ori to still do something
Rando has been fun and I can LZS so it wouldn't be glitchless
that bee makes weed mario sad
I made a weedmario command in my chat and named it mxfour since they made my name theirs
what won
heads or ass
this is hands down my favorite ascii art
I sent you what it actually looks like
yo glgl
hi lips
you were akari
you should mash a+b as the battle fades out after your hurricane, it ends the battle faster
it applies to any fight where you gain 0 xp
weird game
weren't we wondering if it just applied to every fight period for a while
yeah we were but I feel like it's only true for 0 XP fights
could be wrong tho
EZ Clap
I do better when I'm looking at my controller vs looking at screen
for do a regular speedrun can I redeem hammer% KEKW
i wanna see you suffer though
Actually I don't want that lemme refund myself LOL
he IS doing a regular speedrun smh
that one marathon you did months ago did
I dont wanna see anyone do 3D world any% doesnt look interresting
And you told them No :)
3d world any% is only cool to me with the movement jank but like nobody does it because it's brutally hard to keep consistent with getting stars
Just get a perfect bowser
Do what jcog did that other night ezpz
well then do the equivalent
taco, check #general
mario to min min LUL
once we get sora I can finally stop monkaS
I think it's best to not get the sora one
don' acknowledge his existence
I was so relived once I got bayo "its finally over" Then Ulitimate got teased. "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!"
just nut on bowser again
I don't like the frame of him looking left
I dont wanna post that one anymore
mario threw a tantrum
he wanted to kill that koopa
Bowser pls phanto274Bless
monkaS someone pls
i dunno anything
bowser give peril phanto274Bless
yoo GG
Pb is a PB congrats!
random! peepoWave
Jen! peepoWave
lets go rng
top 20 BLANKIES
There's Mitzi, Gengar, Rigby
Did you get speedied this run
stop doing that
good luck on runs
me and Taco just find out that Ultimate Doubles is a side-event at CB
Team with proc coward
go 0-2 with the monkey
Yea it's a matter of if you like have a friend you wanna team with or just a static
I'm sorry for that showing at PP
That's the teams I play against around here I can fuck those up
I also play wario so that helps lol
no dink pls
we'll see when speedy is first
they lost a lifeshroom to an encounter and didnt want to try LP
we go AGAIN
glgl peepoComfy
you got it this time MarioDab
but... we love prologue Kappa
Played superhot for a bit
Bumped into my closet several times and now I'm very tired
but vr works so that's cool
Esam is remaking his discord rn
And he's trying to justify his mistake
that's 6.8 seconds too many time to reset
glgl Prayge
yeah this run looks really hot
in defricken green
don't ban me taco
i just assume hes here and waiting to ban me
was playing unite with people
game is still bad but last patch actually made it much better
score shield and buddy barrier both got TURBO nerfed
so its a much more engage-heavy meta
still some broken shit
and the game itself is like... built by toddlers
but its fun
Almost as hot as goompa
lol gless suffering
ah it makes sense, you want a good time, not to *have* a good time
im jk gless is fun
i mean that's pape for you. both this and ttyd
gless is jsut ch2 and 3 suffering in ttyd yeah
yeah its like 2+ hours in
after ch3 gless is basically just purely execution
ch2 is fine except when punie jumps just dont work for no reason
my gless pb has a mere 30 minute major league
has a 26 minute wr
lol major league be like that sometimes
like 70% of major league is literally just learning alternate fights
yeah, it's a great route to finish a run
my pb is only 6:39 so it's not even good lol
yeah, that's why i had to stop running it. when even sway takes 6 hours it's just too much
the tricks in TTYD are ridiculous
AND its 60 fps
if i had unlimited time i'd rather run that than pape i think, but i don't
the biggest difference, by a gigantic margin, is b for text vs mashing
Doing a run today also :D
i enjoy speed swapping, but i could see why people wouldn't
that was fast
the biggest problem with speedswapping is having to explain it to literally every viewer
speedswapping with peach is just goofy lol *wigglewigglewiggle*
I ... hate spm. I don't enjoy that game at all.
Don't tell spm people, they will hurt me
the start of this game makes me sadge for speedrunners
im feel for you
origami king was a bad game, agreed
how did the koopa brother's get to the bowser castle and so fast down?
imagine a basically on-rails 20 minute prologue regardless of category
maybe they jumped?
and the sunshine runners thought their prologue was bad enough to romhack it
have you used that pipe in any rando?
i know there is a big difference, i'm just memeing
yeah, sms runners are insane
when do you think the next rando is?
But also sms runners are *insane* the top level play of that game is ridiculous
if i had points i could make you one :D
just wait for plando and that reward
As mean as m4 seed the other night that needed to get ultra hammer, to get ultra boots, to get kooper in toy box, to get diamond stone in volcano, to beat ch2?
hmm maybe i should do a rando, i could if i start right now
quadruple?? lmao
what do vip?
bye goombario you will not be missed
dang it
"sigh" fine but only that fight
what fight?
presumably works because jr will just slap you over and over until you do enough damage
yay for not dinking
they work for bowser and are also scared of him hehe
whoever figured out to put fright jars in this game and ttyd is an asshole btw
they're more polarized. more 90+ and more < 5s too
yeah, that one is a thing
the worst fight in glitz is shy guys. cuz with 4 enemies, anything under 95% is gonna miss a lot. and those dudes steal items
i will be back later good luck with the run
poor bombette getting slapped
yoo gl
3rd try incoming
have you just had this 2nd cart lying around lmao
i should check around me to see if there's any local stores like that now that i'm not a bum
probably yeah
not spoodlied
so excited you did lil jumps of joy for the seed
you go REAL slow with js lol
the ! shows up, you pause a full 4 seconds
i've definitely triple jumped at locks in hooktails castle before
don't forget jumping on the furniture
it's very nice indeed
got nothing to do so here i am
and i do love paper mario so
think you forgot to jump :D
jumping in front of chests now too, really spicing it up
hammer time
well so far your doing good :D
wish i was good at speedrunning
i feel like the japanse version has lower health on the bosses
dew it :3
oh no it's bowow
when i was a kid i did not like this chapter
was to scary :3
did not like the ghosted
i can finally do equip swap in mm now, getting closer to doing runs soon
fuck this boo
It's impossible to learn a second character when jesse refuses to play anything but my wario
i have to relearn snowhead tho cuz we skip fire arrow entirely now
And with the delay we have from distance I don't wanna fucking play wario
we also skip light arrow but we get it through gim in great bay which is cool
so you never go into regular stone tower
also hi taco
wifi sucks
Like the 2nd wario set there were so many times where i was right but it had to be tight movement because of my char
And then I see the ad startup or roll and I just die at 90 because the DI is for the roll
Hi morph
What if it's just some hot hoes likin what they see
Yea they're wet for good PB's
@TacoGuyy he can't escape your Wario at the AirBnB
yo glgl
yo glgl
was good, brushed up on a few things
@buff00n I literally just want to play a secondary I want to have extra chars for a couple matchups I loathe but kinda can't learn them if he won't play them with things that aren't his shitty ass wifi chars
i know it all too well Sadge
Like I don't give a fuck about the PT sora matchup on wifi that char is fake
gonna get some food and lurk, glgl man Prayge
Also literally the only reason I stopped playing pit
He refuses to ever play it with anything
So I just can't play pit against good players
Like the chars I'm trying to play are all good chars that I play offline
wonder what the bed smell's like?
dreams and tubba sweat
broken dreams
He uses old spice deodorant and he thinks that's all he needs so he doesn't shower
Hence why there's no bathroom in the mansion
and where can you get a talking key i want one
Yea mario is too busy doing this shit
So the toads shit in the bushes
why do you think that green one refuses to cooperate
He's mad at mario
I assume you got speedied
well well well :D
oh rip
let's hope you don't die then
if it's okay ask how do i become moderator?
okay :D
Buff00n's a bastard
I will join that club in october or whenever the fuck port is
Uhhh let's check the modview tab
Roguedarkjedi and aladd
Idk who they are but they're mods
And phantomgamesbot, the best mod
When will phantomgamesbot be allowed to violence post publicly
Let's feed him good
Let him weed mario
This is injustice
that's dope
Ok brb I'm being dragged to a dinner when I already ate
you will like when you move out i lived alone since i was 18 now i'm 22
i went out of state so i will be in debt forever
no encounter so we good
yeah it's really comfy
as long as you dont jump in front of the chests like 4 times it's good
ah yeah true
the timing without the trage is really weird, m4, morph, and myself were doing right side door since that's usually fine in hurricane but in spook it's really awkward and you get encountered sometimes
yeah pretty much
YEP YEP
YEP YEP YEP
YEP YEP
Lantern ghost FrogeRiot
being real on twitch is cool
are you gonna be doing risky final from now on?
yeah fair
it's a duskull though, better send it back
but that's not a Dusclops next to me, and he's good until he gets knocked off
Dusknoir makes me so sad
yeah, it's got some good looks and it's decent as a tank/spin blocker. But like you said, clops is just better
"I guess I'll shadow sneak"
does it have pursuit?
Marowak-A is scary af in trick room
is it not available now in DP due to the Home update? I haven't kept up
didn't even get BDSP
well, ORAS added the primal reversion mechanic, wheras BDSP didn't really add any new mechanics, did it?
heard you like Houndour!
I was thinking Simisear, but that was BW
yeah, they're meant to be early game bridges to help you clear the early gyms
if you chose your starter poorly
beeg circle
800mg of copium
strimmer with the false advertising. Was promised top 15
time to git gud then
phanto274Sip COPIUM
uncapped too EZ
early cycle is like 16s
the spam A quiz?
Hows the run lookin
Just be fast
we love jank
just don't get stung EZ
what's good?
today is one of those BEST DAYS EVER
so after 2 weeks the 230 everdrive didn't ship so I canceler
found a listing on ebay for 250 I was sitting on
woke up from nap and he dropped it to 170
and it has already shipped!
it's an X5
don't forget
ebay chargers 10% too
so if I got it for 100 he's only making 50 bucks
I have no interest in GBA since I just emu everything
but I get it
I only stream bizhawk in obs
could ask bn guys, Kirby could prob help
gl on rest of run; time for din din
Just won a 500 ping strive game ama
GL ANYWAY PHANTOM, GEEZ
No otherwise I wouldn't have won
It was baiken so they also couldn't do shit LOL
think i will head out gl Phantom you got this
lunch is over so gotta run. I'd like to do a glitchless rando
hard part is over jcogDab
GL my guy
hiiii I haven't watched a run of this game since at least 5 years idk wtf is happening lol
I never seen that attack tbh lolo
that tells you how outdated my knowledge on that run is
same deal with watching bug fables, the key item get is my general notif tone on pc so it gets me everytime
text tone is medal get from bug fables
so you'll run bn5 to get more rng until you get back to pm64 :)
can you
go fast
so dont do that
+28 parakarry HmmCouncil
huh i wonder what happened
my downright is suddenly so far down that I can't do early whale anymore
i found out by holding up of down right and still ending up in bounds in a run like 4 times in a row
i was -1:04 and lost 3 minutes so i just called it
i need to drop ruins jump but I'm too stubborn
help lmfao
my values arent very good for it anymore with my stick
well i figured it out
i used to be able to do it 30x in a row but i cant anymore lmao
hope it doesn't change again by tomorrow
being conservative with assuming i lose some time but not a fuckton to the rest of my splits i could've 3:10ed that run
eugh lmao
nvm it still only loses 3s to fail and use para vs not going for it
i hate this game lmao
i would still not do it unless my success rate was like 90% tbh
my mentality has changed a lot
i used to never miss this shit but my controller now is bad for it
so I'm half considering dropping it
oh i should see if my controller can do it with these diagonals
it's actually extra bad
got home early from work. GL GL phanto274Smile
yo mitzi
6:23 is hype
double mood
you look like a glitch guy
what are you doin'
welp i just got ruins jump 10x in a row remapping neutral
guess I'm doing that now Sadge
it doesnt even save 2 seconds OMEGALUL
such a silly trick
i feel like if you have to remap neutral for a trick
it probably doesn't belong in gless lmfao
this specific thing is fine imo but that just sounds so sketch
you shouldnt have to, my controller is just bad
one advantage of oem
my theory is that having higher range makes the jump easier
you will never remap neutral on accident
ive done that before trying to rebadge out of a spin
i think with my current stick it's frame perfect but it'd definitely not frame perfect if i remap
while gripping my controller
im fairly certain gc has really high range
so does hori but my hori's angles are super horrible for ruins jump i havent even come close with hori
i just realized that my struggling with bts recently is probably the same angle shift that fucked my whale
i should've known this was gonna happen
what are your cardinals
press start
press start again
and then do the test
that's fairly standard tbh
there's a newer version of the rom
that shows diagonals and has other benchmarks and stuff
up and down are a little off center but otherwise solid
a brand new oem typically has 85s for cardinals
anything 80+ is considered pretty good
all of my cardinals are 80+ except for left, which is 75
so that means my upleft and downleft are more up/down than left
gameplay is improving, ggs
yo glgl
get away phantom while you still can
pape is not worth it
gotta dip for now but hope your fright jars are scary and your spins are speedy Prayge
TIFF MADE THE PERFECT Pepega SHAPE ON ACCIDENT
IT'S SO GOOD
I'll send it on disc with the emote it's so perfect
Also gl
Just don't get speedied and kill everyone perfectly
I love the song that repeats itself every 15 seconds!!!!
Yo turn it up this shit goes hard
fuck it's over
Mario Slander is Cringe He's just as awesome as all the other Super Mario Characters, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'basic'. FREAKING LOVE MARIO!1!1!>:(
should've made it Wario to prevent the ban
Wario Slander is Cringe He's way more awesome than all the other Nintendo, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'hot as fuck'. FREAKING LOVE WARIO!1!1!>:(
I hope 'hot as fuck' gets used by your bot soon
Goomnut on these bitches
what'd arie do
I should probably setup the new monitor so I can see the m4 chat
Chat loaded and I just see "c o r r u p t i o n"
How hard is the 2nd part
I know the first is fp
Very cool
heyo glgl
gl gl
Thanks! SO CLOSE bepisCry
just makes me want it that much more
that's like ONE encounter I cry
first run of the night? :D
I wish there was some pape in the sgdq lineup
Pape so comfy. Would be great for gdq
stop and swap is different
what is stop and swap?
Imagine how much better the world would be if those bills were just all at once on a pattern
I will EAT a Fright Jar if this run PBs. I will crack the lid with my teeth and suck out all of that sweet fright juice. Then, I'll insert the jar in my mouth and begin crunching. Once it has been reduced to several sharp chunks, I will unleash it into my unsuspecting stomach. After that, it's up to my doctor. That is how confident I am that this run is dead.
this song goes so hard
hggGun ok
tf: give him speedy
youtube viewers modCheck
they'd have my back
I'm down
I like glitches
Bro there's nothing attached just do the funny jumps
we do a lil pondering
Count the frames lazy ass
you got speedied with speedy in hand
glitched rando is cool, even if i can really only do LP skip, some laki clips, and maybe bhs
so cute
THEIR NOSES ARE SO BUG
I WANNA BOOP EM
definitely a big head code
AND THERES BIRDS
my ovaries oh my lord what is this masterpiece
AS YOU SHOULD
oh my

WHAT AN OLD MAN DOG
these game devs knew what was up. Dog content is the best bepisLoveCat
absolute downgrade
we need to go back
absolutely adorable
milk man looks like... he would sell you Adderall
for sure
doggy Adderall
this game deserves an award
speedrun requires you to be nekkid?
gotta feel the breeze
man so I guess theres no public indecency laws on dog island
dog village
dog world
the way your doggo runs
oh no the sad doggo music
wow what a sham of a dog doc
we do all of this for our bro?
the deck looks clean already tho
D: i guess I'm blind
DOGGO GOES FISHING?
straight bangers this game has
I would reset this game just cause i could
listen to that intro again
Which of these fuckers is making the deck dirty
fuck the mailman

@buff00n Buff00n needs an ego boost before I shit on him at combo breaker
TacoGuyy refuses to let me know peace
Simply don't lose
Also I have 66.9k channel points rn
@buff00n tbh, we're prolly gonna do drunk Ganon dittos
Why is it in Japanese? I'm surprised the words ain't in English
You can probably put it to English in settings I think???
I grew up playing this game I chose a golden retriever
Oh that's awesome!
To match amalia?
As I understand it if your a female the victory gang is your romantic interests but if your male amalia is one but who else
I did all the quests lol also poor Peter he's in love with amalia
Er princely paws I guess lol
I did know
Who's it supposed to go to though?
I wonder if your female if Alex can be a love interest
He was my favorite because when I was a kid I loved his riddles
Camu is one so is McCoy I don't know if there's a third
Are u playing wii now?
Hell yes I agree
Imagine if they included the actual animal of the crab and it could pinch your pups nose
I find it a shame that not a lot of people play this anymore it was a really adorable and fun game
I never liked Petz 2 or 1 for that matter
I preferred the dog island
Do you wanna hear something funny
The night before I got this game I dreamed of cute dogs and running around through a meadow the next day dad gave me a random wii game and this was it
I was like 11 I'm 23 now and I still love this game
How many speed runs are there for this game?
A shame honestly..
Scooby doo cyber chase was a fun game
Cyber chase was my first game on ps2 I ever played scooby doo was a fun game
Cute giraffe :3
They really had fun working on the cute aspect of this game huh?
I got distracted, where in the story are we?
Got it
Another ps 2 game I loved was 102 Dalmatians
It's old really old lol
Strong puppy ^^

Cronos won anyway because nikita

the flowers were so nice
I miss Boris every day
YO THERE'S A FLOWER
I love emotes like this because it puts mobile viewers through hell
Chikorita I like this emote
This emote is based

Chikorita gg
Oh I was literally typing for you to raid sway LOL
I was not expecting to enjoy this game as much as I did
I have that on the other tab
This game is lit
thank you for showing me this
Where's the milk he went to get
Fuck this guy
the whining noise is killing me
Whine ... aww
oh its a glitched rando today?
ah fair, glgl anyway
but.. why, discord people? i can only do a few that matter and it's still neat to do/try

Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on viewers. shop (viewers. shop)!

Ive clicked one of their links before back when they still did links. Websites are ugly as hell haha. They really care about their scams LUL
I hate mario
I love baking cake

I love this part
I think about dog island sometimes btw thank you for introducing me to that game

my schedule is poopy now
I heard you had a glitch that has only ever happened one other time? UNLUCKY

Charizard is so fucking fun
I gotta show you what I hit jaemi with later LOL
BombWave yo

Don't forget the star piece in the flowers
are you excited for Summer games fest
I don't mean gdq
it's basically E3
all the companies are going to big there even Microsoft and Sony but not Nintendo
Did you go back and get the star piece in the flowers?
What do you think of Coney's current stream title
it's very good
That's how weed mario was born
"Sorry dear, I just rolled THE WORST blunt."
At least you're not in peril currently
Wow this is a LONG long speedrun
Nice job again on GDQ yesterday btw!
I was thinking about doing it sometime later this week
Will they post your run btw or should we like archive it?
Ok cool
i didnt get past speedy
i only did 3 attempts tho
yeah i saw that lmao
i've been watching while i was in prologue
is this glundo?
who redeemed this!?
also whats good
i got a 1 minute gold on knightman today, crazy how easy it is to save time when you derust
to get familiar again
dalus and I are doing commentary on komari's run
they asked me to do it, was glad to have carpal tunnel excuse ready. Dont wanna get on a stage like that
finding energy to stream has been hard for me recently
I just feel tired all the time
like I was off yesterday and still didnt go live
FUCK GOOMBA ROAD
consistent is my favorite word
my expansion pak has shipped so ill be able to practice soon
also send me a seed for what you think my first rando should be
its gonna be a train wreck, havent really played beyond chapter 5 LMAO
cant be worse than laichan phanto274Shrug
poor girl, she has been live for 1 and a half hours and only has boo portrait, and 2 seeds
you hate to see it
all badges, star pieces, and.... tattles KEKW
oh receipies
submit this for really really long a thon
I came up with some new BN23 head canon today
Arashi's mission to gas Yai was to get funds so they could hire Dusk to attack yumland and electopia :mindblown:
what do you do before chapter 8?
basically everything?
[all the side quests]
do you max partners too?
bowser cheats
he gets a buff and attacks on the same turn
he uses the star rod to make mario skip a turn OMEGALUL
fun stuff?
do you save all of quizmo for now or do you do some on the way?
whats in goomba village
I was about to meme about all the mushroom in the inn, then I realized this is vanilla OMEGALUL
imagine knowing this game well enough to run glundo in jpn
Coney is watching strikers gameplay and it looks very... dull
It looks very slow
GL, gonna go say hi to others running pape tonight
And all your attacks having big arrows showing you charge them and you have a dodge button
gotta support this community
Coney is very sad
They at least have good goal celebration animations
yeah, new strikers doesn't interest me
and that's before the lack of Daisy
2 yeah
couldve been worse COPIUM
I hate Rune Factory 5
He can't milf hunt
WHY DOES THIS GAME PRESENT ME WITH LADIES THAT ARE 100% MY TYPE, THEN TELL ME I CAN'T BLOODY HAVE THEM
He wants to wreck homes
THIS SUCKS
I'd rather hear playground
jenysrMips Jeny raid jenysrMips
jenysrMips GL
oh no he says KEKW
jenysrMips Gl phantom!!
I have to do some things so I will be back in a few!!
did you hand in the mailbag? thats my guess LUL
ask merluvlee FeelsOkayMan
is this a chat assisted speedrun jcogLUL
just don't call it a TAS bc then you're calling us all tools NiceSoftlock
ive been called worse
oh no
glitchless 100.99% category when?
Improvement is improvement. We take what we can get
Is this route new?
Oh cool!
How does safe ending differ from the risky one? I have yet to look at the routes
Hmm I see
Hai hai. :D
Don't sound so enthused to see me, gosh.
I'm diving into glitchless today actually. Making some notes for myself on the route then practicing some specific chapters. Should be a couple days until I run it
Nope but I am all ears
Yeah I'm doing safe route
Power bouncing huff. Yeah I think chapter 6 in general is gonna be one of those I need to practice. Same with 7
You say that but yo those mirrors and knowing where to go mess me up lol
Honestly everything is on the practice list lmao
Oh yeah chapter 4 might be tough too for me. Lol it's just a lot but I'm excited to learn
Oh absolutely
Uh yes. I want to
Not sure if I can't
Oh cool! I be sure to look for that when I get there
madman really out here doing mega bomb
Rigby235: m
pb with mega bomb PAUSERS
mx_four: Rigby235:
yo Ryan
hellowo fowevew
and ghl
that was a typo, but let's say it stands for good heckin' luck
I'll miss my #freecannonless movement but I'm super happy with this rando update
Good heckin luck
same. that was my big issue too
What is this chapter eight that you speak of?
trick question. speedrunners don't know what chapter 8 is
also hi Ryan
Have you ever done any Thousand Year Door stuff?
What about any%? Ever thought about learning glitches for said game?
Arent the tricks like crazy hard in TTYD
I wanna see a phantom palace skip
yeah exactly. 60 fps frame perfect monkaS
What about the abomination that is Origami King? LuL
Mario out here using the Kirby hammer for a moment.
it took me an embarrassingly long time what you meant by laki fight. was trying to figure out which fight we use laki for
forgot we actually fight the dude
in a rando streamer now and we don't fight laki idk
You don't want to have to run some Refund backup strats? :D
quit dreamin pal
this is why i don't run anymore
i got too many tastes of the doogan dong and i didn't like it
doogan dong
hm odd
So, please explain the "MegaBomb%" bit to me.
The madlad.
That's... certainly a strategy.
Sounds time consuming, yeah.
Mistakes? Mn... Steaks. I miss steaks.
rowf is an air raid fan
my pb is 6 you can do it
go phantom go!
6th try
he's doing it!!!
New WR incoming.
so close
Mission failed successfully.
7???? holy crap
Sometimes, video games just say no.
now I have nothing Sadge
my pb is also 6th i think
m4 is 6 as well iirc
6 6 6 monkaS
do it with your highlight attached lmfao
yeah i agree
I love that attitude.
if i get worse than first try i want it to be really bad
in the last 56 runs i've only gotten worse than 2nd try once and it was 3rd
i think total 1st try is still just over 75% for me
which i'll take lmao
oh yeah i guess overall i have no clue what my rng is
i could maybe find out if i looked at my split files but idc about my old ones as much
yo glgl
yeah like before i started my grind i could still pb with either a fail or second try or both bc that happened once at 3:44 lmfao
not that i cant now but like eh
Doing a run i see :D
something happend i'm guessing?
0.000244140625 is 0.25^6
then * .75 would be 7th try right
well if you fail agian do rando :3
like in rando you can't fail :)
why do we need all the peach segments
and get that gomba away
imagine playing glitchless at all tbh
he got you there hehe
new category extension?
just woke up from a late nap
maybe can stream later
its storming pretty hard here
Hikari doesnt like storms
sometimes shell come in here and shake at my feet
best song
The castle theme is so nice
Oh no. I stepped away for a few minutes, and we've reset again. D:
What happened this time?
Ah, okay.
you excited about it?
finally someone with an honest opinion
looks like every other arena fighter and throw in every direction
hey look we are back where i joined hehe
we went back in time
oh shit, komaris is starting soon
same they have to use buster up
ive seen someone do it
maybe method?
thats how long its been LUL
bn2 buster only is the dumbest thing ever
remember before shadowman?
you can hit him with buster but frame perfect, so its 12 frame perfect charge shots before style change
then you need heat style for null and void in undernet
bn3 you need heat style for bass aura
in bn33 id run kawarimi on navicust
bn3, you know
hides behind a rock
phantom, did you know im a mitzi bro for life
mitzi bro
I need a bro emote now LUL
Just for axl
there are so many "If this happens do this" in the route
oof, sounds like komari is peaking
Yeah just trying to make the notes not hurt my brain as much
speednotes live
speed GUIDES live ok
ill look into ti
wait phantom, dont they have to do falzar?
how would you clear matches classes?
you cant reach the back
or I mean you cant do fire dmg
I didnt know such a thing as speedguides existed phanto274Hype ty ty I shall use it
i wonder if gregar is even possible
getting heat cross sounds like the killer
this morning I got home at 6:30... damn i missed the end of mitzi's run KEKW
imagine getting reflectr from robodog comp LUL
its easier since it only has mettaur encounters
but very slow
yoo congrats
congrats!! welcome to the cool kids club
Yaaaas ty ty <3
I can officially move on to glitchless for a while
cursed cartridge
send axl old cart?
like the name :D
perfect LUL
phantom is too good for us!!!!
is this update live?
letters sounds gross
i mean yea idek those rewards never did that shit lol
yeah id take default out of the rotation
so each FP move cost -2?
mario went boom
nice glitch bruh
fun where i live it's raning :D
ToyBox Hype!
fire kammy LUL
crystal ball?
what does that give you in vanilla?
hehe rigby is playing paper mario to :D
go fast
i'm here all the way Phantom
icebox buster only
i'm happy i found you here on twitch :D
this this the glundo? Kappa
waiting on the run back
hehe blue watt
1FP but flower saver so how does that work?
so i tried killing fuzzypede without watt by ending with volt shroom. but in the dark fuzzy just heals himself F
i just did it to see if the next cutscene would have a different partner text box
she is sick
curious to try auto kill and practice rom to see what happens
chapter 5 music is the best :D
yo? my game shop got Intellivision II system and loads of CIB games
i have no way to connect it tho
thats 2nd gen right?
FOR GAME PRESERVATION!!
boxed copy of he-man omg
diveman oof
sub 1:45
nah, just the kids
all this talk about buster only
but what about hamme ronly Kappa
i wish that dried shroom was a trap OMEGALUL
whats the badge?
i never noticed marios face on it lol
nice check there buddy
i be gone maybe 15 min gl
did they really take an ad break during the middle of the run?
they stopped komaris run to run run some ads
umm ... no
cream party?
i say chapter 2
you waiting on weight for chapter 3?
btw I order my ps5 panels
the went for preorder this week
have the purple controller so want it to match
buy weed everyday phanto274Jam
i tired the expansion pak again today and no luck
tried 2 differrent jumper paks and it booted fine
mark said he has an extra and will hook me up
why is the weight lower on the list?
then why is goombario at the very top Kappa
i had no idea what that was, "is that a tumor???"
how is the run going?
why cant you sell?
makes sense, he needs to store those items somewhere OMEGALULA
missed the caplock at the end there LUL
that looks so much easier
mitzi take notes
as long
someone scalping star pieces
oh no he is dead
i love you dont have laki yet
it's very sad that we don't have laki :c
lakileister? more like lack luster Kappa
laki where are you :c
5 years later
grabbed a drink, what was in the chest?
a bomb
wish it was a laki trap just to spite you KEKW
Maybe with that attitude it's too much
hey dawg those text boxes aren't randomized, I was promised everything being random
twitch just gave me an ad on the main page for condoms
dont they know that this page is for gamers?
Runs didn't go well, I take it?
wow, ghost goomba.
is it the one that has a call of duty-type loadout screen?
shocked that star piece stayed the same
know your demographic twitch!
I'm okay with more randos.
you can explore chapter 6 right
ive never properly played oot on n64 so will be starting that off stream soon
need to find a good button layout
how do wii do it?
just add a mic attachment and hum the songs
that sounds clean
oh boy playing songs that were meant to use a d pad on a joystick aint fun try playing pac man with a regular non arcade joystick
sub 2 at elementman
the colored plants are cannibals... huh.
I've been playing the original Zelda with my daughter on Switch with a pro controller and it's so difficult because of the D-pad. I tried the stick but noped out of that real quick
thats the run GG
are those phantom coins?
if we get goombario in the place of mega rush that will be so disappointing
ooh chapter 3 opening up
is therre a story behind the name phantom?
wanna know pain? try playing sm64 without a z button and doing bomb clip as the FIRST STAR OF THE CHALLENGE
laki can go over lava but not water
when did you get weight?
That letter was a bomb. That's messed up.
I just looked down and thought "whats the green ultra stone" LUL
dont remember if I asked you or if it was someone else.,.,.
is yoshi cookie made from yoshi?
HE KNOWS THE LORE
you should know koopa fortress would have traps
nice they dont have the "partner joiined your party"
its the real one this time KEKW
i missed it but komari did indeed show off the parasol cutscene
in sky town
spider is still the best
oh wait i forgot
MEGAMAN ATTACK!!!
yeah, bn3 has the best one lol
rip harry's shop
oh! thats how you do colonel quick kill
it prevents him from summoning the soldier
you have to hit him before he moves again but he has i frames so its tight
so hit him twice on the same panel
did you upgrade hammer?
this is chap 7 tutenkoopa aint it
it DID in fact do damage even if its 1
clean fight
Cheer100 Cheer100 GET FUCKED NERD
get rainbows nerd OMEGALUL
i need to give 600, not in any rush
is there any reason to pick power bomb over mega bomb?
does mega do more dmg?
yo!! gavel skip
going into judgemanEX with 1 HP
the book got im LUL
yeah, i have no idea how the book works
gavel got him KEKW
book in his front row
he's choking on gavel now
3 times in a row failed
its bad unless you are risch
they have those same hit boxes in mother comp too
when you do the passwords
oh no
he's doing judge with beastout
thats so cringe
oh damn i missed his beast fight
I see a really big problem here.
You have Goombario.
thats a blessing
That's not a Watt, this is a Watt.
And all this to go save the Princess? I dunno... Effort vs Reward...
I'm not huge on this Bow color.
your going strong i see
green tubba :D he is also sick
question about your audio
your mic doesnt pick up your game audio since you dont have headphones?
im sure I dont need mine but I love my headphones
have audio technia m40x
now for mario to smell the bed
oh letter insanity is new?
wait why do you have goombario with you?
???? What's that teal Ultra Stone???
oh, yeah
I forgot
I mean, it IS the same sprite as the Ultra Stone tho
so I'm not TECHNICALLY wrong
that was easy
weird, but not unwelcome
kinda miss the lightning, ngl
EXCUSE ME
THAT'S OD
why would you ever not just nuke everything
what do you missing?
oh no
does the chest do anything in rando?
YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER *misses*
Master does better when he stops talking shit
this seed's pain
50 years later
this is kinda like 100% run hehe
this seed is evil
we in go mode?
its been 5 hours my guy!
your on the final goal now :D
sub 6 lets go!!
but 1FP bomb is worth it
have a wild clip to share
yo glhf
i got to final but my lategame was shit
lost a min to final anyway lmao
holy shit lmao
holy shit
does the new setting let Mario do the smart thing and fly straight to Bowser
wasn't wrong then
I WAS KIDDING
once we get the konami collection
what do you mean?
thats all konami does now
a konami collection that isn't bugged to Hell n' back
I just made myself worried about that TMNT collection
the cowabunga collection
cuz I'll grab that if it's a functional experience
im not worried, its by digital eclipse the same guys the did megaman legacy collec ... nevermind
but phantom it has power fighters ... POWER FIGHTERS!!!
is it possible to just power thru and win on phase 1?
i hate stuff like that, bn3 has the bass fight you cant win
btw, how is routing going?
my seed hurt me. did yours hurt you?
nope not at all
how much of Koopa koot did you do?
chased a moth out of my room lol
is this what they call "god tier rng"?
HI YOUTUBE
why do you do this to yourself
you skip checks,
then it bites you
mine ane m4s seed had....
anti guy had ice palace key. seed behind 4th ruins key, which we got from a letter which was found in palace. Goomba king had tubba key. master 1 had star stone. Koopa koote 18th request had tubba key. so lantern ghost had luigis autograph
Do it again in under 4 hours and 40 minutes
What do you mean unlucky
You have goombario
when is quizsanity
Make it a 100k point reward
Nobody WANTS to play it
It's just really funny
Like sploosh kaboom + auction rando for WW
If m4 isn't you can raid sway
Sway just started
on alt
I like that your tracker shows spirit order now
Old ass
"This was a seed" Drake
Is it me or did you shave?
hello friendo
rando bullied me
time for me to make another Megamind meme
couldnt figure out how to clear a single chapter
not having bomb, para, or bow walled me out of chapter 2 3 and 4
may god rest your soul, you are going to play park dear god
selling ultra jelly was hype
I made meme and put in #memes
If you get speedy you get the other half of weed mario
You have to earn it
too bad he gets it anyways
Streaming multiversus would just be free stream content but like
I just don't want to play it lol
just play Jake Jake
*Jake, Jake
multiversus is not fun to watch lol
Like I got top 100 and top 5 with my char I really don't care lol
My classic play of getting high enough rank to say a game sucks
Jake called Finn Jake and he said that's his name now, so I told him that'll be his name as well
yo glgl
beating glenn on the leaderboard should be easy lol
I really hope it gets better cause the ideas are there
It's just not fun yet for me
Yea I was top 60 before I stopped
Singles I refused to touch lol
No good players are being voted in to the gimvitational so far lol
Crowned should be supported not this bullshit lol
We need to get crowned to actually break even they lost fucking 10k from sponsors because gimr had to flex his microdick
Also who wants to fucking campaign 50k to go to a hazards tourney at a horse track
The only other thing is coneys house but you can't go there unless you spend 99million channel points
Yea combo breaker is gonna have a billion things at the venue and I also know that area and there's a lotta good food and shit
Didn't port get shit on by a SWT event last year
Sounds about right
Now that they're done gimr said hold my beer
And gives 0 shits now
And people wonder why Ceo, ricks events, and anything bts wouldn't opt in to swt
Gimrs current event structure just shits out events with no prize pool just to get viewership
And every event i hear the same exact issues with everything in the venue lol
Well bighouse fucked theirs anyway
shit I didn't get to vote
I mean did gamble
I'm tired
splatoon is a joke too! grand prize is a jacket, a switch case, no prize money? get the fuck out!
oh they get 10K platinum points cant forget that one!
That might be why the panda circuit is taking a while they might be fixing that fingers crossed
Where gimr has enough setups to run bracket and then takes everything down the split second top whatever starts
Yea top players live off content anyway, tourney money is just extra
Yea I literally am only going to double down because jesse
Their modded setups are ASS
Mods should stay out of bracket
Like if anyone ever wanted me to turn off my shit when I bring my switch for whatever I would just do it cause idc if I only have colors and a few songs it just makes sense
I mostly bring mine for training mod and friendlies
whats your take on slippy for events?
oh wow
Yea it was just a couple dudes making it in free time I don't imagine it'd be groundbreaking lol
Like they did a good job but it's not absurd
thats so funny
luigi skip frame by frame
whats the most recent release? I have fp-1.1.0
yeah he gave it to me, should still have the link
when I arrived to the fortress blue koopa bro came out "YO ITS LEONARDO!!!"
They should make npc model rando
time to scramble an egg into an omelette
just ordered pape jpn... and thats everything. Can finally stop spending money on this game LUL
people do that?
m4 is testing new controllers hopefully they stop getting fucked for random tricks they can't do
hammer cancel is s w a g though
im mean i dont plan on grinding or anything
thats very fair
i mean with having eng and jpn on ED thatll give me 4 copies for saves lol
Top 4 of the local today was steve, cloud, steve, steve
get me out
Jaemi lost to only steve at advantage state and got 3rd
2 locals in a row had 3 steves in top 4
Actually what was the fuckin top 8 for fridays local I forgot about that one
Ok failbot didn't go yesterday so it was only TWO steves in top 4
The steve that's not mirai or failbot though sucks idk how he's getting top 4's
I've played him once and he just did layer 1 shit and I fucked him up lol
And he tried his pocket hero and proceeded to burn all his mana while I walked away
Heros other specials are really good
stage 2 side b is absurd
But yea minnesota has gone from the megaman state to the steve state
these fucks hate fun
I gotta send you a clip tho of something jaemi did to a steve on wednesday
Cause the ones that aren't failbot are genuinely mashers
Yeti got banned from AS because of a misunderstanding and they never reverted it after he privately cleared things up with the actual person involved
I think he's back in like a month or 2
he apologized and got banned still
He was friends with that person prior and after though they commentated together at the last 2 AS's he was at before being banned and I'm pretty sure that was after the thing happened lol
At least if it was who I think it was
Oh yea between the megaman era and the steve one there was also all the megamen playing minmin for a bit before she got nerfed
The minmins never won anything though because loaf existed
The one dlc pass2 matchup that's just really good for wario lol
get the maple in tubba's castle
Visitor just salt tweeted about steve and all the mn people are in the replies knowing it's a salt tweet/joke tweet and everyone from the other parts of twitter are MAD
Yay smash Twitter
Like visitor was megaman and minmin MN knows he's not allowed to tweet about characters
I follow the top players whose content I like and people in region
The rest of my twitter is art or fgc
speaking of fgc
Fgc is so much nicer to follow than smash it's crazy, like there's still shitheads but the overall group is so much better to look at
ya love to see it
buff00n I'm in a smash mood go set up your shit
There's a char I wanna fuck around with that jibca has inspired me to retry
I do not fathom the people play Miis in the Nintendo-3rd-party smorgasbord fighting platformer game
The rollback felt wack in doubles but in 1v1 it felt good
Did you plug a wire into your ps5 or were you still running wifi
I figured LOL
Like if you didn't plug it in for strive I doubted you would for multi
I've been playing unwired because I've been too lazy to make the hole mine is going through larger for 2 wires and it's felt more or less the same lol
When we got this current router tho I just stopped having packet loss issues at all on wifi on my pc
Ps4 tho I still had to wire because that shit sucks and mainly why I got pc strive LOL
Yea if the speeds are pretty much the same and you're not getting packet loss you really don't need to lol
A quarter of gigabit is still like 10x better than what most people are running LOL
Guess who is back to watch my favorite stremer :D
Fanart has sold me on Ingrids design for 3hopes
Although everyone draws the hair way nicer than it actually is lol
I've not played that game type since i played warriors 1 like a year and a half ago so I'm just in the mood for it
speedrun hyrule warriors when
witch one there is two
FE warriors was so close to being really good
the story is okay gameplay meh
If they just didn't 3ds post exclusively and didn't have clones I would like it so much more
I was mad that the fates chars were the ones with unique shit because I didn't want to play them
Falco doesn't deserve fun
you got the maple, right?
@TacoGuyy was eating
I'm ready
oh you never responded to it so I didn't setup lol
I haven't gotten my setup out since as gimme a sec lol
@buff00n lobby up
just be like morph he don't think
same that's why I can't sleep ever lol
do a glitch TF2John
that's not
the emote I wanted
why did it complete to that
what the fuck even is that emote
TF2John who is tf2 john
why is he
He is not safe hggMickey
wow buff00n was the first one ready but heavy day has already looped once
and he aint here
Least this song slaps
Ok back to goldlewis theme
modCheck still an empty lobby
how many guilty gear songs will I burn through before he shows up
None of these songs are short either lol
lobby is more dead than buff00ns punctuality
BITCH MAKE ME WRONG FOR ONCE PLEASE
was talking to my mum
get the game right dumbass
also lobby is back up
PROLOGGERS YO WHEN WAS THIS ADDED
oh yeah go fast
almost forgot
dont go fast
spite him
the moment I threw out that dtilt I said "ah, right. Super armor"
y'know I forgot about wing armor too
I just wanted to poke the floor
im imagining kolorado puking on the SSTuna
have you played harvest moon 64?
same here i loved it
i got it cheap at a movie rental
remember buying used games at movie rentals?
i forgot sushie is purple
new strats?
I was lurking in a stream with pape 64 HD textures, really dont like how it looks honestly. Feels like the personality of the partners are gone
wait on cardboard mario
paper mario X Labo
im not
nintnedo doesnt do things that make "too much sense"
a new glitch!?!?
its something that happens in this speedrun
ive seen that in speedruns
just not glitchless KEKW
i approve of using bombette more
you didnt even use bombette tho
oh? I didnt notice
mustve been out of it
I forgot it was yoshis I can't do that and live
"he's falling kinda fast- oh"
yea I inputted fastfall after the fair instead of before so it maintained the speed lol
but rando is fun :D
that i can see hehe
run rando and a different speed game LUL
do ttyd rando
if it existed then maybe
smrpg rando
WW rando is genuinely pretty fun every now and then
and it's like the most beginner friendly tricks
so is there only paper mario that has rando in the era?
i see
uh oh
i turned on turbo and dont know how to turn it off LMAO
fair enough
turbo socpens2FAST
ive never actually played it
despite having a snes mini
I do NOT understand the hype behind Geno
I had a snes growing up but it just had smw, all stars, and aladdin
even yoshis island?
aladdin fucking SLAPPED tho
CANnot fathom why people love Geno
jesse has bad taste
tbf, I like SMRPG for it's music, graphics humor
and nonsense
Me and my sibling found star world before we had access to the internet and our minds were fucking blown
SMB3 > SMW
stop spittin'
I grew up with both and I never liked 3
you're flooding my house
with facts
stop being unlucky
I had a sega, brother had a snes. But he lived with his grandmother [we had different dads] we hung out ever other weekend. Sometimes he would surprise me and bring his snes over. Then eventually he gave it to me. I still have it.
I dont wanna hear it
I had an atari 2600 until I got my sega OMEGALUL
irememberr the controller more than the games KEKW
Oh yea the other game my snes had was american ff3
Brother had a Genesis, Uncles had a Genesis and SNES
and that's the only ff game I ever played
so I had the best of both worlds
do you like them or hate them?
one thing I love about black pit is shortcuts when fightings, like C up is jump, c right is hammer ect.
I'm slowly learning that sephiroth can kinda do the things I want
He does what I wanted ike to do but then he can actually fucking move
i love seeing duck hunt
Raito is playing banjo now so we have 0 duck hunts
I missed seeing void wrecking shit with pichu
out of the gate that shit was hype
lightning loops LUL
I like watching dabuz if he's playing rosa
Puppet chars are always cool to me
it'd be really funny
i broke the practice rom lol
was on goomba road loaded a warp and i picked up the star rod then it crashed
i only tried to go to toad town
y'know I didn't like the situation I got put in for being right
I was correct on him swinging then my octoslash traded and got me kill combod offstage because he had less hitstun
shield breaker, baybeeeeeeee
feeling pretty tired so calling it here
uhhhhhhh can you skip this on JP?
Marth would've killed that
If you were marth I don't think I'd ever lose my wing before I cap out the damage
only one way to find out
that should've been tipper when you got that 2nd wing
there I could play the game since we weren't on lylat
This char not it on slants lol
go approximately 45.5 seconds faster
he bolted
not even tipper fsmash feels satisfying
this character SUCKS
I just broke buff00ns ankles
Shimmied the fuck out of a grab
gl with the run PogChamp
I only know the Green Meadows part of the run so seeing the other levels will be cool
PAPER POKEMON 64, WOWIE!!!! MY FAVORITE GAME!!!!
I'm shiny hunting Eevee in Arceus and I got a shiny Carnivine
Haunted and Granite zone are my personal favs
Gotta love motion controls
Better than the dog island sled racing tho
gtg but gl with the rest of the run!
nice obstacles
all friends Pog
wait idk you ran this!
yeah but steam deck and crippling warioware addiction so I didn't check twitch lol
I actually got my first 100 in a warioware set
was pretty pog
Hi Phantom and Chat! Saw your Dog Island run recently and had a lot of fun. :)
Yup, the GDQ one
I love Paper Mario. I don't know what Battle Network 6 looks like, I think I saw the beginning of 3 and I was mindblown by the manips ...
6 has no manips
I have no idea what those mean xD Guess I gotta wait till I catch you streaming it :P
Why'd you hit him
what you didn't have was mercy
Don't know about that either o: Sorry I still have a lot to learn haha
and she wanted to throw hands
I went positive on jaemi with my seph in friendlies today tho
I hit my footstool shit it's pretty simple on falco hitboxes because of the hitstop
But yea it's very satisfying to have falco dair my shield and I stop on him and impale him
is this pokemon the best one for this?
The minigame glenn has played for like 50 hours
clearly ... they used their own secret wood stash
item sliding oneeMonkas
Fridge when are we making a Bridge emote
oh shit there's a fridge on a bridge emote
you should make me a 7tv editor
I need to add gerberwott
0.49 seconds O_o
He's tied at worst on all of them I think
Me saying he played 50 hours was not exaggerated
He had way too much patience for it
He would just do 8 hour streams of that shit
That's some dedication xD
Speaking of dedication, imma go nap for a bit, how much longer do you stream for?
I'd play this map in hots
hey phantom I called mid rigby2NinOko
Lowkey this is the layout of cursed mines LOL
BloodTrail awesome, good luck with the rest of the run, though you'll gold every split it seems
The only thing mid is you
Ok I have to leave for the strive local in like 5 minutes so I should get ready
have fun making friends and murdering baby pokemon
I already know glalie fucks I'll survive
16 minute gold?
skill issue
this minigame was my GOAT when i played this game LUL
blaziken is def the worst
how do they keep track
for all we know we couldve been the 1026th visitor
ight well anyways imma lurk now, gl on the power of friendship
yay it's still going lol
that music reminded me a bit of mario, ngl
in casual, what else are berries for? you have way too many
Okay. I'ma need you to explain yourself on this one.
Nothing to say for youself? KEKWait
Did you ever play Hey You, Pikachu! on the N64?
I never had any issues with it.
I might go play some DBD for a bit, but, this is certainly something.
Good.. uh... luck?
Good.. good job.
I think.
ooh rando
the way Watt was positioned for a sec, I thought you had to buy her from Ralph
I love the Waluigi color, but I don't care even the slightest about Waluigi himself
it's backwards, I admit that
I instinctively almost asked "why"
these Boos know what's up
the turtle gives you the "Slow Go" badge
How was park driving from work
what is a short rando? starting with 3 cards?
I've never seen the train smash the rock
you know you don't wanna save the yoshis
don't let the challenge runners hear that
Laki can do lava but not water?
Laki isn't waterproof
I like the red penguins
but you can't use his ability right?
Can't believe that penguin fuckin died
no it's not
what is that copypasta
@Glennjaamin No I have not, thank you for asking
Np TacoGuy
why's the temple still in the sand
HOLY MOLY
then how'd you get the star spirit
yee I doing rando
I'm 3 hours in and I STILL haven't found Parakarry
I even have everything to beat Ch 3
it's just like "where the hell are you hiding"
I also think more coconuts were added
I have found waaay more than I usually do
this seed SUCKS
excuse me
thats a sin
that was a little worth it
fried goomba on the menu tonight
do you have blue key?
oh wait you have red key
what a tease
thank you Koover
Parakarry had a crash landing
no bubble tree?
He crashed his Xbox
hey hey hey
thats true
it wasn't my fault kinda
Speaking of crashes?
Coley's cursed
uh oh
THAT'S A YIKES FROM ME, DOG
I CURSED THE STREAM NotLikeThis
oh god you had lettersanity turned on??
please title the yt video as "Short Rando(?)"
oh Redd is chill
cya dude gn LUL
have you ever been in a situation where your diglet couldnt evolve when it was on like donkey Kong.. its like you needed a Mario to make it bigger but instead you get a from Mario Kart.. but it was like sonic the hedgehog but over before it started with no continues.. so you lay down like snorlax really embarrassed.. its like you need a majoras mask to cover yourself in front of princess Peach.. not the castle you wanted to show her
the decor on the castle made me think Piplup was the one talking about being cold to friendship
ah, I never got a chance to play this as a kid it's so cute! Also hey hey, GL on learning the route!
LUL -SpAtk? ouch
Golem is very friend shaped
how is iron so rare? in almost every other game ever it's gold that's hard to get
oh wow so that was really good but really bad rng LUL LUL LUL
oh jeez
... casually spinning pokemon into molten lava? what a charming game WutFace
I didn't study for no pop quiz
oh heck, tank controls on a wiimote? that's gross
platforming??? oh I gotta see that
you keep inching him closer to the lava and I'm gettin WORRIED
.... so he won't battle you? guy's a big chicken
aw heck yeah spooky time
I mean I'd not wanna meet a Tangrowth down a dark alley bro LUL
scary parties you say?
waggle warrior time
Cranidos OP LUL
I was not emotionally prepared for such a spooky Pokmon
to whom do I send my therapy bill
He more or less caused this run to happen in some shape or form
It's a very long pipeline but it does connect to him
I mean I would've
He goes to advantage states
I should run park 2 again I need a run on SRC that's not our co-op run I didn't contribute in LOL
Let's just race park 1
Park 1 doesn't ha e oshawott
So I will play 2
Park 1 has Jolteon in pre-game tho
Park 2 is post so ew
Also shake requirements
Only thing better about Park 2 is the dance zone mini game
I will be a waggle warrior for oshawott
Let's do the 3p 380 soon :)

my eevee pb doesn't have rhyhorn
my first 3:0x was so good except for that lol
i wonder how much time it loses to miss that
i feel like it's gotta be at least like 30 but overall it isn't bad
it's also worse the longer you don't have pony

Chikorita hesitated before following you in, she did it on purpose
go fast already
you go fast
dont wanna
maybe tm
you saved me, i was so bored i was tempted to play danganropa
so thx btw
Bulbasaur's a bro
i usually get treeko and my swing dependents are either aipom/ambipom or buizel/floatzel
hide and seek peasant smh
aipom would be across bridge by mankey
I've been checking throughout the day both yesterday and today to congratulate you for your run. but never lived when i checked whomLUL
and aipom spawns ambipom
aipom chase
ambi battle
your run made the English any% runs to 50
i also amused watching it to verify it
hi cinder
hi glenn
boop firework already
im scared
dont be
last any% i spent 50 seconds looking for torchic
just be a minute faster
i dont wanna relive that
i can easily bop firework all i need is to not do password pikachu for gyarados
why are you even using passwords anyways Glenn
use to do it so brain went "do it again"
i *should* come back into speedrunning
I'll just verify things
and say hi glenn when he puts it in the description
no quick kill?
decent mankey
better than my most recent mankey kills tbh
anyways hi. I'm Cinder. the main mod for Park 1 cinder23Smile
so i heard in your vod. all friends
i approve
ooo we can race :)
i.e do it at the same time
as long as your all friends any% time beats Cheez's normal any% time. you're golden
for my sanity sake
aw man I'd love to watch a race
cheez's normal any% time is like 4hr
if it seems I'm mean to Cheez, don't worry. he's my friend and LITERALLY WANTS TO BE THE WORSE PARK RUNNER
YOOO ODDISH FREE
BACK BY BRIDGe
imagine doing h&s strats whomDerp
there's basically two spots and you could see one of them during the countdown
imagine having a good time in this game gcjLUL
that headbutt of frustration pieBaited
peepoSad missing spearow jump
Pachirisu noooooo
i feel like the game would be rude to me for not playing it in so long
i'd recommend still going for golduck for the sake of gyarados attraction
pokepark was kind to me after i took a break
for all friends it was like 3 minutes or somethin
park was kind to me in a race with furi and rob when livesplit crashed and mid run i was editing whoms pokemon counter thing for Series race
and that was the last time
i might do park bingo soon cause bingo funny
also i spent like 2 hours making bingo layouts
I'm off to bed. i expect a run to verify with all of Mantis' tomorrow's gcjHi
goals are okay tbh cause they are split between attraction/friend making decently well
i shall
bye bye cinder

Froslass is gonna leave him for you PokPikachu
first mawile now this
torterra is one of the easiest fights but yall aint ready for that conversation
oH yeAH TorTERra iS eASy, juSt PusH hIM iNTO thA WaTER
not having that convo
Mamoswine wtf man WutFace "it's okay that he attempted to murder me, or at the very least imprison me in ice forever, we just have different viewpoints"
who do you think you are, bradyboo, world record holder of park 1
i still love that vid when legends was announced, where they edited the trainer over the torterra fight
okay glennjamin, 14th place holder of mario 3d world
not even my greatest achievment, you mean, glennjaamin, world record holder of every pokepark gyarado IL
who do you think you are, uhhhh idk woo #
Are you doing max dash or double dash route?
11 obv
what comes out of bonslys eyes
rainbows, of course
meowth is the poor man's backup to torchic
we dont talk about torchic
this is a funny game to listen to
you just hear random pokmon names
i love the cries in this game
tbolt her for consistency shift3
froslass just bullied glalie we caught it in 4k
now hes gotta do the crate strat to save 0.002 seconds :0
the glenn strat
actually if you pick up a crate and shove yourself into the corner you can clip into the next zone
cant wait for the summoning salt video where he talks about the glenn strat
the game was dry with runs forever until one day a discovery was found dubbed "the glenn"
if i had a nickel for every person ive convinced to play park, i would have 2 nickels
which isnt much but still surprising
brady look at what you've made him do
fricken item sliding
mf did it on the wrong side
its the only place that actually might save time
hardest thing in the game and all you do is just run against a wall ResidentSleeper
this man making the loop
i love the raichu cry. who did that with their mouth
losing half a second not picking gible smh
it's only like that cause you dont care about the bonus
if you want third stage dash get bonus with gible cause its 5k
theres like 4 options for this attraction, gible saves the most time and raichu is the easiest and most lenient
DUGTRIO NOOO
NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
just get magby
dugtrio is in the route wtf
LMAO BRADY
how have you been completing runs
Dugtrio is free as hell he's just a talk
when is eevee version?
it is i just checked lol
you know... the better version
getting gaslighted in my route
this game looks cringe
if you are following the route but skipping dugtrio im confused on how you can get past rotom without being roadblocked
he got an extra in meadow since he went ambi/aipom as well
Ohhhh ok
he should be way over atm tbh
what can Pikachu do with a gold nugget
enter the drug trade
i remember when we didnt know you can just hold the run button to run through that cutscene
we used to have to mash and it was like a 2 frame window for a 1 sec time save lol
rhyperiors is a nightmare in allfriends :(
are you a sick enough dude to be friends with rhyperior
stinky attraction
you can skip the bonus in this actually
my favorite part
oh boy
lurking playing some minecraft with pokepark sfx is not expected to be relaxing
theres no timing its honestly just buffering your inputs and mashing
agreed. still not consistent at it
drifblim is saying glenn i swear
ah yes autoscrollers my favorite
all the same lmao yeah
lmao when you put it like that
Pokepark speed runs? Interesting
I didn't know it had a battle system like this
Cheer10 gg
thousands upon thousands to save 5 seconds at the end of the day
now do it again
Same lol
Jibca gets here in like 6 hours
Ooh where you going?
Combo breaker
Do a rando on the plane
Nice, have fun!
Loaf tweeted about mn smash being negatively different since 2019 and I'm glad finally someone brought it up lol
I've been talking to jibca about that for months
YO RIDDLES JOINING TEAM LIQUID
It's weird to explain but like the energy is just different, the top end is just shitters and then there's a gap for the twins and failbot and some of the TO's running shit now are just eugh
Mainly just the TO for saturday shit who is currently being ratiod absurdly hard in loafs replies LOL
But yea I'm not engaging with the twitter end of that because there's no reason to
So I just posted a mario odyssey weed mario
MORE SPLITS
DOUBLE LIVE
But yea Idk why people are that surprised about loafs tweet, it's the reason Jibca won't play ultimate for the most part
Like he has gripes with the game itself but he's said to me he mainly won't go to shit because he just doesn't care for the people anymore
He'll come with for me and jaemi tho on some occasions
Yea when I went to AS I was like "Oh I should talk to people and whatever" then I got there and realized besides lucky who do I really wanna talk to there besides hanging out with like jaemi and failbot lol
Cause plant isn't there
If brady goes I'll hangout with him tho
I didn't get to meet him that was the one week he didn't go lol
GL PHANTOM I WILL MIGRATE TO BED TO WATCH
Brady I'm likely gonna be at like every AS in june so go to those
i wasnt at todays either lol
I wanted to go today but work + ride isn't in town currently
did they halve his coin requirement
I haven't played since rando patch 1 lol
i have no idea what you look like taco so you have to be the one to find me
look at any of aurawolfs sets from last AS besides the lucky one and I'm right behind him
Also this seed is very good
It has goombario
Bow is pretty good at hide and seek
She had a good spot
Goombario is the best tho that's why you never get him usually
The only reason :)
Surely you would never find him and leave
He's just a good hider
But yea I've felt a similar thing to the st cloud people for like months too lol
Like I pretty much just go to hangout with the TO, Shrumble, and Jaemi
Old ass
everyone is so weird at locals
what do i expect though its a local LOL
MN locals are very interesting crowds
But yea at st cloud shit I'll play Wario for Jaemi obv and then I'll play it for the people I know genuinely want to improve and want the exp
But for the shitters I will just go falco
hes going to go falco vs me NotLikeThis
The more I play falco the more I think fuck that character
He has too much shit
Thank god jaemi can't do the IDJ loops LOL
I mash that shit and get 60 for free into kill situation
the 2 things my falco does that jaemi can't
I can dragdown fair off neutral win
And I can IDJ combo
im just an 0-2 but i keep up with everyone in friendlies just fine and win decent amount of them so im fine :)
But then he's just better everywhere else lol
Fuck falco
@Bradybooo I'm playing seph now so I can tell you shit
My seph already going positive in game count in friendlies with aurawolf
Footstool dair is so fucking good for falco murdering
seph wins the matchup tho
They did once
Because lucky isn't my r3 anymore
lemme check again
Seph def wins but like
If I'm not doing good shit I will get falco'd very hard against him
Was very funny at AS last week because Failbot let Jaemi pick yoshis because Failbot mained mario before steve
you have to spam alot of fair in the matchup
And now he perma bans it lol
AS stagelist is some ass tho
Isn't it just everything besides NC
Cause that list is good lol
dont need 3 triplats bro :(
Yea that's a good stage list
It's everything besides HB and NC
and then theres town and kalos and fd
This is just a good stagelist with 3 bans lol
replace kalos and lylat and we chilling
Aight so you're one of those
Starters: Battlefield, Final Destination, Pokemon Stadium 2, Smashville, Town & City Counterpicks: Small Battlefield, Kalos, Lylat Cruise, Yoshi's Story
it does
That's why it's good
it used to have 2 bans like a month ago
It's just the st cloud ruleset besides the fact that it's 3 ban instead of mdsr
2 bans with that stagelist is a nightmare though. 3 is aight
I just need 1 ban for fd
then I'm chillin
FD ain't even bad for me I just don't like it
i played friendlies with jackypoo for my first time at the local for an hour and then i got the dude r1 in bracket
Ezekiel3 YO A THIRD ONE
how shitty is that
They made aurawolf my r3 despite us playing every month in st cloud and also me putting a note on the reg to not do that lol
Like besides failbot I'm the one who would beat jaemi in that venue but I don't wanna do that early lol
Cause MN has no defensive players besides failbot, Jaemi runs his offense to hell and back on people
you say that but half of our region plays steve and samus
and then theres the megamans that carried over from s4
im super sadge about it too theres so many steves and i havent fought one yet. like its a super good matchup for Seph I actually WANT to fight steve
Mirai is a masher so them playing steve doesn't count for that
I've played a buncha friendlies with failbot tho he's a bitch
Cool ass dude but fuck playing him LOL
My bracket hasn't changed since this week lemme name search you
Yep the same
Jaaahsh is in your pool after that lol
Beat his ass
He plays bayo right
thas free
Haus is cool af
get along with him very well at AS and he doesnt play like a bitch its nice
Keep in mind ikan has a powerful mind, he doesn't have a twitter so he is at full mental capacity
they will flood the stage so you can pushed up
you get
What if they put me in jesse's pool and I won
Also AK didn't go to this for some reason
Kinda wanted to beat his ass in bracket
One of my fgc to's is in jesse's pool lol
Proc might have to play DaddyDan r2, they're probably not good but if he loses to Daddy fucking Dan I'm not letting him live it down
im going to bed gn all
The tag is just really good lol
I'm very surprised I'm seeded to leave my pool
I have a top 60 seed somehow
I'm seeded to lose to #2 in chicago and get to top 96 that way
YO TOP NASB CONTENT!?!?!?
You're fucked
He's gonna turn off the voices and start moving
Ok just saw some dude on twitter reply to someone draw genshin protag as black and got offended over it and their pinned tweet was some shit about twitter likes not mattering so I checked there's
And it's anime feet bot posts
what even is the internet
YEA THEIR LAST LIKE
IS FROM "FeetHentaiBot"
jesus fucking christ the likes are all cosplay onlyfans and crinkly foot hentai
That's enough twitter for now I'm going to lab smash for a bit
Do it again
but did you do funny jump
maybe I should look at the screen huh
my b
You get a Drake
If I manage to get top 24 winners I play ned
I'd have to beat steve to do that....
Path before is #2 in IL who plays lucina, I've played before and it went ok
Into lucky which I can very much win
Set with lucky at AS was 2 last hit games that went absurdly close to time lol
I also SD'd game 2
At 20
But it was kalos so after I hit the waft I was big fucking chillin on the plats
Also was demonstrated where his defense lacks because he played jaemi right after
And got shit on LOL
It's so fun watching people play him for the first time
People aren't used to not being allowed to play without having good defensive play
And then Falco hits you twice
Yea me and Jaemi play the exact same with eachother in wifi sessions and there's so many spots where we're mutually like "Yea he hit that offline" so it makes it way easier to mentally play long sessions with him online lol
Ah yes the pinnacle of good option = always good and not looking at why people use the option in a scenario
option = good option*
Why would you ever BW outside of combo without techchase or projectile read
Also wanted to update my mods because I haven't for a bit and had things to add
And realized pc doesn't have an sd slot lol
Yea I wish I wasn't lazy about updating mods and did it sooner
Cause i wanted to add more music before cb lol
I want that new geese theme
Why do my weed mario tweets do better than my clips
I have a weed mario folder now
It has 6 whole unique weed marios
Honestly I'm feeling kinda confident I could place my seed
This bracket isn't too bad honestly
Maister won coinbox after DQ'ing r1 for a covid test lol
what game is this?? hmm well judging from the graphics and the obvious age of the relic I would have to say It would be GARBAGE.. GARBAGE FROM KING GARBAGE FROM THE GARBAGE DYNASTY lol
he won 19 sets in a row on wifi
hahah how are u dude
how long is the flight
u going to combo breaker.. bruuh.. u didn't u say something we could've room and stuff lol
and I would've gone
still would've paid for my share lol
buy the soda
it's refreshing
anyway good luck ok
I'm bringing the ps4 to the airbnb so we can fuck around with kof
I haven't played since launch lol
I just kinda bought it to support the game cause I had extra money and it looked fun but then the matchmaking was ass and no friends had it lol
They still haven't fixed matchmaking but the lobbies are good
Tempted to buy marvel 3 to fuck around too since none of us actually play it it'd be fun
there will be no vergil or morrigan fuckery
I played it a tiny bit with 74 because he bought it for me and it was fun
We just fucked around and didn't lab combos so it was just flailing and it was great
Wdym you don't have a spare dreamcast + crt to fly with lol
I found the original render that was given weed and I can't look at mario the same
could you lzs from that top entry wall onto that table for the item
like if you scew it right
didn't lzs from the clock to that table smh
yea but you lose coolness factor
People are streaming morbius on the artifact category LOL
I DONT KNOW
BUT IT'S MORBIN TIME
I'm putting this up on the other monitor
it's 10 minutes in
aw hell yea they got subtitles too
Jesse is watching it rn too with bear from a separate vod LMAO
The chat is just only saying it's morbin time
holy shit what is this camera work
They just had the slowest fucking shaky cam running scene
and nobody was chasing him LOL
a snack for later
I'm hungry, you don't wanna see me when I'm hungry, he's about to morb I think
he's morbing
CHANNEL GOT BANNED NOOOO
I'm so sad now
I wanted to do a little morbing
i am trying to hook up a wiimote to my computer and having problems
can we watch morbius tomorrow
yeah connecting it is easy it is getting it to do anything that is hard
It wasn't interesting or good from the first 30 minutes but I also want to morb
if you are using dolphin than they have it set up so you can use it easily
but i am trying to use it on stuff that is isn't wii games
Someone is watching revenge of the sith in artifact category lol
so it is hard
That's what it's always been wdym
It's always been hentai and free movies LOL
There is nobody playing this game there's currently streams for Dune, Spongebob, and King of the Hill
was it ever alive
what robotics club were you in in high school?
yeah I am doing that right now
my team is going to egypt over the summer
yeah they have districts now in addition to regionals now
5HSNK 6OI!!!
ermm ... thank you
I need this escape rn
@Axl_Sensei Drake
well we still had to drive 2.5 hours to portland for one of our district events so
my shift is looking like 5 or 6 am send halp!
i don't live as far north as Seattle so
I'll be in bed around 8am
I wish that seed in the cave was a trap lmao
so was doesn't annoy me as much as when people think that washington state doesn't exist and just think that Washington dc is the only one
you coming to orlando?
chicago has buff00n so it's worse
one day we'll do the phantom_axl meet up
when I get there it will be better tho
also I have a clip for you
but not now, I'm on mobile
yes, it's worth sharing again LUL
(New game)!
fucking hate new game
Well I'm not a weeb and didn't know that existed sooo
so tell us, what's it like to miss a 25 six times KEKW
typo, I'm blaming auto correct
Maybe it's good I never made you play windwaker you'd still be doing pg skip
so tonight being thurs
if I'm not too tired I'll try rando again
finish and raid me I'm gonna stream while I practice/lab
I'm looking at 45 hours in 4 days
I was gonna a while ago but then there was morbing and I also wanted to watch this seed
no raid Me! I'll be live in 16 hours
He has a good point do that
train station?
my brother offered me a job doing data entry, very considering it
he runs an insulation company
what game are you making
it starts a tadpole
is this a passion project?
don't forget to include a rando mode
why do you think pape rando is so successful?
making video games is hard i am trying to make a board game though
yeah i have like almost everything done for the board game it is just kinda broken in how it plays
is that good?
so it needs to be tweaked
BEST WAIFU
sending that image to komari and dalus
so when bn6 buster only?
did you change your mind yet?
falzar buster only you heard it chat!
time to go back
my bombette mashing is bad
have a safe flight
ok have successfully packed clothes a whole 3 hours before leaving
went to the restroom and randomly remembered I didn't do that lol
I literally only have jeans and most my shirts look the same so it wouldn't have mattered I can do it in 5 minutes LOL
YO THERE'S A NEW MORBIUS ACCOUNT
I CAN WATCH
THE THIRD MORBIUS247
aw hell yea he's already morbing
i don't get how the yoshi's get home after you save them like do they swim through the water or something
this opening sequence is just alien but morbed
couldn't you havealso just mega quaked everyone
Wanna become famous? Buy viewers, followers and primes on yourfollowz. com
no fuck you
it would be a neat touch that if a shyguy is holding slow go the shy guy moved super slow
and if speedy spin it moves super fast
but no one plays without always speedy spin so that would never happen
whens the always slow go setting
just go faster
have you thought about adding a out of logic option to the tracker?
he's morbing again
only 25 minutes of shit that didn't matter but he's doing it again
wouldn't it be better the upgrade fp once than to the thing where your fp+hp go down that way you get even more bp
what is the condition for the crash?
oh i have just never encounterd the crash
my switch won't turn on uh oh
It booted cfw weirdly and loaded home but then it turned off
oh ok we good
Removed SD and waiting a while holding the power button got a vanilla boot
you know why I will never encounter a problem with my switch
because i don't have one
If they release a switch pro I am 100% just going to full homebrew this one and get that
the switch that I want is one that i can get for free
i have a feeling Nintendo isn't ever going to come out with the switch that I want though
Hai hai.
As usual.
How were the badge BP costs in this seed?
wait you can damage hallway through the star sheild
Oh my god.
What the ****.
oh thought it was like final where he has 99 def
is there only two enemies in the game with 99 def
the chat is back to morbing after a brief break to spam "Have sex" for one specific scene
This movie is boring as shit so far LMAO
It's literally only entertaining because of the morbposting
raid morbius_247
Just raid yourself.
And then stream more.
how long till you leave for the flight
Have fun with that, by the way.
you wanna vc after you get ready
Cause I got 2 and a half hours to burn lol
and froslass kinda sus
I feel that ...
uhm ... people usually tell me "give yourself small goals so you can enjoy it all the way" or something of the sort
not like I know how to do that lol
basically so you can feel that "yay I did something!" all the way
yo gl phantom
pb'ing is like a gift tbh, i never expect it
so uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
that new pkmn professor speaks my language
I've not seen anything about the game, but the lady definitely speaks to B
I don't know but I really liked the peach segments in this game the one time I played it... though I got the cake wrong so many times lol
the timing bit always screwed me as a kid
tell me
kid b SUCKED at video games
what a jerk
Good luck!
I'd propose a "RESET" command for channel points, but that sounds godawful on paper
no pun intended
Heyo glgl
That's so fair
Tyty, played not like garbage and made a baller call for checks.
It won't happen again.
Hai hai.
I'm alright. You?
I'd hope I know it with the amount I watch
I'm farming up a Magnamalo in Monster Hunter Rise (think very spicy cat). It refuses to drop its' 3% chance gem.
I need one more gem for one last Handicraft deco. >:I
I'm 82 Magnamalos deep at this point.
Fair. My Sword and Shield needs the Handicraft deco to just barely get into a sliver of white sharpness, and then I'm using the decos that give me 90 seconds of unlimited sharpness after sharpening.
The Daora Switchaxe can get white sharpness pretty easily with like, one handicraft.
I'm a bowgunner. I don't see a problem with Daora. Haha.
I'm terrified of the Valstrax. Not because I die to the ambush ( I don't), but, I'm terrified of it because public lobbies die to it repeatedly.
mh rise? pumped for sunbreak
will need to shake off some rust soon
I'm HR 247 at this point. Def getting Sunbreak.
feel like i've had launches like that. sometimes your heart just isnt in it
I think that I've just barely surpassed my MH Gen HR at this point. And I need to get to like.. 380 to surpass my MH4U HR.
i think I'm actually around 380 in rise
I went through 3U with nothing but a Heavy Bowgun.
i loved 4u
Online didn't exist yet, but I did all of the 3U online stuff solo. With a HBG.
i can understand that
My dainty hands are perfect for the 3DS.
sucks. ive felt that way about my switch, but i bought a grip that helps
Anyways. For the S&S set, I'm remaking my old Teostra S&S set, as it had some redundancies, and wasn't really a mixed set yet, not truly.
i prefer docked mode for sure, just like the option
It now consists of: Blast Attack III, Protective Polish III, Evade Extender III, Speed Sharpening III, Critical Eye II (not super relevant, incidental), Handicraft 3 because the Teostra S&S just barely gets a sliver of white sharpness from III, Teostra Blessing II, Crit Boost I (incidental), Fortify I.
So, blast attacks. Normally you get like.. one blast off every.. Minute or so? I get 1-3 blasts off per S&S combo.
Well yeah, hence why I said that.
1-3 blasts per combo is insane.
By giving actually decent weapons that have status on them.
Instead of like.. 130 power dual blades.
Do you mind if I spout builds at you? I like sharing this stuff.
Like, I'd like to share my LBG build, but don't want to keep throwing numbers at you.
I have min-maxed my Zinogre LBG to that absolute maximum that it can be. Literal perfect Talisman and everything.
Bow S-tier and so fun
Spare Shot III, Normal/Rapid Up III, Ammo Up III, Reload Speed III, Recoil Down III, Rapid Fire Up III, Evade Extender III, Counterstrike II.
Yea for real HR 380 and i dont have a single 'god' talisman
I can easily swap Evade for Ballistics if I want, but typically don't.
Love my zooms.
And my nyooms.
Welcome back Phantom
Rapid Morph.
Daora Switchaxe: Protective Polish III, Focus III, Speed Sharpening III, Wirebug Whisperer III, Rapid Morph III, Power Prolonger II, Constitution II, Evade Extender II, Crit Eye I, Dragon Attack I (redundant, incidental), Handicraft I, Marathon Runner I, Stamina Surge I.
Yeah it is. Haha.
I have so much fun with the mix sets in Rise. They're so good compared to older games.
Building a new set is my favorite type of puzzle.
I can't remember if I've previously mentioned that in like, 4U, I farmed just over 8,000 Black Gravios to get a single gosh darn Black Gravios heart.
key be like: HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream
Yes it is.
I had max zenny several hundreds of times over.
From all those parts.
Here goes Magnamalo 83. Wish me luck!
The desire sensor in MH games for me is real.
It's so unforgiving.
It's real for me, all of the time.
The second I get one gem, it'll drop four of them.
hehe i got 6.9 k points :3
and now it went up to 7k -_-
No gem. Two plates though. >:I
you planing of doing a rando if the run dies?
stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence
Do you wanna know how many plated I have?
best character
Seventy freaking six.
Oh I plan to.
Or, or it could not die
anything can happend
green station can't wa-
Very clean #84. No gem.
This video game is going to give me that which I desire. >:I
Oh god. I ran out of Normal 2's in my box, from fighting this thing.
I keep about 10k stocked at all times.
Yes, Meine Fuhrur.
Bad joke? :(
I'm German. I couldn't help myself.
I spelled Fuhrer wrong.
I blame Magnamalo.
So, wanna know where all my luck goes to?
Spare Shot for the LBG.
It has a 20% chance of activating with Spare Shot III.
It feels like it activates 80% of the time.
That's where my luck goes.
I'm not complaining, but like, that's where ALL of my luck goes.
My record is 31 Spare Shot procs in a row.
#85 complete. No gem.
It really does not. I'm used to this.
We press on! #86.
#86 done. No luck.
Can we hit 100? ;_;
I mean, I might as well at this point.
It's fine. it's adding up the LBG hunts on my Guild Card.
did you get the jam?
don't forget it
go fast
thats what they all say
so 3dw 2p on saturday?
even more pog
We love successful coin flips
Hahahaha. Oh my god. So, I'm fighting #87 and I accidentally hit a Jaggi with two slicing shots. The Magnamalo then hit it with a tail uppercut. The Magnamalo SENT THAT JAGGI TO THE SHADOW REALM. I know this, because I could see the slicing shot numbers going off about.. oh... 6,000 miles under the world.
someone else actually reached out to me about doing 2p runs that wasnt in our immediate freind group
Also, no gem.
Nice gold.
aggro ass bee
i bee with you hehe
When you're under less pressure from Paper Mario, please do read my above message when you have a chance.
I'm dying of laughter.
its melvin, that eu guy that crushed the 2p boards earlier
No worries. I understand that you're a wee bit focused.
he asked as if he needed any credentials for it and stated his any% time which is jokes cause i know that man is goated at 2p
Like, I knew that the small monsters can get sent to the Shadow Realm, but, I didn't expect it to be down that far.
the funny thing is i would do the same thing cause im awkward af for collabs
im down to race ya in park any% after if ya want
I think that I'm gonna take a break after #88. My head is starting to hurt.
yeah im rusty af in any% i completely forgot you can save and quit in lava zone until i saw brady do it in the bingo race
good keep saving time and such
parakarry had some trouble
#88 done. No gem. Break time.
I have so many Friend Vouchers now.
All of the Talisman farming.
I'm gonna finagle a snack together.
I should hope so.
bruh, Bowser has the Star Rod
he could've fixed that window a long time ago
There's a hall there?
yeah, cuz there's probably still glass on the floor
if he ain't wished the window fixed, he sure as heck ain't vacuumed
Cinnamon bun. :D
Oh, it is pretty good right now.
I try to eat healthy, but, I feel like I've earned this. LuL
Add a small bit of chicken for something extra?
Hmm.. Maybe I'll make a salad for dinner tomorrow too. The idea is sounding better and better by the minute.
spinach > lettuce
I'm not a fan of spinach, but I LOVE Brussels Sprouts.
I use spinach in place of lettuce
I totally agree.
spinach cooked into the yolk of an omelet
You ever just bonk actual Kooper there because he pissed you off that day?
Kooper isn't Goombario
Phantom would 1000000000000% whack Goombario
Bombette down there like Charmander in the early Pokemon episode where its' trainer didn't want it, like.. "He's coming back, right?"
Welp. Now that I've had my snacco, I'm gonna go punish myself by playing DBD.
Good luck with the rest of the run!
i don't get it why bowser have more clown carts?

NI NO KUNI?
do we really need to kill zelda if they're just botw posting now
give me more top down games if you're not going to do anything close to TP's quality for the 3d ones please
The remake for LA was really good but the base game was just mid
why was there naked people for 2 seconds
FF16 looks epic
thats it
I'm ngl I don't really care for the current final fantasy combat style
It just feels too damage spongey to make anything really satisfying
good to have you back, I popped in yesterday but mobile data was shit
Berseria felt really good to me, just had to position my people well and my big hits usually actually did damage to health bars
click bait tweet lmao
playstation 4 is gonna be rad
it's been out for so long and yet nobody has one still
did you get your day 1?
i played miles, GT7, and Kena
you would had to wait to play miles on ps4
elden ring is the only open world game i've ever enjoyed
do you know how the lzs trainer works in new fp?
botw can suck my re-hashed 3 mechanics dick
too many streams I wanna watch rn >_<
komari starting exe4
me right now
one of my friends was streaming pape rando today but he was using the other tracker. Was first time I saw someone not use yours. I like how small everything was leaving more space in the overlay, but yours is just so much cleaner.
yeah, was just my gut reaction
what was your highlight for combo breaker
yo glgl
i cant wait to work every day for the rest of my life :)
it's been chill at least tho
i have a 45 min commute each way until i move into a new place in early july where it'll be 5 mins instead
so it'll be nice to have another 1.5 hours back in my day
that sounds lit
there is always bn6 buster only KEKW
fat run
the last letter?
or the first?
ah okay
that one sucks ass
yeah having saves makes practice so easy
youve almost caught up to mitzi shes getting portrait now
timers are 7 minutes off, this race is intense
its a race to me
you just gave her a handicap
yeah sp[lit after peach
I meme about it
why cant we all just have the same splits Sadge
"strimer u forgotz 2 splitz agin"
Hai hai.
monday I wanted to do rando but didnt have time so I made a seed for next time so I can just go lol
I see green.
oh also, mark and I are doing rando race tues, wanna join?
we havent picked a time yet
normally I work on sundays so need to find other times for races lol
how does it learn?
damn she just go tthe key
you so close
yeah before I do my first run I want to look over intermidiate route and see if theyre anything i wanna go for
what about bombette in the pit?
i might be confusing routes then
i do remember seeing routes where they use her in the pit
nmb that mustve been it
bro, im no fake gamer
eating mushroom is the best 7 seconds you can spend in a first few runs
oh i just rmemebed
dont I need a windows 98 for that?
i remember having a windows 95 as a kid
then 98 was a huge deal
I hate lantern ghost
he gave me goombario once
so what is the strat using watt on lantern?
I failed 3 power shocks in a row!!!
like turn 1 powerr shock?
oh no she reset
she was in toy box but wasnt paying close attention
she threw lantern KEKW
i get that too
ezekiel is a good dog
shared a jade jungle remix you need to hear in #music
tonight im gonna look at the file that came on my jpn cart
yeah, risch did that once with exe6, they traded all the recovs so he couldnt beat gregar LMAO
cool thing about bn is its not just folder build but navicust too
is it faster take stairs or hit lava at the end there
sometimes i get an error when I boot my everdrive, I just reset til it works
I got it with a loaded card so have been using that
How long have you been running PM?
I've been looking into learning TTYD glitchless, but I enjoy watching runs of both games.
ttyd gless is a fucked up run
but i enjoy it a lot
i'd enjoy it more if it didn't take 6.5 hours
Exactly. I'd want to take a few weeks to learn the routing well before going for runs in TTYD
i do a run every few weeks just to keep fresh, but it requires too much time to do more often
theyre fine yeah
they're a little clunky, but they work well
power bounce in TTYD is weird always imo. this game feels better
if you're gonna do a gless run let me know, theres a route change you should 1,000% do
I felt that with power bounce when moving to PM after playing TTYD a lot
What do you enjoy more at the moment?Speedruns or Randomizer for PM?
I found your stream through your randomizer runs on YouTube.
Yep, I get that lol
The first game I tried to learn to speedrun was Sunshine the cutscenes and everything at the start was too long for me lol
I enjoyed my casual play throughs of it, it's a really fun game
My wife who never plays video games even played through it with me
I gotta head to bed since I get up early for work (I'm on EST). I'll probably watch the replay of the vod tomorrow though. Keep up the good pace!
getting pretty tired, plan is nap for 2 hours then stream but well see how that goes lol
thanks for the stream
good luck
yo gl
thicc door 1
yeahm unblock claw, charge, switch to bow, bounce/outta sight > bounce

parakarry fight is a scam
yeah if you have super watt it helps
turbo charge clutch
did you just eat the life shroom
unblocked fire does 9 iirc
gg man
that was a sick run
blame the bad run on the Malort's
better than apple cider vinegar
this is rando, mate
no prologue around these parts
all my homies hate prologue
call the file Malort's
you should be able to sell badges in rando
more coins based on their BP
A fuzzy threw it in the ? Block cuz it knows Kooper lacks hops
HECK YEAH, DUDE
that's gross
Mario HATES Repel Gels
he's a diva who wants EVERYONE to see him
wanna say yeah, it was Koopa Village
professional dodger
*one slap* bitch
gl gamer
I heard from Axl that you're doing BN4 after this run
yeah same, I had a good pace run for the first 30m in my last run
like insane pace actually
but then the next 3 splits were trash
both bad RNG and some misplays on my end
Simply eat bowser
reverse bowsers inside story
tomorrow's the last chance for BN4 COPIUM
yeah switching to 5 because I got bopped there
NGO Pog
BN5 is chill, has every possible RNG in BN basically
It's gonna be 10 fp
@buff00n I'm subbed so I outrank you so you shush

he speaks
y'know goombario would be able to help knock them down

I need him to start morbing again
morph could never
MegaDie? I've heard of that band.
I don't even listen to heavy shit I listen to symphonic and power lol
Watching pokemon runs and thinking, "why is pignite's cry a wet fart?"

I met iwata before
he was a good man
we played each other in Mario kart
I was up till 5 cause stomach issues then called out of work because I had to be there at 9 and like I didn't want to at that point
man I still miss him
We already had people there so I don't feel too bad about it I was just there to help with a load
the toad is telling you secrets
Burger king is doing gay burgers now

I had the perfect response to Taco's tweet
I was about to tell you that reply was really good LOL
Plant RT'd it now all of minnesota will see double weed

I was originally going to send Taco a different response

how tf you speeding a draft
I'm going to card war
you're a grown ass man, read the card text.

Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
I think that was the fastest I've reacted to one of those LOL
also "mountviewers . com" Flushed
didn't even get a chance to buy any aceari4NormanSadge
no space between . and com
this is a family friendly stream no mounting viewers
now if only they could send weed Mario
from sending weed mario?
Looked at strive mods to see if they had any good millia colors and every mod is just horny
I just want a good purple one I don't need to see barefoot millia mods
I don't think the slight modification worked
How is there nothing but purple for smash mods but I can't find a single good purple mod for strive
oop there's the nude mods
why are these here
where's the nude Wario mod?
the cowards haven't given me that power yet
Ok found 1 good mod that's just one of her reds from xrd that looks nice
WHY IS THERE LIKE 5 VARIANTS OF THE NUDE MOD
I KEEP SCROLLING AND MORE SHOW UP
we were looking through mods and found a comment on one of them and they asked where Nude Wario was and it got liked and upvoted
ok I found a good purple fucking finally
At the bottom of the page someone made an alt that's of my unist character
ooo they made ones for all of eltnums alts too
evo tweet is interesting
"Evo is grateful to share that we have been working with Sony PlayStation, Epic Games, and our developer partners to reduce input latency for many of your favorite fighting games! Please expect more updates to follow as Evo works towards a more responsive future for the FGC."

he followed you from combo breaker
what comes out of state so i found you here on twitch :D
mx_four: what comes out of state so i found you here on twitch :D
your bot has done a lot of ezekiel roleplay
EzekielHD : You have allowed Ezekiel2 to twist your mind, until now... until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy. Ezekiel : Don't lecture me, EzekielHD ! I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear Ezekiel2 as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire. EzekielHD : Your new empire?

bombette misses the ch7 switch if she is on top of it
it is very funny
i mean literally on top
i did that a few weeks ago lmfao
i hope your chat is more helpful than mine
who the fuck voted against me
i chose to be helpful (this time)
look at that sceptile
i've lurked a bit
that's what I bought jesse last year
but i do not know what the fuck is going on
Pikachu is making friends and kicking ass
45x better than arceus
i did NOT have fun
i defended it when it came out but god it's not fun lmao
45 minutes of text mashing and i wanted to quit
that voice for mew is awful i'm offended
let's go is so good
Oh yea I got to play brady on wednesday
ive heard of this game but never seen it before
We only played a few games, the first one was close then I 3 stocked him a couple times lol
He's solid but he didn't have an answer for when I had answers to him
no but I assume it's frowned upon by god
hey dont call me out like that
it's shameful whether or not this other guy exists
are glitchless attempts shameful or painful
Ok I went through all that to get my purple millia but I've ended up liking this red and white one the most anyways lol
It's just the same colors as my Titania alt for ike in ult
dark red and white kinda just works for me
I'll send you a pic of the alt
When talking to jibca about fe9 and 10 he said "You can't tell me that Titania isn't the most perfect woman to come out of FE"
the bot is being abused in komaris stream
that was accurate footage of me buying my giant plush at combo breaker
at this point in paper mario we are talking to goompa
I've been told sf6 is gonna have macros for command inputs and I don't think there's been any shown drawbacks to using them yet so that's a bit wack
But those are needed to balance move accessing it's just going to be worse to have them on
Ok that's a bad drawback LOL
Hai hai. : D
oddish might have the most stereotypical high pitched asian woman voice ive ever heard
I did. On #91. But as we discussed, naturally, not only did I get one gem, but I got two from #91. Naturally.
croagunk is like a 15 year old who's been downing 2 packs a day since he was 5
he is also frogkin
I told you. It always works that way.
What is your least favorite section of this game and why is it the Mew jump?
this was a pathetic showing
that mf won worlds
But yeah, I finished my Teostra S&S set off of that Magnamalo gem. I also made a Bazelguise Dual Blade set by changing a couple things out for Marathon Runner and I then got an insanely good Talisman. Evade Extender III + Counterstrike I + a 3 slot deco slot.
God tier Talisman. : D
OBSTACLE HOP MY BELOVED
YO HE GOT HOPS
I'm still waiting for the obstacle hop.
I didn't see any obstacles, nor any hopping.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wish I had optimal friends
I just have buff00n
he loses me a lot of time with his late ass
y'know I can't call him dumbass now without thinking of that carride and what jesse said
the clowncar was a curse
I did not go into combo breaker thinking we couldn't fit in a car because buff00n had a dumpy
ok i don't miss that part of smash
yea so m4 that whole weekend we had buff00n driving and 4 of us in the back and it was ok
Then 1 ride we let proc drive instead and we genuinely couldn't fit in the back anymore
Buff00n isn't even large he's a very average sized person
he just has a dumpy
I always think that's a partner badge at first glance
yes im partner now
the first streamless partner
Technically that was jesse
Cause he never streamed without partner
Panda just said here you go
woah is this the secret Paper Mario 64 chapter?
Did you play through the new Pokemon Snap, by chance?
while I was in the back, TacoGuyy STAYED slamming into me every chance he got
Oh, yeah. I felt that too.
"Just took a dump on the run so I'm excited to see how that goes lol "
"you are now friends" -bashes them into the water-
are you REALLY friends if you DON'T make them eat shit every now and then???
taking you to child hell
you know about drifloon picking up children right?
I tried to time 'em out, but Taco was too quick on the draw
He was playing splattytoon
Love live game LMFAO
There is 1 on the ps4
is there one that isn't a gacha
ain't playing no love live game
That has $150 plus worth of dlc
your setting a bad example for the bidoof
Grandma wants to fight
why do no gios like to block
I'm just doing fake shit and they keep getting counterhit
Taco race me and Phantom in Park tm
I work the weekend
Gio has an anti-air dp
It's a 6p but big
feraligatr holdin ya back
ok I guess ky dp sucks
I misinputed an airdash and I just went through it entirely LOL
more like bitch zone
the first hit of may super off counterhit 2h
I hate it here
at least let me die to the full thing
millia please eat your wheaties
now i'm playing a floor 10 leo with level 2 thousand
he's going to mash help
@TacoGuyy try turning it off and on?
when he does back turn dash
he literally just appears there
it was just gamble between grab and block overheard
I took a round though because I hit him once and he kept DPing
this dudes message says "Jack-o thigh enjoyer"
oh boy a level a billion ram
Glalie got no hoes
why are you beating his ex wife
ok that justifies it
Ezekiel3 is down NOOOOO
I love his run cycle
he just go boing
I'm looking at the sonic frontiers gameplay and why did they slowdown sonic so much
This is the game where you want to just fucking run around and they didn't want to do that
they have auto turnaround
mawile of a shoyo
regardless how Frontiers' is received critically, I'd like Sega to review what works/doesn't work when making the next Sonic game
but, this Sega. so
They literally just have to make sonic move fluid and fun and make a world that's fun to move around in
But that's too hard
How's it that literally everyone has an idea of what they want Sonic to be BESIDES Sega???
the comics are killing it
the movies have performed phenomenally
like all they had to do to make frontiers a fun game is just make sonic move fast and responsive and let him run around the mountains and shit
the Mania devs said "we wanna make a Classic Sonic game" and they did
But he's slow as fuck lol
Like the whole thing that makes the old sonic games good is how they play with momentum
You have to path things so that you can keep your momentum and they let you go fast for it
Now you just go on rails and hit a boost button sometimes
Rush series lacked momentum, but the charm was keeping your boost gauge filled as you blasted through the stage at full speed
Hell, Modern Sonic was just Rush but 3D, but Sonic refused to let it stand on its own
see: Werehog, Wisps, Classic Sonic then Classic plus the OC thing in Forces
if a Sonic game was just Modern stages from Generations the entire game, people probably would've loved it
but Sega refused to let Modern gameplay stand on its own merits
do me afavor a get a pb thanks
do me a favor and reset
hiiii dude all three bug fables plushy got funded in like 8 hours it's crazy!
I'm buying a vi one

deadMario deadMario deadMario deadMario
he couldn't handle the weed
I don't think so?
I don't remember a golem voice
Twink <- a murderer
why is he a murderer? lol
I haven't heard that one even in pm64 speedrunning back in the day
deadMario he's fucking dead
twink fuckin killed him
Twink look at this face
a cold blooded killer
why is twink giving brain damage?
you know I expected that meme to be way better :(
Any game mod that removes leggings/stockings from a character is downgrade in my eyes
Brand new WHAT Flushed
I'm going to pop that balloon
Damn this is actually kinda intense
Cuz all it takes is someone's wifi to slip up and the run is over
wait where the smash bros at .. also ub going to double down
im a throwe :)
I threw so hard
huff happened and i cri
but HEY 22:09 new gold for prologue so yay
gonna get some food brb
back with food :3 so this speedrun requires two people?
Mario's not allowed in 2P speedruns cuz he says "OH, SHIT" every time he gets the crown
this game feels like toads treasure tracker but on steroids
just gold every split and boom sub 2 hrs yeah? Kappa
I've been influenced by the influencer
toad kitty is cute
head a little mishapen but other than that CUTE
Are you having fun? : D
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
i couldnt think of what to say lol
I've awakened from my nap
something about golem operating a machine is hilarious
you wont believe what I found
my old megaman battle network 5 player guide LUL
I found mine for red/blue, emerald, and platinum
about to grab some food
i little self conscious about not adding more, but im not beating myself over it.
rando race is about to start but I skipping today, kinda exhausted rn
I was gonna do glitchless runs today but then i took a nap and ate an edible so... not happening lmao
i just did one yesterday and didnt have the drive to finish
paper mario needs swords MissedASword
leave it. it's perfect
its fine, you said youll be starting bn3 anyways KEKW
im just here to remind you I didnt forget LUL
wasnt dinglez the only one to complete a SS run?
@Axl_Sensei good stuff on commentary earlier
i just came back with food, did you forget to reset before starting?
yo! thanks buffoon. Glad you were able to catch it
My brain doesnt register prologue if I'm being completely honest
I wanna do a prologue marathon
though recently ive been trying to focus on my spin timing and lines for prologue
How many prologues can I do in 5 hours?
i am looking forward to having taquitos for dinner oh muh goodness
im running mashed potatoes, mushroom soup, and hamburger
oh that sounds good too axl
I average 11:07 goombario
sub 11 goombario soon? BLANKIES
a whole year :O that's how you know all the tech
aww damn, bn3 is the follower goal. Gonna be waiting a hot minute for that
he is doing his best
My average prologue is 22:14 papeHands
But I mean I have been running it for less than a month so I guess that aint too bad LUL
im confused. I have a prologue split at 21.28... that cant be right
maybe I split at the summit?
Axl the prologue god ayo?
no switch is trash
you said 2209 LUL
I said 2209 about me
he def said 22:03
least likely? okay Mr. Seventh Try Speedy
axl really has it out for you tonight LUL
trying to will all sorts of bad rng into existence for you
truer words never spoken
good rng x2 to balance it out
its expensive to wish ill on the run
I have an arm chair behind me and Hikari is so cozy sleeping in it rn
is mario tripping in a fight rng?
dont thunderbolt the bullet bill KEKW
i forgot black was an original color lol
holy that chapter 1
gonna lay down with the stream, whether I fall asleep will remain to be seen
i woke up at 6am, thats not normal for me
normally I got to bed at 6am LUL
that means carpet clean %
ive done a run once, they did a showcase for bn 20th annivesary, and now today
i have no idea
terra asked me to commentate
I just ignored it
no one has any interest
i just did it as a proof of concept
i did it on english actually was a while bad
i finished a run, shared my splits "hey guys I did the thing"
"axl, we made a board so go ahead and submit it" i did it out of obligation
i feel so uncomfortable about that board
they always say "1 run is a challenge run,2 is a race, and 3 is a board"
also it was mostly blind with SS route
its cringe to watch too
if you saw the license fights
B license has magnet and ice panels
A license has lava and poison panels
so it is legit harder
but after A license the rest is cake
ice fights dont even change
all otherr script encounters change
like the triple beetank you saw komari one shot with dash
the becomes 2 beetank with howitzer int eh front row
dash goes thru howitzer so the beetanks are free
also null and void is easier cause no null and void
could you imagine 3 null and void with 330 HP with how they regin
honestly the hardest fight is mole
give you the pop up chip
in vanilla they have 10 HP and can only dmg them 1 HP per hit
in hard mode they have 15 HP
so have to use whirlpool or darkhole
they were going for the whack-a-mole gimmick
also when messing with the incomplete bn2 rando I got pop up on the tutorial, if one runs you have to do the fight over.
the 2ndround took me 45 minutes to complete OMEGALUL
if you get a script encounter and they run its free
if its in a gauntlet you have to start overr
i enjoyed the bn2 rando cause I know the game so well, but that only lasted for so long
i really liked the unique folder builds, like once I had a kunai folder. Super cool cause its more of a late game chip you never see.
bn2 was basically shuffle everything... bn3 on the other hand even changes dmg values
like ive seen a 20dmg varsword LMAO
they even change the name of the chips and navi/virus names. Seen an alphabug called KEKW
been thinking about how I want to do my splits
leaning toward enter fortress/runis/castle ect.
my old splits have some 3 minute splits and I hate that
yeah, I want to drop "prison break" too
yeah, my airman split is really short around 3 minutes but thats cause of doghouse.
if not for that it would be one split
you saw komari suffer in doghouse?
today was rough first fishy was like 4th encounter, I think 6 encounters to finish?
we took a break before starting mother comp, I told komari to run to doghouse and grind for dash * LUL
also hard mode started late cause runner overslept
you just 5 cap?
when isnt that in beginner route?
i guess 4 and 3 is easier
oh was wondering about a mid split for chapter4, gourmet guy fills that nicely
i think id split on last audio cue of him eating cake
ive seen some swap to bow in yellow house, dont know whats faster
i know jcog's old video guide said swap in the forest
im not the kinda guy to practice room but I might change my mind
but all the green
that same thing happened to me in last rando
i really need to learn LP blocks
i hear its impossible on switch
you carry the peril here from jr right?
oh duh! you just took dmg from him
is it not worth using turbo charge or do we not have enough FP for it?
if peach was smart once she got outside hit the blue switch and take the pipe to toad town LUL
everytime I see this part Im reminded of Jeny's clip lol
#clips for your viewing pleasure
i told komari about this...
I had a dream last night him and dalus rolled up at my house to pick me up for gdq LUL
even the life shroom?
whats the hidden blick then? a repel gel?
so weird not seeing exp dropped
i like it from the design side of punishing you from running, but honestly hate it
oh thats why you hate it LUL
can I just say... fuck that yellow fuzzy
"do what you did?" thats like saying "git gud, copy tas faker gamer"
checking in on hard mode to see where they are at
need to check my hard mode notes
almost 3 hours in and on A license
so not even cutman
fullfire, beetank2 and puffball, with a rockcube on each side is the last fight for A license, its soo bad
also bn2 hard mode is locked behind 10 secret chips which require pvp, and to get those both players need at least 3 title screen stars
thankfully wiiU patch fixed this
pvp was cool tho, there were so many randomly generated fields
oh no, his first visit to yum square he went to the correct warp panel last. This is a casual run with a timer on the gdq stage
and 2.4K people are watching this #socringe
they needed terra to do commentary cause no one else would.... almost like theres a reason for that LUL
komari finished his run before they finished A license, also gdq taking breaks doesnt help much
gl Phantom propokH /
i feel if a run is less than 3 hours it shouldnt need a break but thats me
is it weasle stomping day?
Hikari heard some thunder so she went into hiding
there was one yesterday
it completely missed here thankfully
we got light rain for 15 minutes
i messed with dk64 rando, not sure how I feel about it
I can see why this place can be terrible for rando with the amount of fetch quest required propokM
youd hate it for sure lmao
chapter 6 or the whole game?
id imagine id like chapter 6 cause less rooms to learn
yeah i see that
with my stick mash I hold controller with left hand and mash stick with side of middle on right hand
i wish bombette had stick mash LUL
I'm real bad at button mash...even worse with my worn thumbs :/
this game should be fun to learn :)
my button mash is so bad, the very reason I wont grind this game for top time
oh? didnt know that
Better lucky than good 4Head
okay, I've made a wrap/burrito and consumed it
also nice sneeze LUL
i know that feel
my ginger beer just explode onto my lap
once I PB'd with elec shield, I didnt split on gospel cause I didnt want it to PB LUL
random after this run?
what time is best for you on tue? I havent picked a time for mark yet
yeah, mark is streaming rn so ill hit him up later tonight
my friend recommended me zero sugar ginger beer after they brought to my attention that one bottle of regular gb is usually 90+% worth of daily sugar intake
phantom what is this mmbn2 run on gdq? it looks like a prank or something i dont get what they're doing
its a casual run on gdq stage
that's what it seems like
also phantom why'd you pick me out?
@Axl_Sensei are you for real
it looks like my first time playing but with "i have to beat it quikly" as my main goal
obvious they guy playing doesnt know bn2
thats what it is
did they make it to quickman yet
last I checked they were at cutman at 3 hours
"have you played bn before?" No
"do you know what bn is?" no
my blind hardmode run took 4:15
buff, make that a quote pls
and dont forget the PERFECT
finally a mod I can count on
I was gonna do a command
i wanna see phantombot say that LUL
or get TacoGuyy if I can't figure it out
@Tacoguyy your ass has been summoned
you said you submitted everything
im expecting you to do 6 runs there
phantom, viewership went up. There are 2.6K watching KEKW
PGB bragging about how good he is at BN LUL
is it bn2 or bn5?
terra even invited jameike on hard mode commentary and the man has NEVER touched bn2
considering the runner has no experience, I suppose it's appropriate
wait, right, you actually gotta play through Bowser's Castle
they cut the stream at shadowman and raided etchy
at that rate, they were gonna be there a WHILE
there was confusion, staff thought it was 4 hours but eta was 6 hours. 4 hours at shadowman is only half the run so I dont blame them
that's some slick movement
would you be interested in an actual hard mode speedrun?
so they just mery killed it? lol
oh? komari is going back to bn5
gonna jump over some questionable hitboxes are ya?
good times great oldies
the odds of 7 are hilariously low
do the quick kammy kill strat
"quick kammy kill" say that 3 times fast
did you get double 3 apped?
so whats bowser at now?
i haz cheese cake snack
peach wish harder!! phanto274BigRage
after this is a blind mmbn2 hard mode run
I can coach over VC
axl an hook you up
then full blind run, llets goo
ill do it blindfolded, only audio
real talk tho, I legit wanted to do a bn2 coaching with me only having audio
sends phantom clip "copy this rng manip"
bn6 rando? no way, get the fuck out!
would been fun with a rando
okay im done memeing
strimer, you forgot to split
unless you wanna do mine early?
i just sent mine over
thats what I intended
yeah just shop and key
im gonna have m4 do this too LUL
I have missed randl

How do I get him to ring my doorbell
i mean it was whatever I honestly was curious to see how long he would go
truly dedicated to the bit

Well they werent mean or anything
just so so very peculiar
yo his intro go crazy
kyle the ringer is in the belfry a bit of ringing up for the ringing up and pulling
thats what he wants his wrestling intro to be
realblopez: kyle the ringer is in the belfry a bit of ringing up for the ringing up and pulling
TacoGuyy: realblopez: kyle the ringer is in the belfry a bit of ringing up for the ringing up and pulling
the bot just got so much danker

I dont know if I could handle another encounter with that guy. again I ask... WHY ME
he hearted every comment
i don't know mitzi
@PerMitzi send him to me
good thing im retired from streaming
I will start streaming again for this man
pepeS i hope he has notification turned off
He also uploads videos of a british childrens show called big cook little cook
he wants you to ring the notification bell
yo "exploring new teletubby land in roblox" has 6.9k views
you can't NOPERS the funny number
that's banned in 5 states
your 5 favorite ones
solid, liquid, gas, plasma...? what's the fifth state???
Imagine having favorite states???wot
the 5th state is Ezekiel
please answer me a question
where did the name Ezekiel come from
I NEED TO KNOW
like, how did this become a thing LOL
God looked down and said "Holy fuck that bird is so round, that bitch is Ezekiel "
for some reason i thought your gf came up with it
BUFF00N WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT
but that also sounds like fake history
that's correct arie LOL
OH the LORE is CORRECT
@TacoGuyy I googled it
rip cheato said go to ch2
don't ask these questions. just be grateful for his gifts.
here's everything you'll need
streamer, looks like your enjoying my seed KEKW
HorseRide <- I like this
tried Strikers. it's decent. Refuse to purchase it until Daisy's arrives.
no daisy in strikers is criminal
As a Christian, I cannot condone this sacrilege
Buff00n is in fact my wholesome church friend according to a single white mom in illinois
Said white mom adores me
I peaked at the alt after combo breaker and I'm not gonna anymore
it is i think
race rules are a mystery
the rules are "no fun allowed" so probably banned
I hate fun
that bitch green as fuck
imo race rules should be "does it break logic?" "if yes, it's banned"
what if my logic is not liking fun
that requires me to know so much logic tho
I don't remember that one
you love to see it
after one I have to
hey, he earned that
phantomgamesbot is always here
why's the tree glowing
you schmooved on that guy
you run from shy guy he despawns?
what triggers the check for the mayor?
whats with all these fire flowers
how do they grow fire flowers in the snow covered land?
every check cant be god tier now
does that let your partners use focus? Never knew that was in this
i just got 3 cap jr in practice LOL
love having parakerry for this
a moment ago you were asking "what is this seed" look at you now
i think it should be, it only skips textboxes
an old spirit in burried ruins? makes sense to me Kappa
whats a hitbox? phanto274Shrug
felt like a good beginner seed
its fun to go nuts on LP
volcano has a bunch of checks too
put her back in the lamp
was waiting on that one LUL
Sad that we got the goomba
that shy guy tried so hard
im imagining general guy yelling at his troops for missing like that
just get lucky strats
1.41 to get a card oof
Toy Story 2 yeah LUL
super mega rusty lol
nice gl with that! I wanna try this randomizer eventually
gotta head out but have fun with the run!
of course! and you too! :)
blue key isnt required for chpater 7?
can finally get a hammer
I saw in rando discord someone had kooper in that mailbag check phanto274Facepalm
crazy how that was the first place it wanted you to go
having laki lets you skip bubble berry is nice
that looked like an erotic cake Kappa
Cley just finished and reviewed zelda 2
Just beat Zelda 2. the game was shit 0/100 I never want to touch shit fuck game ever again.
Bitch had rewind too
its fiiiiiiiine you have 17 life shrooms
Family really fixed the AC just to turn it off and never use it
it's like 80% humidity all week I just want to exist
this storeroom put me in go mode
this seed is "up and down and all around"
not too much, how's it going? haha all good, it's roopa
There's a zelda 2 defender in cleys mentions
i've been peepin for a minute, seems like a lot of "hm" moments LUL
i think the only partner i saw was bombette on rip
oh shit i didn't see para there too lol
this is the quickest I completed a seed so I wanted phantom to do it
there's no such thing as a "quick" seed
i have a hard time passing up the star stone check lol
oh! i had a mushroom so I swaped with life so they all matched LUL
My family safeguard weed for centuries. And now, I entrust you; Mario, to roll a fat blunt
the bat chose death
yo? almost enough for another rando seed
buff00n, how about I send this seed back in but just change the file name Kappa
damn, I tabbed out and missed crystal king
so my order was 1 4 5 6 7 2 and 3 last
9.1k points let's go
I have to go to bed within the hour, but you should be done by then
imagine if you skipped lantern and did that now Kappa
how can a ghost hit a physical object?
watch this be bubble berry
imagine not being able to headbonk the tree like a sigma
damn... 7BP power plus
what if this isnt it Kappa
moles never stood a chance
she used the graves of the mole to make the most fertile soil bawkSad
nice, you have no... mole... checks left KEKW
you did water stone tho
theres another water stone check?
omg the clutch lucky lol
almost half the time it took me, of course im not surprised
didnt know live splits did total play time
i just noticed something... the hud is purple and just so happened to match your layout
finally can put repelgjel to work
reminds me of mark's 10 cap fight
he one turned hallway bowser
this is why rando is fun
don't you only need more than 5 for turbo charge to be worth
jenysrPogslide jenysrPogslide jenysrPogslide GG
do it again but faster
YOUR MARRIAGE IS IN SHAMBLES
thanks for fulfilling my dumb request
SHE'S TAKING THE KIDS
Raid your local, your favorite people :)
funny how the only item you skipped was in the very first shop
I'm playing strive tomorrow
From the Hebrew name (Yechezqel) meaning "Round-ass bird", from the roots (chazaq) meaning "very" and ('el) meaning "fucking round". Ezekiel is a major prophet of Chapter 5, the author of the Kolorado letter. He lived in Yoshi Village until the babies wouldn't shut the fuck up, at which time he soared across the ocean.
Oh my gosh, did I make it to the start for once?
this Prologue looks different haha, I made an original joke
Too many voices in my skull. ;_;
The only command that matters is
dont tell toad but i blessed u and Axl, but not him
cuz he doent have that redeem
"Thanks for the good idea max burger taco" I have no idea what the captions are doing
we have good ideas, Taco
whats your favorite Pape speedrun?
i like ur controller input display its really clean
I should do a rando I haven't for a while
The updates looks really fun
Maybe I'll stream a coinsanity tonight just to see if I like streaming it
May as well stream something it's been 2 months lol
equip slow go coward
Honestly IS a useful one because if we post that for raiders then the view will count
looking back at my bracket from last night, that shit sucked lol
All those matchups are ASS
But I also chose to play millia so it's on me
But had Sol into Leo into Nago into Happy Chaos into Leo again into Sol into Leo again
Leo is generally accepted as the worst matchup for my character lol
why did they buff Leo in the first patch and why do I feel like they're going to do it again on the 10th
Ram is also not seen as highly in JP so she's on the table for buffs....
I already take 80% for one counterhit from her and her buttons beat all of mine I can't handle more
I'm just going to play ino if millia doesn't get fixed honestly lol
just give one of my specials a fraction of what they had
my issue with playing Solar is that he played Axl before Leo so he wasn't playing like a monkey and I genuinely couldn't kill Leo if he didn't kill himself
Patient leo is fucking horrifying
what if you had the power to harness electricity but then an italian bitch threw a coconut at you
Y'know I don't know why I expected anything else looking at I-no mods I just wanted to see if she had good recolor alts...
I blinked and you have all of the companions.
Jungle treasure frying pan inbound.
Refunded your shooting star.
But you already had all of the companions??? How could you possibly add another? Hacker.
He'll Para-carry you in the battle.
just 3-0'd a leo ama
i only know how to say the !speed language
i need a thing ik
i got to look at that on speedrun . com
rules: Timing starts when screen fades after you enter the dumpster. Timer stops when you hit the cutscene at the end where you go to the heart. Millenials ONLY.
world rec is 7 mins and 10sec
bc it glitchless it not for u phantom
i will go till i get paper mario...
that's too many daves
dave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave dave
"oh god i fell, im yellow now"'
There have been like 4 more submissions since I put mine for MWSF
@TacoGuyy my worst surf fail '_'
Goth girl kammy Flushed
"Golf girl" according to your captions
there is only 1 unique one
"I probably should have ."
"I probably should have a."
how much fp is charge
dam that's almost a cracked bounce arsenal
let's go minigolfing at port
if there's a casino then jesse is 100% coming with
this is not marbles...
sad he leaves at 1hp so you can't watt tap him
"nice cloths call on the heart"
NO! Timecube.com is down now? RIP
almost typed !play agani
both of my mega shark sting... u got mega shark?
use mystery on bowser
that seed was ass to me lol
after I finished I did a bn2 run, actually got a 2nd prism from chip trader phanto274Hype
I kept top decking both of them LUL
what really hurt me was I got the fortress key in ch 7, game overd and forgot to go back for it
streamer, why does Lan rub his face against the wall?
nothing much just chilling after doing some work
that's cool hope the project turns out well!
yeah I get that. normally me with like yt vids and stuff
you want a date?
its on the table, doesnt mean ill actually do it lmao
You're now a founder on my channel since I've removed like 9 of them
you were 11th actually
because the first 3 subs were gifts
buff00n kept hitting you when he got drunk
so you had tier 3's at the start LUL
yea if I just keep removing people it just funnels in a list of earliest subbed people
Honestly just funneling it out to the people who are always there
It like JUST dropped
I sent you the tweet like 15 minutes ago lol
I'm gonna put my founder badge back on
wish it was just in the fucking badge menu and not a profile setting
why did they put it in the privacy tab
Debating on keeping brett on this list
I love brett but he's never there lol
he's resubbed like twice for me but I also just don't stream
or stream when he is
tryna think who else would replace him though
oh god I removed one and it reminded me of a specific person I didn't want to remember existed
fuck him up anyway
ok after that I guess it ran out of people to pull from? there is def still AT LEAST trusty and lange but it just gave up lol
there is 1 badge up for grabs LOL
I should remove jesse
you subbed and it gave it to trusty
why didn't it just already do that
I was like I fucking know there's at least like 3 more people to pick from here
@Ohrocks He's going to skip gourmet guy
I also did that last night but that's not important
I gave him the cake later
should I give a founder badge to "glizzytickle"
So don't do a run on tuesday
Ok my founders are my best friend of 13 years, Josh, a streamer friend, jesse, you, plant, ohrocks, buff00n, trusty, lange
All is good now
@Ohrocks congrats on the new shiny badge
you'll be looking better than a Wendys4for4
what shiny new badge?
the 1st badge I currently have but on my channel
oh cool... you just have it to me?
I'm not upset just dumb
yo? stray is getting a physical release
I'm gonna lurk and play the fire emblem demo
twitter seems to like it so far but it's also fire emblem twitter soooo
I havent played the base game yet
I wanna see for myself
I'm too lazy to swap shit for monitors so I'm just going to play off obs
they let me turn off random tutorial windows
everyone is fucking dead
good cinematic to start
oh yea I LZS jumped on jr last night after the chap 7 fight
ok I'm tired of obs I'm plugging the monitor in
It's still early but this game is actually holding a framerate so that's already way better than aoc
instead of items you get combat arts you can use a certain amount of times a map
they drain weapon durability which is just a meter for them
doesn't affect actual attacks
not what I expected lol
one thing I like so far
is you hit max speed absurdly fast so you can actually move around bosses
also byleth said 1 sentence and killed all my friends
im sur ehe had a good reason
now protag lady is angy
I have 2 sword now
why is jeralt alive I thought they shanked that bitch in like chapter 8
I died and now have obtained sothis 2: the boy one
the lever is a story trigger for G guy to be gone
He looks like ghirahim but naked
he talkin shit now how do I kill him
ok the weapon triangle is still here thank god
it's put as "class advantage" but it's practically the same
also now that I have the power of god and anime they gave me a command dash and I fucking zoom
They told me to use claude to kill a wyvern but I also have grounder sooo
gl with the No Major Sequence Breaks? | !discord !pb, Paper Mario is one of my favorite games :)
I couldn't remember the bot message so I had to improvise
is 3 Hopes just the new protag getting stabbed by Byleth everytime they meet?
I got shanked once and now I killed a buncha people
THE YOSHI KIDS SNUCK INTO THE JUNGLE ! ! ! "Oh no! Anyway!"
I've not had frame drops in the 2 battles I've done yet
Everything is an improvement over that
man do I want to do BL or GD first
I think I'm leaning blue lions just for felix shittalk
He is genuinely like my fav 3h character and everyone hates him lol
Literally everyone is at this camp except bernadetta
Dorothea said she said if she went she'd die to bandits in the forest so she's just not here
why are you 10 minutes ahead
Dedue wants to cook for me I'm going blue lions
Sylvain already wants to fuck me
not my fault the male protag had bad hair
It's the case with like literally every nintendo game
we're just at a camp with everyone so she just talked about people there
Yea doing those multiple times a day was like the only way to beat the black eagles route on maddening
because the route was short but scaled the same as others so you just had less levels
Still have 0 fucking clue why that route was that short when it's that unique
the church route is also just literally a worse golden deer one
I think it was something to do with the Empire already controlling a majority of the continent
It's the same exact narrative but you don't have claude
M4 just started my seed LUL
Church route should've had Rhea playable
it's basically her route
cant wait to see him do lanterrn ghost lmao
Church route should've HAD rhea
you literally don't see her until the last 2 chapters
she's in prison with bad lady so you literally never see her until the end
3 houses is a very flawed game unless you just play blue lions and stop
Then it's pretty good
THIS MOLE ISN'T A SAVORY FELLA
He's just a savory fella
I am a student now wowee
Jertiza is my teacher
This game looks way nicer than 3 houses
All the models have crisper animations and a bit more polish to the texture work
they're actually moving in 60 frames lol
wow they dont let me pick my dudes for the first house mission so I don't get felix
kronya and monica are separate now i guess
Hai hai. : D
damn we rolled vanilla ck color
@TacoGuyy Kronya killed Monica and stole her identity in Three Houses
"We're gonna beat Jeralt and his Ashen Demon, then WE'LL be the most well-known mercenaries of the land!" Oh, honey.
not that I'm complaining, but why did this game's anime powerup zoom into the mc's titties
So I'm currently able to use every house member on this map at once
so I guess the cap isn't 4 in this game
I def like that way more with the ordering mechanics
a little early but GG
and you can stills tack units
Wow, Shez is fuckin' stupid
you won't get demonetized if I swear in chat on YouTube, right
@buff00n you see what pape chats talk about and you think swearing is a concern
also phantom already says the fuck word
call phantom to distract him from doing stuff LUL
I saw your tweet obviously
pape pape pape BLANKIES
yeah I can relate
Oh man I get like that where I cant do anything when there is a plan and or im anticipating something happen
my peeve is... my father calls to ask for a favor, "okay sure fine" then he goes on "how was your day?" I hate filler convos so fucking much.
Id be like "if it's important they'll leave a voicemail" LUL
so where im at right now, I get home and drop my phone in the laundry room and dont touch it until I leave. Cant do that with the new job lol
texting is more efficient to relay information
phone calls are not
I hate having my phone now, after holding it for 3 minutes my carpal tunnel starts
leaving for work in like 2 seconds but gl and I will leave you on for channel point gains
speaker is a god send now
Good luck at work TacoGuyy!
break a leg taco
Ty I uh didn't really sleep
Was up until 6 working on shit and then took a 2 hour nap and got up to keep going
and now I have to go do manual labor YEP
I slept so much and my eyes were still hurting
so if I do stream today itll be pretty late
I stayed up until 4 am cause I am so good at not keeping a schedule BLANKIES especially while unemployed
I can not wait to sleep at normal hours again
I mean either I sleep too much or not enough
I go to sleep on whims, lay down and it just happens lol
I am well rested now that im unemployed Bedge
I sometimes take naps even after I get like 12 hours of sleep
cant stop the beast
oh no, I need enteral darkness to sleep
so I have a sleep mask LMAO
I have cycles where sometimes I need noise to fall asleep and then sometimes i dont.
The Office has put me to sleep a many times :3
it was very nice
I have put on youtube videos but im out in 5 minutes so whats the point?
The thing is I have to know I wont miss anything when I fall asleep. so I HAVE to watch something I've seen before or else itll keep me up
sometimes, like last night Ill leave on randoms stream... then he raids and the other stream is so loud it wakes me up FeelsBadMan
yeah I gravitate to people I know or at least the same category, not always the best idea
Last new guy I raided I kept showing off his alerts. They were nice but it was a bit much lol
bob ross raid OMEGALUL
I am fully comfortable just ending my stream and not hosting or raiding
i'll raid some restream of a marathon before someone new tbh
ill admit, raiding kinda does feel like an obligation to me. Just feels wrong not to, but totally understand why others dont.
that's how i feel too
I had raids turned off for a while. But people would just host me and come in and say "the raid thing wasnt working" Madge
1 whole year? that means phantom has to acknowledge you now KEKW
Boris we need more emotes like boris
Boris Post Boris This Boris boris Boris To Boris Post Boris This Boris boris Boris
Henry Post Henry This Henry henry Henry To Henry Post Henry This Henry henry
water the flesh prison peepoClap
i swear if its 321
one day I will be right and you will reset LUL
ill take vip over a sub
it would be cool if paper mario had multiplayer
save 100K points or get fuzzy right... which will come first...
how would that work
only thing I could think of is p2 would control the partner in over world and fights
like say if one was done at chapter 1 the other could just go start chapter 2
so the kirby amazing mirror approach?
that would be cool for rando
the bot has spoken phanto274Bless
thats what it means by 2
did you ever play megaman zero?
I have the collection on DS and legacy lol
its kinda weird for me, I didnt like X but really dig zero
Megaman X is fine, but dont care enough to play any others
Megaman 9 is my favorite one, played that the most
despite most saying its the hardest its the only classic one I finished without save states
pie jumps are like easy but also hard for some reason. easy in practice but AYO in a run no no no
i am not a fan of pie jumps
canon jumps are POOEY tho
still eyeing the ninja turtles collection...
Mitzi, have you seen it?
HOT TAKES BY PHANTOM
and i aint a good masher
I lose runs to the cannon room if I'm unlucky
I can sometimes max hurricane
my mash technique really aint too good lol
one of my adaptors has a turbo function fifiBad
power shock bowser is free
the way this game reads inputs is so annoying for mashes
power shock on things that aren't like ch8 jr or hallway would be way more consistent if the inputs were different
that would get me to run all bosses again lmao
every run i played of that category died to anti guys
9 years ago today megaman was revealed in smash bros... what I day that was...
not even being biased, it's so sick
yeah, that had a budget back then KEKW
so many cool references in it
the cloud trailer is carried by it being cloud's trailer
there's not much special to it lmao
link vs pit in palu reveal was lit tho
Pyra/Mythra trailer was also carried
the greninja one was pretty cool too iirc
in rosalina I was freaking out KIRBY IS IN MARIO KART lmao
but yeah not too many good ones lol
I think it was Wii Rainbow Road
joker taking over the game awards was genius
im on 0 hours :)
what about megaman vs sephiroth reveals?
calling byleth cool smh
i loved PoR, have RD but never started it
really like FE7, first one we got on GBA
only FE game ive played is 3 houses
Sora was good, didn't have a lot going for him other than the final character
was really hoping sora would have antiform as a comeback mechanic
sora trailer was more of a "finally they put him in" kinda thing
love how they jebaited everyone with dark souls
oh yeah got into hotfix
no cat left behind
wasn't expecting it ngl so we take those
I thought that was the category, like you had to get all the cats in bowserrs fury LMAO
but it was ok aside from that
how is the ru-
a koopa troopa moment
better than 3rd try i guess
3rd try is the real "i wanna go for speedy record dammit rowf"
COPIUM here ya go
So I watched my 3 year old 16 star pb and noticed that I split late
so my pb isnt actually a 17:09...it is 17:08 lmao
then why do you do it so much?
just find a vanilla rando seed
idk, ive heard you say more confusing stuff than that
one day i'll dust off my wii u and join you
yeah prologue is just so draining and chapter 1 isn't much better
after my few yesterday i had to just nope out, only so much i can take lol
fuck jr skip lmao
Prologue Prologue Prologue Prologue Prologue
i can forgive huff not being around for at least being mentioned a lot and having a real motive other than being one of bowser's chosen dudes
well none of them are dudettes (except maybe LP idk)
reading through sonic fans ripping each other to pieces over shaky 144p footage of Frontiers is bloody hilarious
Should've been a "not" Black Mage partner in this game
or whatever those dudes are called in this series
how is it going
what time do you think you are going to get
I'm sure you're going to do great
I am at the pool fifiHYPEE watching pape while I sun bathe
Thanks for the tracker legend. I've been so addicted to randos lately. Had to say some respects
Every damn time boss it's amazing
After a couple runs im starting to memorize my checks and I couldn't have done it with out the maptracker I didn't know about the 2 checks in forever forest for 20 years of playing this game lmfao
that must be the 'doogan dicking' i've heard so much about
now onward to chaper 2
what is your favorite paper mario game
sticker star is so good tho ;-;
my favorite is paper mario the thousand year door
yeah ss is my favorite followed by spm and then pm64
ss was my childhood sooo
likes cp but not ss ;-;
color splash is actually good tho
new pape games aren't bad oldheads just want more rpgs
ss is only rated low bc of the 3ds
and bc the level system tbh
anyone who says new pape is bad have never played actual bad games
ive done my time
i wish the new games were as ow as the old rpgs
they're both bad so either way
any tips for new wannabe runners?
run while u still can
im stuck playing on a wii rom
im practicing lzs rn ;-;
i have prologue down pat by now
what other speedrun did you do
mario kaizo sr ;)
will you ever do a kirby speedrun
i used to glitch hunt for ss
I love watching TASs
something about people breaking the game in half speaking to me
well we wouldnt have some mg without tas
tas stuff is really cool but i don't wanna watch a whole tas
just the cool parts
boos are one of my favorite mario enemies
i like mario plush forever
basically a mario acid trip
As much as I like tas's, watching people playing Kaizo is always a good time
imo kaizo is just a great demonstration of skill
people who speedrun Kaizos scare me as much as people who get good at Tetris
and how far you can really push it yk
more freedom in a rom hack than Mario Maker
I've seen some crazy shit programmed into Kaizo
mario maker kaizo has just more borders so less room for creativity
have you ever play paper mario master quest
eg, a shell that gives you invincibility when you hold it
coins that you stand on if you're not holding a key
a challenge can be fun when it's reasonable
if it's hard in a completely dickish way, I'm not interested
I'm doing a level 1 challenge on the thousand year door
Lunatic in Awakening's a good example. FUCK Lunatic.
I like the route for getting Peril
who came up with that?
finish the heart attack
new pb on wii tetris
why can ppl still follow you if they're banned
how have i not made a burner called girthmaddi yet
chapter 3 is done
who tf is that
so this is someone with nothing better to do, I see
how can jr troopa fly through
but watt is a good partner though
Watt's good, the problem is; this is a speedrun
we don't need "good' partners, we need "optimal" partners
I hope you know you're my timer for tanning. I'm switching sides every chapter
that's quite the tech
Imma be burnt lmao
on reflection, why are these toads in the toy box
they could've been friendly shy guys
I started tanning in chapter 1
Go fast so I don't get burnt Kappa
I'm too used to rando, was expecting Tast T. to give you syrup or something else
if you made a tire list for the paper mario 64 partners who would be the best for a speedrun
best pb for me
I'm good, eating ribs on my lunch break LUL
Leftovers from last night lol
Rib meat as a sandwich gerbieGasm
That sounds nice! Rice on the side?
Ohhh the fried egg nice touvh
you finished half of the game good job
Hell yeah over easy is the best
scrambled eggs with grilled cheese tho ;-;
just woke back up, dont remember where you were at last lol
what's your favorite food mine is pizza
I think mine would be chicken wings
i expected you to say ribs
The lemon pepper they have at wingstop is good
I like burger King
I like spicy but damn if it's too spicy I can't even enjoy the food cuz I'll be dying lol
@mx_four tell that to @PhantomGamesBot LUL
the yoshi's are gone
anyways, pizza with ranch>
we gonna see random strat?
you guys making me hungry brb
I just setup up some chicken to marinate
firsties are just bulshit
HELLA looking forward to that being delicious
speaking of food I had some popcorn a few hours ago
I think we can all agree on one thing
granparents cook > everything else
I sorry for your loss
no way I lived in alabama for like 3 years
My grandparents raised me lol
have you played bug fables
earlier we talking about megaman's reveal being today, apparently 3 years was also banjo
Bug Fables is in that position where I'm unfairly comparing it to the game it's based off of the entire time I watch
and it doesn't do well in the comparison
I treat "A Step From Eden" the same way
yeah, navicust is a big part too
combat and the sprite work for me, Eden doesn't look visually appealing enough to me
what do you think of black pit?
don't get me wrong, BN stories after 3 are WACK
but you can try to have a good/interesting story
its literal gauntlets, the one thing we hate most about bn LMAO
I like the remixes black pit did
I like when rougelike is a mode, and not the entire game
yeah, like in bn2 I hate 3rd scenario the most just because of A license
I don't like the maze either
I ran a poll in komaris stream about sky gauntlets once, the result was viewers didnt know about sky gauntlets LMAO
BN3: You want Hub.Batch? WELL, have fun with this 20 enemy gauntlet!
sick burn, gonna need 350 pokedollars for the burn heal
I like quiz part
We left the pool. Gonna get froyo now
Thanks I shall
the fuck is frozen yogurt
something I, personally, am not a fan of
ok y'all are wild
I never tried froyo
mitzi, the stream is saying you are wrong LUL
@PerMitzi mate, I've tried
On God, I've given FroYo numerous chances
Froyo is so good
each time, I threw it into the bin
@PerMitzi W H A T
just give me cheesecake
ILL EAT FROYO AND YOU CAN EAT GELATO
@PerMitzi I'll shake to that
It has been shook
Tho technically isn't cheesecake a pie
it didn't come up
It has a crust
was gonna make buffoon say " i love butts"
beat ya to it
im not on mobile but still blaming it
so there is a thing about hard mode
I'm a sucker for strawberry, or mixed berry cheesecake
my save is on vba, and im not going back to that, so it requires a 100% on bizhawk
the hud will speed it up but still needs effort
Battle Network NEEDS multiple save files
I don't wanna buy a whole 'nother cart just to do a separate playthrough
did you know that these motny moles have a weakness to hammer throw
would you really go back to the first file?
I ain't resetting that BN3 Blue 100% cart I have
@Axl_Sensei for netbattle, yeah
you 100% theres no reason to return to it
I ain't throwing all that work in th garbage
not in game like BN
I've a device that lets me play carts on PC and dump em as roms
you can do that on gbi?
will be doing a bn2 run tonight to try something new
something no one has ever tried
is it a run of bn2
what do you think of the amazy daisy
bn1, 2 and 6 are the games I haven't beat
you remember the kotobuki elevator?
I didn't realize there were 6 of those
coming back to bn1 seems like a MASSIVE step backwards
bn2 still has charm
In the Kotobuki apartment, when all but one floor has been unlocked, the cursor in the elevator menu behaves erratically under specific circumstances. When the bottom left option in the menu is selected, and the player presses Left on the D-pad, the rightmost option (Quit) should be selected. However, in the Japanese versions, the second-to-last option (i.e. the highest available floor) is selected instead.
that seems designed just to mess with speedrunners
this incredible song for an area you spend, like, 20 seconds in
so if I am reading that glitch right we can skip all of apartment comps
honestly the clear sky sun room is the best song in the game
I thought the "Sunny" Flower Fields played if you went back to the Sun
yeah so streaming under retro to not attract teambn LUL
brb, youtube'ing sunny sun song
yo imagine if the first time we ever did that was during komari's hot fix LMAO
WHY'S THIS A BOP
You no reason to revisit the Sun
I went back there casually to go see what the sun said and just sat there for an hour
then again, these are the same people who made TTYD's file select screen have a 4+ minute for a screen you spend less than 5 seconds on
I wonder if we are going to see a giant
I was assuming they'd remove the flag that triggered the sad music after the clouds go away
not add an entire another song to replace it
2 more chapters to go
he goes live at 2am my time lol
hello there bagged milk
I watched one hour
i had a streamer show it off on stream lol
you put the bag in a pitcher and cut a little corner off
thats hwo they do it
thats why I make fun of it
better than pouring said bag of milk
have you seen powdered milk? you add water
I'm still adding milk to hot chocolate mix
but I don't understand this what is so wrong with pouring the milk first before the cereal
phantom ive got a great clip you need to see
this man green screened himself into bn mugshot portrait LMAO
lookin' like a friggin' codec convo from Metal Gear
I love BN npcs
they have good designs
I thought it was really cool to see bn integrate different races
I threw the clip in general
if only phantom had a channel for clips Kappa
@Axl_Sensei YOU WANT SOME MAH DIS WHISKEY
did you see the jameike ones I shared in there
in my defense, I thought it was phantom-specific clips
do you play Friday night funkin
I listen to some of the music
b side game over theme is fire
I bought TMNT Shredder's Revenge and am waiting as patiently as possible
waiting on Sonic Origins as well
you could stream them
whether I'll actually play the game idk
but I do want to
I never booted up xeno 2
xc1 is very possibly my favorite game
I bought a friend the XC2 dlc and that fucker NEVER played it
its the thought that counts
XC1 has better character design as well, imo
Mythra's design is better with the leggings
I don't accept arguments on this
damn, those plants were chillin'
I bought one of my friends persona 5, if it never plays it fine. Just holding on to it is enough for me
I preferred pretty much everything from the first game over the second
in going to leave for a little bit
although the second was still great
@superkirby879 have a good evening, mate
thanks for stopping by
for someone, smart, he sounds stupid
so you're telling me his Smash win quote: "I can change the future!" isn't accurate to his character for a majority of the game????
very smart but also horrible with people
I havent played super far into xeno 1, I remember getting purge tho
no he CAN change the future
he just doesn't actually tell people about the future
just cuz can change the future doesn't mean he WILL change the future
he changes the future in fights
did literally anyone ever use sharla
if my big red sword told me someone I know/met is gonna die, I'd think it's probably important to let those people know
isn't optimal postgame like
Hell, even BYLETH tried to save their dad when they watched him die the first time
dunban fiora someone definitely
dunban is the highest dps
it's been like 6 years since I beat xc1
I remember my older bro getting XC1 on Wii. Our Wii decided to have that disc reading issue the INSTANT he popped XC in.
I know ng+ speedruns use dunban mainly
but then every other disc refused to read afterwards
simply don't get hit
if only the attacks in that game had a reasonable hitbox
cant wait to see the 4 hr run
I mainly played shulk casually
after this are you gonna do another run today?
if you do im def sticking around for it
THE KING IS DEAD
what's the blu spinny lined
I forgot dizzy attack was a badge
we are at the home stretch everyone it's chapter 8 time
it's not worth skipping unless you go for 4/4 cannon jumps
I can do it but it's super cringe
I won't go for it unless I need it lol, it doesn't even save that much
and even then you really don't need it but it's cool to know how to at least
oh right this part of the game exists
loved it so much I gifted it a sub lmao
will you play fall guys
so messing with bn stuff off stream, using the hud I jumped from tutorial to A license LUL
I can't wait to play it
free to pay, I think
Laying in the sun really saps you of your energy shoosh4Sleep I'm in bed now and I might take a nap
I slpet so much today, will be ready to stream in a little bit
it's about 2:03 from fadeout entering quiz room
I think I got more vitamin d today than I have in the past 6 months
19 in the fight
save 2s on next split from partner swap ho
phanto274Hype I'm so hyped
70k tetris game ;-;
Is it worth it to go for more jumps in this first part? permitHmm
I'm positive Phantom would murder me if I did bad rng
if you do more than 4+3 he will heal in safe fight
I had gotten like 600+ bytes or whatever theyre called this stream
next stream imma binge spend them for ya
back when I started this time was top 10
im gonna spend 100k to get you to speedrun ss
I remember bluecrystal getting his time, was 10th place at the time
yeah, I ssw bn3 on the list lol
I will spend 200k points for that to happen
smrpg is a good game
`Oh I get back and you went fast
GG on pb though!
I'm 40K away from "Speedrun a new game"
how close is 15
I'd have bought that capture card from you if Glenn hadn't
@buff00n actual PC, first
start with goombario for a sub
Flinched when I hear Axl lol
@ElectricAxel as a "Brandon", I understand entirely
I never met this axl
Imagine having a second one of yourself
@Axl_Sensei I lurk a lot
I do actually know a second taco
totally didn't go to combo breaker with 2 tacoguys
Ive met axl_thunder and phantomaxl
@ElectricAxel yeah xD my rl name is also very common
yes chat therre is a phantom axl LUL
I would hope you've met phantomaxl that's your guys' son
taco I have a clip for you
dm me it this instant
gg all the way
how does random work
do we have traps?
forgot to ask for that
those who know OMEGALUL
Traps are really funny
Yo burger king did the classic
I got a custard concrete w/ cheesecake, pb cups and caramel
they put an onion ring in my fries
and it is TASTY
I hate it here
So its basicalkly just a 100% rng run
maybe you should start w/ Goombario more often
you started a new stream
I honestly like how the strive patch went
The tier list is pretty much the same order but the gap between chars is so much smaller it's crazy
I've watched you break those blocks a bunch, but I couldn't remember the order when taco was playing
He's the same spot lol
Faust got actual shit now though
just shows the economic status of the mushroom kingdom
Scarecrow mix has become the shit you were doing to me in xrd with the door
kooper has to sell himself for money
if kooper sold himself
who gets the money
the people he owes money
flower saver could be lit
he was selling money
I finished chapter 1 in like 25 minutes on the seed I did the other day cause they gave me a key right away and I started laki lol
Ok Ram is still doing ram shit they didn't really hit her besides the sword throw thing
gtg tune in later
I like the bots mindset
he just like me frfr
imagine me actually doing bn routing...
Mystery sol got 49th
is is a potential skip no one has done, also i does skip apartment comps sadly. I misunderstood it
he lost to "ARJAY!"
big d 3-0'd leon
Blacktwins already in losers
The N wasn't capital so I think it was bowser leon?
Oh yea that was lucina LOL
Big D is really fucking good
Doesn't big d like just have a life
He's just a GIGACHAD
The best lucina in eu :)
he'd do better if he swapped to Marth
jesse chag for top 24 winners qual
I pulled up a stream
and it was arbiter
I've not muted that fast in a hot minute
you were no longer audible
I just want game audio
He's EE without the dial
Although even full wilding EE will still be more chill than that because otherwise it loses its value
I've watched too many full drunk no filter EE streams
EE can catch himself, I've seen a stream or two where he almost said "motherfucker" but stopped short
That's a newer thing
He hasn't been allowed to get away with that habit for ult commentary so he's gotten really good about self bleeping lol
Especially for the extra nintendo gigs
Gimr wouldn't hire coney if he was still allowed to say what he wanted with tk LOL
Coney be saying some shit
Ludo got shit on in both ways by gluto
the whole set was battlefield
Wizzy kome is happening
how hard you think wizzy is gonna bitch about not whiff punishing after this
on his public or priv twitter?
the matchup isn't even as bad as wizzy says
It's a good wario matchup and mario has very similar tools movement and aerial wise he can weave through shit
yea you can get stuffed but your buttons are also god
and if he knew how to kill combo 
wizzy is just running in and swinging
he won't stop jumping and that's the only thing kome is swinging for
it's doable, but getting in is a pain
I forgot how much dancing blade sucked in Smash 4
wizzy just did run up nair up b
Rock climb with laki is cool
if you get on laki after you get on the first ledge for rock climb you just fall through the map and go up there
It's rad cause I literally can never do the 2nd jump YEP
Kome literally just sat at roll distance and waited for wizzy to mash at him and just ftilted him to end the set
Time to get ultra stoned DOUBLEWEED
"Heinrich hip ultrasound" thank you captions
all the time was wasted, couldnt get elevator glitch to do anything
i might be a v 1.1 glitch only and I use 1.0 for prism
so basically what it would do is let us skip the 2nd refights
when the fuck did kooper go there and why did he get spicy with it there
was it with kolorado Flushed
its not documented if jp 1.1 patches it or not. Just an assumption I always had
Esam is now playing the shulk that big d beat at genesis
big d beat him before losing to sisqui I think
Kels is top 32
was waiting for you to get it then mess it up KEKW
wheres the fun in opening the lock
I did shovel jump during my seed
it was very rad
seeing rumblings Banjo will be in microsofts show, but kirkhope says its not happening...
what's the star ghost gonna be
oop justice beat leon
25th for eu 
I missed the pb had to call a locksmith since my key broke on my apt door NotLikeThis lets gooo dude gratz!!
Very respectful placing bossman!
looking forward to actually watching smash at CEO
I thought about going but didnt know anyone else that was going
its a 3 hour drive for me
esam had a game 5 last hit and I can just see him sitting behind him watching baseball
is this frame perfect?
he has his priorities
I was getting a bit bored
big d riddles who you got
Bombette, I didn't know you had a sister
big d made a desync wall and then power geyser'd
that's really good hol up
he does nana blizzard popo up tilt when riddles goes for power dunk above stage cause it covers all drifts
he's playing this bitch like a puppet character how good are desync setups wtf
the other stream is pacman dark samus
riddles sdi'd a twitter combo and then dash attacked
he shot like straight behind ic's from blizzard
BOMBETTE DONT DRINK THAT
I said that name to Jibca and he immediately knew what it was
I just took a shot
I think he's been to combo breaker too much
XD hows it going? hows the rando so far? i found you on youtube thought id check ya out!
I'm uploading PB's when I start running again that shit is going incredible for you LOL
they are heaps good man usually just chuck one up before bed XD
I used to do twitch to sleep to but my usual degen streamers aren't currently streaming or streaming at that hour
Cause morph has a job now and Sway isn't streaming as much
Knives is already annoyed at me and buff00n from the groupchat so I can say that freely
that's a nice color for Kammy
we're both banned from knives' bathroom
larry got shit on
he died game 2 becase gluto held down during the back hit of up titl and fell out and ftilted him
oop jesse hit a run up fair
I hate that it works when he does it
cause he's patient the whole game and then he just says fuck you
He faired jesse going low and missed the cypher tech and died
Literally should've just daired
he was above him lol
yea chag is MAD jesse is just pressing now and it's working way too well lolll
he killed him in 30s lol
I mean you have boots and sushi so I'm pretty sure it wants you there by now
oh right I forgot you didn't get weight
man jesse is playing incredible right now
esam is playing mii brawler against sisqui....
Tea shows up on stream and all the kanji names in chat just say KAZUYA MISHIMA
Esam won game 1 on sbf then went pika for fd
Saving the yoshis has many reasons to why it sucks but the music leaving is so tragic
Tea went kazuya against tilde
tilde didn't ban fd
oh wait there's no bans
TEA DID ELECTRIC TO SUICIDE GRAB
japanese chat is just KAZUYA MISHIMA'ing even harder
welp esam lost to sisqui
his pika wasn't doing it after the brawler
Tilde is getting camped very hard by tea and it's really funny
peli vs shuton oh boy
lemme go to the bathroom now
Im not missing anything
hyows the rando going g
did you pb btw
YO WHAT AXL GIFTED ME A SUB WHILE I WAS IN A COMA phanto274Love
Thank you Axl phanto274Hype
What made this seed so bad?? phanto274Thonk
Chapter 3 has some goods ayo?
Find after find after find lmao
I'm curious to see what else there is
Chapter 3 was kinda loaded
Oh you can go to flower fields now too!
shy guys are so cute I can't
I wonder where the triangle stone is
you can beat 6 too cause we found the hidden dirt
I believe you found a letter for a boo too maybe they have the stone
People be giving you singular coins what is this lol
Seed said hold my beer
you could redeem it as a rando seed for ryan
I'd love to watch someone else suffer with this as well fifiHYPEE
I woke up right as we got the motherload chapter 3 checks
Watch gourmet guy actually have the stone
poor guy was stuffed in a block and couldn't deliver his letters
Oh ok hologram parakarry got it covered
I am scared to start randos
we have 2 park submissions its a good chance it gets in now thats neat
I live 20 mins away from the venue so i dont need any intricate planning at all hehe
wild how dog island got in LMAO
dog game go fast
forgot the bubble berry Kappa
did you learn your lesson from my seed?
mole fights had your poop
is this your 33rd rando?
remove power plus Kappa
do you have both damage dodges
look at this clip
wizzy is back to form
Where was the triangle
in one of the vines
also AXL! thanks for the gift sub
phantom picked goombario so I tossed some coins in his hat
sure but id require 2 sub for a goombario seed KEKW
then our race we started goombario and 1st check had kooper lol
actually starting goombario isnt that bad cause to game is forced to give you another partner
take a volt shroom for back up
twitter you had one job
its some battle network fan art but it has the pokemon trend tag
Any% runners should've just modded me in their chats to win lol
my strat works so well
youve been live for 9 and a hlaf hours
go for 10 bitch
I'm hungry for 30 more minutes of content
eat a life shroom then
you got enough to feed the homeless
up and away him
sees image of ps2 "first game you think of" first 3 games I thought of werent on PS2 so I went with sonic heroes OMEGALUL
ps2 was the worst version
he pinged me with that
How does the feed was me
I assume that was dodge master but still what's the 9 cap odds
m4 is doing fortnite but I have no runners on my list
thanks for the stream
I think rando is healthiest in small doses
Also the game is a bit louder than you
What's more powerful: pacepals or rando viewers
Simply stream under pokemon pinball
I mean mainline pokemon is just the same game each time
the only useful ones are like languages, challenge runs, and wr
When I streamed poke rando most views came from the challenge tab
that's been me for windwaker
And if you figure it out let me know please
At least pape people are cool and will lurk anyways
Well at least for the actual runners
After I finish this last bit of schoolwork and actually have time not spent to just this and work I'm gonna start ori 2 for real this time
Very much procrastinated this shit and it's why I've not slept the weekend I've just been doing it before and after work YEP
It was like the last couple weeks I just didn't do yet
I already finished history cause I just wanted that shit over with
It's so fucking boring
It was american history for this year and like
I don't care what terrible things the us has done let me exist I'm never using this and I've already shot it back out of my brain cause I dont care
That's been my mindset for like all of highschool tbh LOL
Like I'm doing well I just don't care at all
My mom can't even do basic math anymore so I live with an example of why this shit dont matter
She's a librarian she doesn't need anything besides the one thing she liked
Like i'd rather worry about shit when it actually matters for me
can you go fast?
Yea most of this shit is just there to teach me how to solve that sections problems and then I just don't need it ever again lol
Made it very easy to put this off in the first place cause I just didnt want to
anyways back to it I go weedMario
thas cause you're a nerd
Jesse is a bigger nerd
You're a cool nerd
He wants to count coins
I was tempted to post the pasta but I don't think I want the bot to have that
I don't want the bot to say "3' tall and 63.9 pounds to handle human dicks" in the wrong sentence
or any sentence honestly
what's traffic in Seattle like?
welp, we'll figure it out
bitch you live in illinois
live in the suburbs does not equate to driving in the city
just don't be a bitch
I'll toss you the keys
and tell you "don't be a bitch"
just get good at driving you two
I mean I won't be a bitch but you'll also not live long
I'm okay with these terms
phantom doesn't seem to object so let's die at port priority
just drive in a straight line and its easy
I'm 100% down for driving to that bakery
please tell me that bakery's still around
we can make a detour
it also depends when me n' TacoMann get there
and it depends on when we get a ride
no text box :)
I'm fine with that
what day you want us over?
I can do Wednesday
PP is Saturday and Sunday, according to my calendar
so we'd have Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I mean, I'm coming from midwest
so, if I leave around 10am, I'll prolly get to your area around 9 or 10am your time
I'm down for a good time
haha buffoon said PP
even with that bs and the fact i forgor'd 2 friends
i still was like a minute off
had to be like dugtrio
they made it get heccin meowth
my favorite part of the run, domestic abuse
fuck that guy, forget him anyway
go get dinner with glaceon instead
Become the homewrecker buff00n dreams of being
my brain is not functional
It didn't click I said the wrong one until you said that LOL
I've slept like 6 hours the past 3 days so I'm not taking blame for that
I named my mega blastoise blaziken
I also got a sandslash that I named poncho and I genuinely don't know why that was what came into my head when I caught that thing
But he has drizzle and thousand arrows
He tried to learn morning sun but like
My Conkeldurr has just been mashing acrobatics the whole game and the only thing that's lived is the arceus lol
TTYD in general is super fucking hard
Then you end with rng and difficult as shit
At least pg skip is really easy besides the roll clip
Just have to learn the texture
cavern is the globally least favorite zone by casuals
The playstation store listen tekken 2 at 10k
The best cases are all of us or all of you because even if I'm not in I will just win the smash bracket
lemme see if anyone else submitted a zelda lol
Yea when I typed zelda I saw that LOL
why are we beating up the gible
That person described both games as zelda
Gible has it coming
WHAT that's how you make friends???
Brady's pokepark desc starts with "You will play as pikachu." and idk why that feels threatening
pikachu really said be my friend or else
raichu took a hit for torchic
I subbed from both accounts :)
oh i already was subbed
its because of raichu Kappa
had to be documented
this games speedy spin?
that chase lasted like .01 seconds
my god pikachu really just kicks everyones asses
Nago's beyblade in strive is a disjoint too thas crazy
oh my god pikachu carrying things
"We wanna help you by fucking you over"
Golem loves straight objects
Yea he just really liked your work
no more straight things Gayge
what is this game
abras a freaking sniper
so where is the most time save
the map looks like a zelda dungeon
blastoise started with a lil spin
how would you even do that faster
wow pikachu really can just side step those attacks lmao
O there are so many nuances to the movement
That looks hard tho the camera and everything monkaS how much time is lost when it gets messed up
I like this game. Why have i never heard of it?
I had a wii phanto274Thonk
yo this a bop
omg the sign matches him
this is one of my fave pokemon
dont tell jumpluff to shut up its adorable papeHands
the loading screens are also lovely
the movement looks like it can be a bit finnicky
is there another way to move?
ok i like this game less now LUL
I am not a dpad gamer
literally a blimp of rayquaza
this is fall guys
whatever this pokemons name is i forget
KWAHZA is how i say it
the official pronunciation is whatever i read it as lmao
pikachu a gardener now
Bathroom break worthy cutscene at the END of a videogame? Heresy.
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
to be fair this probably wouldnt do too much damage to the world
it doesnt look that big of a sky island
the music is stressing me
it was ascending menacingly
That sucks so much ass
Item slides in lava are stupid hard. It only saves like 4 secs optimally haha
I just put some mozzarella cheese sticks in the oven. : D
I'm lactose intolerant D:
Thanks. ;_; They are so delicious though.
This is a strange Paper Mario rando.
No no, you're good. You've got this
start telling people to sub during your randos
Look at the camera after a chapter and say "sub bitch"
he may have record
But you have Boris
I'm goin to AS again this week
Taking jaemi with this time
gotta get 2 st cloud in top 8 this time
gonna be lurking. Gotta pack for a wisconsin dells trip with some friends
"Shaking master" You very well know the proper term is waggle warrior
Make sure you go to the bathroom as soon as the credits roll, even if you dont have to.
Me and brady at least already live here
So if we dont we can just be there anyway
Brady is closer than I am lol
Tbh I just hope they release the gamelist pretty quick so we can just book shit without worrying
Tas turtwig thats huge
I mean there is things to do in the city and a tournament happening for like every FG so it wouldn't be awful if we just went without many runs to be a part of
i dont need a hotel im so close lol
Cause they had like combo breaker numbers of brackets last year at 2dcon
Idk how well each one was ran but the smash one I've been told is usually good
My gold split tutorial is 2:17
Ive only ever gotten one
Yes left saves a sec
The more frontiers gameplay I see the more I feel like game is gonna be shit
It looks so slow and limited movement wise
Let sonic fucking run stop making him need fucking resource to do it
Sonic mania and heroes have been the only games ive enjoyed
People are so obsessed with Sonic but the games are so donkey ass
Sonic has a very terrible lineup of games compared to other franchises that have lasted this long
@TacoGuyy a hands-on said that there's a "action" setting and a "high-speed" setting in Frontiers. Most people opted for the "action" since they're getting a feel for it
Why make good gameplay a toggle
Because people don't know how to play Sonic games
SEGA DOESNT KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM
How do you even play sonic games
just fuckin go fast and jump around
Its just jump and run lol
Get from point A to point B as fast as possible with flashy shit and cool areas
Not rocks and grass and crawling without resource
Modern sonic has been trying to make the combat better each game but #1, they've failed horribly #2, who plays sonic for combat
If all of us get a game into midwwest speedfest that would be awesome
And i can totally see glenn getting park over me haha
They have a lot to choose from for me 
Brady if glenn gets in over you we will beat him up outside a perkins
gimme a game that's nothing but Daytime/Modern gameplay (ie Boost) the entire experience
If you get pape in I can commentate
This is really good so far phantom wow
ill just shut my mouth
yea you did this brady
The cheese sticks are delicious, by the way. : D Alas, I can hear my stomach going "Why are you like this? Who hurt you?"
It's fine. The stomach pains from my lactose intolerance still have nothing on my cramps. >:I
@VikiHexen why do you do this to yourself
Besides, I have a Nintendo Switch. I can go live in in the bathroom for four hours later. KEKWait
if i get in im gonna do torterra mid run to be funny
Dark souls boss of this game
I had a coworker who left early because they ate a truckload of cheese despite being lactose intolerant the night priot
Theres a cheeky lil tip that can save you loads of time
Spamming the camera button while turning makes your turns tighter. You just save more time for free
2 ways to kill your run in meeting place in a span of 2 mins lol
Quiz resets are the worst feeling
Krabby somehow is 4 legged
I'm a gold pal fuck you
wait gold digger is a better term
Imagine watching a sm64 runner and being a golddigger
I've watched so many sm64 runs from top players and I've seen them gold like 5 times
I saw slipperynip gold whomps a few months ago
You can get oddish on the way out from venusaurs
Hows beach zone going im done packing now
How do you like the speedrun though are you regretting it yet
No dont grab lumber before cutscene
Im glad to hear that though
I skip my splits when i move off route so my sum of best is mostly correct
I skip if i get treecko
my new route skips teddi in favor of burmy. It loses 2 secs but its consistent
isn't burmy in the treehouse
If i get a red berry in tutorial then i replace ursaring with burmy instead
thems fighting herds is on sale phantom should I grab it
did you talk to the static one?
So hypothetically speaking, if phantom beats glenns time does that mean glenn is going to have to return to any%
Wii park has fog inside cavern zone but wii u doesnt
No. I mean you stand at the rails and look at dugtrio and theres fog in the air there. Thats the only spot and its weird and makes no sense
Its hard to explain but wii u and wii feel different like the wii version is just grittier and more grungy
Wait there isnt fog on yours wtf
Maybe its a jp thing cause on jp theres a shit ton of fog i swear im not bananas
Does this pb have 2 irons
we want gold right
Yeah its fucking nuts
Theres a line on the ground right that i use
Its a big line though not some random ass pixel lol
Rhyperiors is a cool concept atleast though
But haunted is overall my favorite zone. Design wise, the pokemon, almost no rng, funny jokes, great zone
WR is 2:18!? :O by brady oh my we got royalty
I've met brady in person so does that make me famous by association
well i havent so brady is royalty to me :)
Oh course you like haunted zone dusknoir is there
Quiz lost you a good 40 damn thats rough
A lot of movement mistakes in ww can lose me a minute+ or the run
Which is why I'm absurdly conservative compared to alberto with the hard shit loll
Missing an item pick up loses like 3 secs its absurd
I don't feel like losing the run to save 3 seconds
pikachu is fucking dead
Jp quizzes are brutal
Y'know what we gotta do
get that shit away
Lost a 2 minute jp pb to porygon z quiz. One of the quiz answers werent in the document and i got it twice so i lost every ounce of time save
oh shit my b
Pokemon runners are very very dumb
I love this minigame
Wait what about easier languages what lol
pOKEMON ALSO HAS ICONS FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING
and dialogue is fucking yes or no
Thats kinda ridiculous lol
I've never played windwaker in english for runs it's really really not hard
I just learned my menu text for things
Ah yes cause theres an objective fun
BITCH WINDWAKER HAS MENU BASED GLITCHES
And our damn menus don't have icons it's just the damn text
or just dont get confused dumbass
guess what spanish word that is :)
how could you tell that's for confusion
wanna know what paralyze is in spanish
it's very hard to tell :)
Pokepark is literally just based
The one good pokemon community lol
we just want our funny little pikachu game to go fast
English is faster than all the ofher pal languages ironically
Mismagius has become one of my fav pokemon lately
Psr discord is harder to listen to than twitter
don't you like them making a category for a single trick at the end of the run
Imagine having a leaderboard split for puppet ganon skip
If they said that
I would run in spanish and submit
Since I've never been there I would just show up
I kind of want to now
Then tell them to fuck off because it's dumb
So they get someone refusing to run because of their dumb board lol
i just got into an hour long argument in the multi mario server over a new src rules NotLikeThis
they allowed you to cut out a game in a longer run to be able to submit for 2
like you can take out your galaxy game in order to submit for say sandbox
TA instead of RTA basically
oh im in favor btw
yee imagine doing a 1962 and being able to cut out BF and can submit for 1862 if your race order is differenty
the bot agrees with glenn
well i had to deal with 3 hardheads that just kept saying the same dumb shit about it ruining the "integrity of the leaderbaord"
they started going after mods too it was real dumb
its a positive but they were too busy not reading what the rule said
thats def what one person interpreted the rule to be
no they just couldnt read
there's currently a poll and its 45-5 in favor
he's def one of the most known
the best is odme CoolCat
when we hang out at midfest does that mean im a well known multi mario runner fourthgenBLUSH
@Glennjaamin nope you still not famous
kinda spoopy if ask me
i did 1 602
so im built different
he's a top sunshine runner
honestly sunshine is now not my worst mario game
galaxy 2 is way worse
Galaxy 2 is just bad
I main fighting games but I fucking hate the smash people so I don't
I'ma start streaming strive if I get it to run smooth with obs
Should prolly try that again now that I fixed the drivers
honestly id love to be a park mod
I would submit a park 1 run if he got mod just to make him watch it
I'd shittalk him the whole time
The 3DW community still hasnt put me on the cat ext board CoolCat
m4 is my favorite
you dont mod a community right phantom?
Youll love rhyperiors attraction during all friends tomorrow phantom
you doing all friends tm?
when you thinking of starting the run?
Practice attractions beforehand honestly
random% is kicking my ass
i need a break
i died 8 times td in 7-4
and i wanted to go fast
Spamming camera will also make you go up the treehouse stairs faster
ima probs submit park all friends to RRLAT one day
really really long a thon
Imagine trying to commentate during attraction grinding
remember it aint all of psr just switch psr
they the dumb dumbs
oh yeah its a lot of the same 3ds community but the 3ds community is actually good
@Bradybooo pikachus buddy buddy adventure
josh setup a whole 3ds pokemon speedrunning contest
and oras fixed their shit ending time
it was post credits fight to brendan, now its hall of fame
Star rod just feels better to split at
it has the music to it too
thats how josh felt about the oras fight
There's a reason people mainly say gg at starrod
the run is over lol
person ahead of glenn washed
wait what if it's my turn
we can just leap frog up to brady
do it i aint gonna run any% seriously for a while
I may do one for fun but like if I was gonna actually run park I'd do 2
i wanna learn ORAS atm
I wanna commit to ori after I finish this last bit of shit
Good shit, going to bed gn
look at pulse if you wanna learn firered
there's manipless and manip
make sure to tag me
@Glennjaamin I think it's good that he died
Mine has 490 views get on my level Phantom
I'm telling you its forbidden time save
hand written notes lets go!
did you makes these notes?
what drew you to this?
been thinking about stream schedule stuff, will be nice to actually keep up with that. Just need to see what nights the new job leaves open
with my days off changing every 2 weeks I just couldnt commit and didnt want to change it every 2 weeks
with bn being a shorter game I was able to do more attempts vs something like pape
Is this a mixed dex then?
oh I learned something recently you might find interesting
so in pape the seeds are called fushiginatane or "mysterious seed"
I knew I heard that name somewhere before....
Bulbasaur's name is fushigidane or "isnt it weird?" But know I know wherre the pun came from LUL
I wanna see you win this race with regigigigas
but his ability slow start Kappa
he did his best
also found all the your partners first attacks are name after them. EX Shell Toss would be Kooper Attack.
But Bombette's name is "Pinky" so her Body Slam is literally "Pinky Attack" which I find uncontrollably funny.
gotta friend them all :D
not much just resting
is it a random pikachu?
Hello phanto274Lurk I'm waiting to get my hair cut
like you playing as
And then I have to go grocery shopping permitDead I hate doing errands
Haircuts scare me. I love my hair
good luck on friendship
If I were this pikachu I would just accept death cause no way I'm making that many friends lmao
id give up immediately bc my limbs are too stubby
Buy followers, primes and viewers on mystrm .store

falls in water "hey let's be friends"
oh no, Jugoomba is taking bn2 next... goodbye my top 3 spot
after that he will have WR in all 6 games axlsenS
no cause I forget to eat food
food just slips my mind 100% of the time I be on Twitch
the times are so close, so why is pokemon split between US and JPN?
the not getting along parrt
I enjoy a good phantom shitting on psr stream
Vaporeon is a Pok'mon in this game?
someone call the quiz king?!
why is wingull on the GROUND
You just beat a grandma
If your uphill of him, he'll land faster
well fuck, there goes my productivity. Pokemon twitch channel is streaming gen 3 anime LUL
They just met Mr. Stone of the Devon Corp
Sends out Crawdaunt, Chat: BIG MEATY CLAWS!!
I love watch dumb shit with chat
are you running on emulator or on console?
can you run the game on emulator? cause I remember the game having alot of wiimote stuff
rule #1 blame glenn
my route would have you stop by Taco Bell and get a Baja Blast before starting the timer
Why the category shift?
That Scizor is dark as hell. What did they do to my boy???
You use other Pokemon in this run?! Holy.
Could you theoretically Pikachu only this run?
Do you get more than two health blips on Pikachu in this run? Or is that still just not a thing?
I'd consider what just happened as Hitmonslaughter.
xD Your speech to text for that was hilarious. It picked it up as "Hitman, slaughter." Like you're giving a command to a Pokemon.
So, like, I'm not the only one here that understands that Pikachu is just bullying everyone else into being his friend, right?
Is that Goofy's voice actor playing Torkoal? xD
You can't unhear it now, can you? Haha.
i am eating for the first time today. I got some sushi
to be fair i woke up like 4 hours ago
idk its like a party platter
I made hamburger helper. : D
party of 1 platter
ohhhh a french dip
quilava turns into a roly poly
my god he's throwing a fit
can you stop shittin fire OMEGALUL
the slow mo makes them recoiling from the attack so much funnier
caught in the crossfire my guy
we all need a little shock here and there
just a lil sting
yo my haircut didnt go too bad. Tho she cut off like an inch and a half clintB muh length
But does Lightning Strike twice in the same spot?
fucker got hit a few times Kappa
pikachu is literally perpetually concussed
someone get this poor pokemon in a dark room with no stimulation so their brain can heal
no time for friends when you're concussed smh
why do you need gold?
D: hitmontop a gold digger
THEN WHY YOU DO HAVE TO DO IT???
hitmontop exploiting you for free labor
1/5? we've done like 7
with those guys wanting to mess you up

i just recommedn letting them come to you

I myself found my old copy of pokepark and im 100%ing it before learning the run and im in eternal attraction purgatory :)
flying pokemon are awesome in this game Keepo
rude to burmy NotLikeThis
Just think, you're only like.. half way there. : D
hit lever -> go to ttar -> absol shit
make more friends slowass
wtf this man is 5 minutes behind my pb
why was that so close
waggle warriors dont need arm health
i found my old copy of pokepark wii :)
you know what tha means
Why did they design lopunny like this and expect nothing bad to come of it
I added this earlier cause plup had it lolll
I have join the poking parking discard phanto274Smile
Look at chikorita go
The bean boy bookin it
it's trying its best
time to get the only wr that matters
Magikarp on Empoleon's Snow Slide
honestly suprised they didnt allow magikarp to do every attraction as a joke
he has a lot of them
why cant magikarp do Aqua Dash tho LUL
cause we alrewady have slowpoke
brb learning how to mod pokepark to somehow allow magikarp to do alll attractions
wym im perfectly sane
Knives put her traits in akinator and got kokichi from dr3....
I'm scared to see who pops up if I put my traits in
Akinator will just say "Some bitch"
Each time I've dyed my hair I've done more and more red should I just do full red at this point
Yea I'll prolly just go full red at somepoint before doubledown
Maybe after I'll make the fade black instead to go with it
you're right, i have no idea
i've only seen pokepark 2 all friends before lol
that in terms of pokepark friends
vaporeon is the most cool
(that's a lie furret is in this game, sorry vaporeon)
yeah furret's only other appearances than the absol game are hide-and-seek and it can be seen in the meeting place
it do be a long lad
Tropius got a buff00n dumpy
That reminds me knives has not said a single thing in our group chat since I posted a weed mario
failing or hitting play again by accident
this is for LatiasCheck
smh what a bad turn 1
thats not #1 Kappa
Someone in coneys chat didn't know wht a blowjob was and he banned them
TacoGuyy ruined my favorite Water-type
Ohrocks ruined it for me
Why'd you bring me in????
Why'd he bring me in
I've done nothing to you to warrant this curse
look there's been a lot of nights where you made me sit in smash training room for 5 hours
I could've been gaming
I didn't have mods then
Slowpoke is so talented
Coney is teaching me that I should never trust any woman's affection it's a trap
aw hell nah pikachu got the disjointed hitbox
yo the 4k shot
RareChar RareChar RareChar RareChar
Chikorita is so talented
Hey bud, been watching your paper Mario randos on YouTube. Good stuff :)
Ngl that was the length of a wanna become famous and I was about to reactionary ban LOL
The :) saved them LUL
how much longer do we have for this run
Anyways, good luck with closing out the run! I'm gonna go shank the locals (in DBD).
Anyways, good luck with closing out the run! I'm gonna go shank the locals
Nomura said in an interview that he was pickier with sora in smash than disney was and why are people surprised
He didn't know how it would "affect the plot"
so he genuinely does think every time sora shows up it's canon LOL
Kingdom hearts in general is a fucking mess
I remember that fucker from pixelmon
I open twitter and see adhd explaining how ganondorfs nose is better than his dick for sexual purposes and I'm going to leave my computer now I think
"Go for the huge shnozz, the ganon jr looks feral and is underwhelming"
Is hitmonlee a shoto
brb have fun making friends 
make all the friends already
Long stream long stream
It was fun, making some progress on KH3
how youve been buddy tyronLove
I'm busy, but alright
no need to say that
I'm debating on if I wanna stream something
I grabbed tacos and horchata with my cousin, so I was lurking
now do it again
at least you arent playing park 2
i goofed in 8-6 and then died a lot in 404
Let it get to me? I'm just gonna creep, Down in Pumpkin Hill I gotz to find my lost piece.I know that it's here, I sense it in my feet, The great Emerald's power allows me to feel. I can't see a thing but it's around somewhere, I gotta hold my head, I have no fear. It probably seems crazy, crazy, a graveyard theory
guess who just woke up?
Hikari just came in
hiding under some stuff
there is thunder outside
know what's awesome about doing rando with mitzi?
letting her find goombario LUL
question about your tracker
how does it know how to update based on seed number?
did you know the mayor magically wakes up to accept a letter from you and parakarry the first time you talk to him and then passes out again :)
if you have his letter and parakarry out
MOTHER FUCKER WOKE UP AND I WAS SO CONFUESD
yeah mitzi, phantom always does that lmao
mitzi, are your pupper afraid of thunder?
uh we dont get much so im not sure tbh
it's like Lan rubbing his face against the wall lol
we had 3 red koopas
OH BABY A TRIPLE
yesterday in another seed I did Posie gave me a pebble out of her tree. Like oh yes. this pebble is so beautiful thank you
ive been relying on quake hammer for my seed. only costs 1 FP
I understand the rando hype now.
freaking chomps ruining the fun
i like the color of these chomps
AYO the water rock
I converted Mitzi permitWow
watching one of my friends play bn6 casually. He has a beast gate and is slotting in chips. He just used the Bass Gigachip lmao
bro i need the weight im suffering
my seed is poopoo
oh, your playing a seed?
super casually like not going fast or nothing lol
I started with kooper
ive got erryone but sushie
where is the fish dammit
i like doing slow checks
like.. kill goomba king? say less
my dictionary was behind pit
when people give me mushrooms at checks....
a part of my soul dies
KOOPER why did you have Tayce T.'s FRYING PAN
has there ever been a big check beind anti guy?
what were the signs? clintT
anti guy had a coconut for me lets gooo
he really said "I will guard this coconut with my life"
Watt had the WEIGHT
pulse stone was in the library boxes. I almost skipped that phanto274Smile
I literally would have just quit cause i for sure wouldnt of found it lmao
500 points away from another rando seed
yeah when I redeemed the one I was at 55K
which one are you gonna give him axl :3
dont know... he hated the last one OMEGALUL
are you torturing him with bad seeds lmao?
do you wanna try it LUL
im still looking for the damn fish
funny how we never found the odd key
oh phantom, yesterday I send mitzi the seed and she booted up a completely different seed LUL
listen i never said i was smart
I get the full Mitzi experience
I wanna hear gamesbot say that quote
also speaking of gamesbot
ive seen a few games I own, like No More Heroes
oh well I guess you gotta play em fast npw
the bot demands it
I was like level 12ish?
since yesterday seed wasnt used on my rando splits im running live splits for 6 hours to add it to my total play time
oh no, found something we will never agree on LUL
so in bn4 all dark chips are null meaning metal soul can charge them for double dmg with max HP dropping
can one shot aquamanOmega with just darklance doing 1800 dmg
people are subtweeting nintendo xenoblade tweets, so hard to avoid it
phantom starts stream just as I wake up lets gooo peepoClap
yo! you streaming under retro too LMAO
mitzi, you need to get around to playing one of these one day
The only megaman I ever played was the one you could kick the can
I wont be here but id say the parasol cutscene
im acttually about to shower and get ready for work
that child already had a receding hairline
i gotta let the doggos out brb
hope you enjoy the condensed alphabet soup
it hurts so much i cant stick around for this sun-baked hot gargage
also crosses are not shuffled sadly
okay im legit sad I cant stick around for this
thas him on my screen
Someone on twitter popped off for me for beating jaemi and I was like "We've had like 30 bracket sets and he's my practice partner"
Idk how people don't know this he's literally the only person I'm with at these events LOL
Also it's like the most even sets possible at this point every time is last game last hit cause like
He's the player I know best at this point
But yea I won a game 3 last hit by running up to him and harding reading an empty jump with waft at 50
TacoGuyy your color reminds me oh a popsicle
is that a good thing
I opened 7tv and it was on your tab so I saw the emote approval notif lol
Oh yea last night someone was talking about how EWGF in Tekken is an unsafe high risk/reward move but like
The only point of doing electric in tekken
is to make it +
It doesn't add to combos lol
as long as you have recov10s
People just want any excuse to bitch about kazuya in smash but if you bring up tekken mechanics at least make sure you know how it works...
Komari, Im counting on you for clips. Ill be leaving in a few axlsenRip
just get null chips and you're good COPIUM
@Axl_Sensei shit, I'm actually gonna do BN5 soon
The retro category exists for older games that dont necessarily have a following? clintT
watching GMD resets Kappa
I use retro to hide from trez
bblstar is pretty cool
Oh so its a way to hide too
little boiler doing work AYO
People on twitter are now saying that Xenoblade and FE are causing us to not get new games people "actually want" :)
what kind of logic is that clintT
It'd be crazy if nintendo like had different studios making different games
That'd be unheard of it's all nintendo :)
People are also saying why don't they just outsource IP's to get new games for things and like
DO THEY NOT LOOK AT WHO MAKES ANYTHING
I wish natsume would make good harvest moon games again clintB
Who needs those when RF is thriving
The OG harvest moon devs stuck to that after the dark age of HM started
it's good you can charge it COPIUM
Game was even called fantasy harvest moon for the first 3 LUL
yo saved 2m lesgoooo
I know. But like... I want harvest moon. not Rune Factory.
phantom, just look at all the fun youre having now
I mean yeah Rune Factory is good. But im simple. I dont wanna fight. I just wanna farm
now when the dab patch?
I've mainly liked RF more because I always just feel like the characters get more expanded upon since the stories typically get more fleshed out
Cause the combat is just pretty standard ARPG
Well they COULD have done that with harvest moon I feel. they just chose not to clintB and then RF happened
I am a non violent farmer
Yea the dungeon crawling being your progression I guess could be annoying if you don't want it but the farming dating sim is still def there
I personally ADORE Harvest Moon: Magical Melody
That's the only HM I currently own physically
story progression is important. Id rather not have to fight to get more story. I think that's my only issue
Thank goodness they got rid of the runey system. I hated that in RF frontier
Oh runeys were just there to pad shit
Frontier was ABSURDLY rushed
That game had a like 1 year dev time
The wii RF games are weird cause you either love them or you hate them
If Tides had farming I'd like it significantly more because it easily has to best ARPG aspects of the series
Frontier was my first RF game. I liked it until I didnt.
okay dipping out for real, GL
My first was 4
Then I played 3 and Raven existed and that's when the series was for me
I played HM for so long before RF I just am a diehard HM fan
I have an unopened 4 copy on my desk
I played A Wondeful Life, Another Wonderful Life, Mineral Town, More Friends in Mineral Town, Magical Melody, and a couple more
talk to mom and enter toilet
i just had breakfast :3 egg and bacon sandwich and some sunny d
i like making screwdrivers with sunny d
sounds like you need to do gregsp to get used to BN6 again
it's a good run
you can say you just forgot a wiggle
there's a good video tutorial for that movement
Neon white is rad as fuck so far
It's the platformer fps that got shown again the other day at whatever
With the devil people
Oop a buff00n character just showed up
Tall, red hair, gonna beat the shit outta me
how the fuck are you not done Kappa
sub 4 colonel axlsenS
naturally you'll blame sky g
I plan on watching in the morning when no one streams
you wanna do this again?
so it'll be a casual gregarious fight
I tried changing the title lmao
we take those W
how did trnarrw go?
prof is too good for us
well sure, it's no hackjack
nothing on the outside smh
I thought you were a gamer
did youbsee what I shared in music?
I can't get used to hearing Axl so often lol
where have you been LUL
It's not something to apologize for
I'm pretty vocal here
true, but when I am here...
chat, he feel for it!
bugs were such a cool concept
OH BABY A DOUBLE
have you been watching komari?
nah don't be a casual
hurry my lunch is about over
I will EAT a Fright Jar if this run doesn't get goombario. I will crack the lid with my teeth and suck out all of that sweet fright juice. Then, I'll insert the jar in my mouth and begin crunching. Once it has been reduced to several sharp chunks, I will unleash it into my unsuspecting stomach. After that, it's up to my doctor.
fuck his first message was a sub I can't ban him for that
Almost a year, thats crazy
I am genuinely considering just speedrunning neon white after I finish it
A game with mechanics I've loved to death and I've yet to even dislike a level
I've never had a movement game this crisp where it actually had levels I liked 100% of the time
The resource management with how fast you go and good times requires precise ass aiming it's just so fun
Cause your weapons are cards you pick up and they have sub abilities that remove the card entirely but help you move faster or break a barrier
Yea the game encourages you to find the optimal paths
And they made multiple ways to do a level
There's also gifts you collect that you can get after getting at least a silver medal on that level that're really fun to get
Most have made me find a way to smuggle my cards around to keep the most amount of abilities I can to reach them
After I 100% the game I'm def gonna at least do IL's for a bit
Yea a lot of the fast strats are very input intensive but also feels and looks very good
Like that last thing I tweeted took an hour of learning those flicks and I still was like a second off the wr
At least the FPS muscle memory helps with the flick part LUL
holy crap a coconut in a COCONUT tree
burn that tree down this instant
is it a missed sword? MissedASword
I want to get more emotes but I also need money for flights and tournaments
don't buy kooper he's evil
she's holding the turtle hostage
kooper was imprisoned there for public indecency
Kooper was put in prison so I'd believe that
What's the rules for the extreme shuffle?
using your timer for cake LUL
Jesse has to play shuton into dabuz tomorrow lmaooo
But yea other than gameplay Neon white has a cool concept
Jist of the plot is you're dead people who got sent to hell and you're brought to heaven to compete for a chance to stay there for a year by helping them clear out demons
Fuzzy stole koopers money LMAO
I really need to work on my colonel counters axlsenWut
when it goes good tho its such a clean fight
literally gives you a penny to do his job smh
I mean that's probably his own whole salary
Would make sense why he didn't give a shit and lost every letter
I had a really strong gut feeling about that one LOL
D: that pebble is for bowser
The one seed I did I got caught by a slow go trap
I am the only person who would be affected by that
No more Kooper nudes for free you gotta pay now
What would koopers name on OF be
Hey youtube viewers, comment below what you think koopers onlyfans name is
ok now make the title good so I get answers to that question
little flower dude just in the forest playin with they train
sub or die plupGun
click the funny red button
maybe the little bell too if you're feelin goofy
honestly if I want to watch a vod Ill just embed it in discord so no ads
the twitch stream that is
oh course if im subbed ill just watch it on the channel
I watch a lot of people and with how many tourneys I watch it's worth it
Cause FGC majors run on like 15 different twitches at once
xrd bracket I have on the other monitor just got a jam on screen
can things in shops be traps?
am sick in bed
please come end me
I was gonna say... spend 30 coins on a bomb :) i would be big mad
@permitzi I thought that "okay, good" was aimed at me for a sec
you may not like froyo but i would not wish sickness upon you because of that
so the ravens are called kyu-chan, prob named after the sound they make and raphael is called Big Kyu-chan LUL
Man Johnny looks mad annoying to fight but he's so cool to watch
I wanna play it
random question: bn5 colonel makes more sense as the "canonical" version than team Protoman, right
win some, lose some
thats right, if you play protoman you wont know colonel in 6
also falzar is the canon version due to tomahawk having unique lines to say to colonel
Megaman/Lan meet Colonel and Baryl for a cutscene apiece in ProtoMan, that's no where near enough time to recognize Baryl's in BN6 when he talks to Lan/Chaud
Baryl LITERALLY shows up after the final boss and Lan's like, "?
"I'm Baryl" oh okay. cool
who needs the pyramid stones when mario can just be stoned weedMario
Jam is back on my screen and I already want her gone why is she so loud
was megabomb worth getting for LP?
okay this shit made me laugh
mega rush is called "dangerous and powerful" LMAO
goombario been workin out!!
now we get the good cutscene
thanks game... got 3 capped on KP phase 2
just got seed from colorado and notice I forgot the one in forever forest lol
it's an official speedrun strat though
It's time for bloons gaming
I have like 300 hours in 6
he could have sushi up his ass
That's not an autograph that shit is just a graph
merlin is super fan!!!
ive never done that check cause i always forget it
and i think my body wants me to go to sleep
bro i was legit yawning playing pape tonight
its not just an axl thing/
you are dying irl this run if this keeps up
you need sushie for bowser castle
i want a money tree
is that allowed in glitchless?
i was like WAIT what
oh yeah got sub 1:40 random% td
isnt swimming on water tyronShock
Damn, missed most of the run. Lol
Lucky with the shocks Pog
learned that deflecting shit with my sword gives me a speedboost on top of killing things
Also learned there's a medal past the last one it actually rewards you for so I'm uh getting these now
Didn't even show it existing I didn't know it was there until I grinded that one level with the shotgun lol
So if you see red medals by the level select that means that person is a gamer
its 12:14 rn wym
My grandma chugged a Baja Blast
she loves it and is literally the only soda she finishes
I don't understand why tho
it's a Rando Randy sNeed
haven't used sNeed in a hot minute
go get a victory Baja Blast
lmao im so awkward thank god for joey
1:41:59 was like my pb 4 days ago so i bopped that easily
i was shocked it wasnt like a 1:43
the break made it feel a lot longer than it was
I finally memorized the forest
I saw dodge master
I had Henry sell storeroom key, pretty funny
fp is maybe good
couldn't you just take sushi in tunnels to ch 5?
oh you don't have bombette
That makes sense. Hopefully you get an early ultra stone
never thought of you to be the type to do challenge runs
5fp spiny surge? Oof
so it's a cursed seed
Hows the rando going
Whelp then its not going bad so thats good
make up the rules as we go LUL
And a 1fp power shock? Seed does not want you to use laki
Oh god you're clippying on him? God I love rando
Him being a trap is a mood
Can I as a maybe helpful question?
Did you check the ch5 shop?
I noticed the title and was curious
ahh yes clippy I have no idea how to do your trick
but you look like hell
oh im talking the trick XD
not you, you look fine XD
u going to double down right
Hello hello how goes the laki rando?
I was doing some glitchless rubs and was 3 minutes ahead and threw to final again lmao ended 8 seconds red phanto274Smile
Hella good run tho up until that @permitzi
Know! Hello permit7 yeah it was sick until it wasn't lmao
Naw it was like 12 hours ago
when is ir next big tourney
Haha right? I've been sleeping so it has felt even shorter to me
when is port priority
Well that just sounds poorly planned
Could use some work
That's probably the best potato ever
I love that jammin jelly and ultra shrooms are the money makers. I get hype when I see one lol
I had to go to goomba king to get boos portrait in one of my randos permitH
Was not the vibe
Just hit the block monkaS
Hitting blocks can be spooky tho clintCry
My boyfriend is making spaghetti shoosh4Cozy pasta pasta pasta
I'm so hype for spaghetti I don't think you understand phanto274Hype
Salad and sandwiches sound tasty
I also have pasta
Oh I'm gonna make an Ezekiel plushie
With my plushie making skills
Right? When can I order my Ezekiel?
Time to open an Etsy shop Kappa
But for real I actually do like making plushies and have been getting an itch to make paper Mario plushies
I've made a shiny driftloon plushie for my boyfriend. It turned out amazing. So I can def make some paper Mario plushies
Bow would be so easy
do you have a picture of the drifloon
Oo doing the 7 partners would be a sweet collections
Yeah! One sec. I would def wanna make all the partners
I have a shitton of pokemon plushies I needa see this
The 2 things I bought from combo breaker were a controller and a giant ass chikorita
at least its not parakarry wanting to give letters
mine was in the tree you hit four times after junior
I have a picture but no means to share It with you tacoguyy :)
I just woke up
I can do that
That looks so good!
YEAH right? No tutorial or anything
a plushie is a project
that was one of the first plushies i made with no pattern :3
i also made a majoras mask plushie
I might be mass producing ezekiels clintT could be in the works if i get off my lazy butt LUL
you can laki clip through the white wall part i thought clintT
like the same way you clip for fast flood
i think I saw that somewhere lol
yay best guy getting his cake
right best guy not living up to his names T_T
You don't have a based goomba companion to let you see for lantern ghost
I am the worst when it comes to marking things off the tracker. especially keys
lakilester giving you a snuggle
thats literally what it looked like
i wonder where cheeky lil parakarry is
maybe hes in the store phanto274Lurk I always forget to check it after I beat a star
the amount of times ive gone into desperation mode cause i forget to check that place SMH
chapter 1 kinda giving good stuff?
nope the game said THUNDER LUL
ok you saw that too
PerMitzi: nope the g
a 7 coin coupon
i could never leave it

this chapter's a mess
i see you obtained the trophy weight
it's not too late to turn around
there are people who care about you
yeah, i also got up like right away to get ready for bed ahaha
i prob woulda missed it anyway
spear guys are 70%, fuzzies are 75%, spike top 60%
a dink of all time
so that's how you do that
get into the pyramid without raisin' it up
Weed from the Flower Fields? You KNOW that's the good shit!
how is this laki only don't you need other partners for stuff
kooper has a twin
midnight and this fool still ain't done LUL
ain't midnight in his area
goombario only is like the buster only of pape KEKW
glad to see fight was worth
what do you need?
goom on deep nuts
auto corrected goom to derp
from the sounds of it, you don't wanna clear this seed
g9d I hat3 mobile
you have everything for 7?
phantom gets his just desserts
time to dip have fun gamer
I really should play smash before advantage state this time but like I dont wanna play wifi
But I lost because of input fuckups in both sets last time and it's a simple fix ughhh
Why cant bamco just make good online a single time
instead of playing Smash for Warp Zone, I've been playing Mario Kart for SNS
mega smash laki bowser
laki is fucking dead
what a way for laki to go out
and nobody is sad
GOODBYE, THIS GODAWFUL SEED

gl on the runs today
wanna see the ones I've made for him?
he has three emote artists
whomOk whomVwheel whomBall whomSip whomGG whomABall
i also made his channel points annnnddd alllll of his overlays
theres also holiday versions of those emotes
whomSip is my favorite holiday version
it has a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows and some steam coming off
he normally would stream a lot more in the summer but he got an internship this summer
honestly. this would be how i do snowslide whomDerp
ive taken and still am on a speedrunning break
the only streams I've done recently are art commissions ones
like the one imma do later
i have a clip of a mawhile that made deathline (the main mod at the time) just sigh and ask how
i never really got bad ma's to be honest
though my last run of any%, a race, i got SO MANY GOLD NUGGYS IN A ROW
it was a race against Rob for his series race, and he joked to say im going to get nugs since i was ahead
i got i think 4 or 5 nugs in a row
he felt so bad after the third
after the fifth. i really didn't wanna do the run anymore
and like i dont run with splits
splits give me too much anxiety
my last pb, my splits crashed. i only knew what time i got was because I was in a race with rob and furi and won so they told me
and in said run, i also was fixing whoms poke tracker for series race whomDerp
i really shouldn't have been able to pb
i would have to see
but you can do different colors on the one he uses
as long as you talk to balloon friend
i havent seen many lets go runs to be honest
i know some of the stuff
whats item sliding whomDerp
it depends on which item sliding it is
the one in meadows WASTES time
some of beach does save
this one is hit or miss
i think all item sliding is stupid
but who am i to talk
i refused to do a "faster" route because im determined to beat a certain person's time
and also i struggle to double dash
both the speed boost and the game
im bad at mario kart
yeah doesn't work for me
many people have tried to teach
it just doesn't work with my brain
whoms tried to teach me the visual cue, especially in person
i just can't gcjDed
i don't need a top time in this game. I've made me mark plently enough
park is just fun to randomly run
park 2 any% not fun. park 2 all friends is apparently where it's at
i was originally offered to be a park 2 mod, but i declined it since i never ran the game
i literally just had this convo with Mr Shasta the other day whomLUL " as a speedrun the first is more fun. as casual, the second is more fun. you dont really need to know nor play the first to understand the second"
the game is fun
if you actually want to know. the ONLY reason i even Speedrun Park 1 in the first place was a bet i had with Cheez. If i did a single run of Park 1, he would play park 2 casually
and cheez had fun playing park 2
i had a similar bet with whom
If i did a single PMD BRT run, he would play my favorite game, Okami, casually
this minigame is a nightmare
you couldve just ended the sentence there
pretty sure everyone does
I've had to redo several pokes before
just be happy you played all friends after it has become what it is today. running the game back when it was called hundo was a lot worse gcjDed
true hundo is a whole other beast
Hundo required every single pokemon in every attraction. that includes your legendaries
meaning you need to 99,999 metagross
and hit nearly every ring for Latias. you could only miss ONE SINGLE RAINBOW RING
i dont remember what i struggled for Latios. but both Latis gave me hella trouble
it's honestly because of me and whom that all friends is what it is
we ran hundo for about 3/4 weeks in a row on fridays
and slowly finding new things that we could remove
there was others. like Cheez, and Rob, and eve. lagging who joined
but it was always me and whom
All friends was the reason i got to affiliate in the first place. whom and cheez would finished before me and then raid me whomLUL
i know most people followed me for park
HA we do art now
when i feel like doing park, i do see an increase of people
i dont stream at all consistent
i take long breaks
I've gone months ope cinder23Oof
my main game is park, i try to learn okami on and off for years but life~
i was going to speedrun a game i backed on Kickstarter but.......i dont like the community
i don't like what they decided to do
they love me even though i cant get a run really going
Id say if you do really wanna do okami, okami is a.HUGE big hearted community
we even made a second discord called discount okami where it's us friends just hanging out and being goofy
whom never joined the og PSR discord because of a similar reason
i currently have am okami emote to do
hello fellow okami art enjoyer
theres an art event so ive just been lurking
we talking bout dogy?
life has just been in my way
i was going to learn again this summer but i got a ton of commissions and once i finish this last one, I'm closing them down because im taking a google certification class
I'm going to be a UX designer
i need to do comms too but i want to get personal stuff done ;-;
i already have my bachelor's of Graphic Design
UX is just the next step up
but makes 20-30k more base pay
and given I'm moving to Cali next year... yeah
i need that 20-30k more
ive been meaning to do some full landscape pieces this summer, i have a sketch of one for okami
my non artist friends sometimes get tired from me whomLUL
i forgot rotom sounded like that
why doesnt' it just go brrbrbrbr
furret is silly fren
that's a lot more hops than needed whomThink
you can dash onto those and hop up
yeah it's easier that way
you also don't need to hop the last platform for mews. you can just dash across
aka the platform right across mew
but yeah. in granite zone, those platforms you can dash hop. dash to those that are risen and then hop after
honestly just cry for togekiss
whom and i were able to do it as 2p1c
this game is interesting as 2p1c
I lost to steve and terry, def wifi
I think the mu is fine, I actually just got outplayed
whom did D-pad, B button, a button, and -. i did home, +, 1, 2
it's been a hot minute
not as complicated as you think
treehouse movement is dumb
i feel like you would know
Pikachu isnt good at any attra
Im talking about my bad engrish
Oh lord he comin
that's all I need to know
back after getting a +3 on my stash of Blast
I love hamtaro KPOPheart
why was that the master sword
What should I name this tapu fini
It's now named idk
Better than last time
last time I had to name something burp
I think it wants you to do chapter 2
Yo that star piece
yo this tapu fini
they also have a base 130 fairy move I think comes from the gear thing
but that's not as good
whatever the gear mythical's name is
Oh I have a pure power exploud as well

Yea he's 25 and gone to like a billion combo breakers
Malort has a special place in my liver
that's the first Ezekiel pasta that's in my storage
I'm sending that to buff00n
so why did buff00n say, "soon"?
I have no fucking clue
he's been at work all day
Oh it's not good. Don't get me wrong
Buff00n said "Ah, a man of culture"
I think buff00n misunderstood the screencap
DUDE THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
JESSE HAS REJECTED ALCOHOL
*insert image of Thanos with the text, "What was he cooking?"*
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT SHIT ASS
Cheer10 did someone say malort

if it's so easy why did that fight take 2 and a half hours LUL
I have a huge power pyroar in my pc
missing a seed? have you checked https://pm64randomizer.com/
It can't learn shit though
pyroar is one of those pokemon that i totally forgot existed until literally right now
It is a lame ass pokemon
I forget lovdisc exists
luvdisc is for heartscales only
that got rid of that in Gen 7
alomomomoolol is for terroizing lower tiers of singles
i can't unsee it
Every time I see them I think of jcog saying "What if they had nipples"
i'm trying to think of other pokemon that i forget about, but i couldn't come up with any :)
don't spend it all at one place
@starry_arie every Gen 8 mon ever
Centiskorch is great tho
i don't even remember the starters
oh now i remember them
Rillaboom fucks people a different way
I don't know them by the names
VGC people got PTSD
i tried to forget about inteleon because it's so ugly

phantom speaking different language
some people think it looks very good pepeW

Oh yeah. I fell asleep before she finished chapter 4 phanto274Smile i was a sleepy gorl
squirrel and moose bawkGasm

10.1k let's go :D
do you know where I can watch pools?
okay doesnt look like anyone is doing pools rn long as a catch the main events
finals are during the pape race. want to enter but not sure anymore
im done working sundays so you cant blame me for being excited about that
yeah, If I wanted to race I had to call in lol
yo? this man just try to hit a flying enemy with a hammer?! that is pape 101
Hello! How's the rando going?
Looks like it just got even better with that Mega Rush XD
And hes in the floor
Y'know I was gonna do the usual with pallos but he had a based message
we don't talk about goombario
Slippi is banned from pandas chat and people are mad
Why are you planning on downgrading your hp?
Almost like supporting pirating a game from the company you're working with is bad
"WOO MELEE GOOD NINTENDO BAD" -random twitch chat drone
So if you're at 1 HP you just become an unstoppable force
I was gonna buy and play FEW today but Idk if I particularly want to spend 60 rn
I just muted the # and I'm gonna wait
The power of the wario alt
A lovely chat message from plups chat "@plup can you unblock me on twitter im sorry for sending you farmer porn FeelsBadMan "
And yes I am mostly posting this here for the bot to pickup "I'm sorry for sending you farmer porn"
I'm disappointed his chat just hit the Analyze on that instead of copy pasta'ing it
he still has it but now it's at 20
@TacoGuyy I... Uh... What?
Man just liked some farmer porn and wanted to share it with his fav player
oh no bow has lost her's colours
I missed an interesting conversation while I went to get supper.
tbh thats pretty normal from top smash players chats
what happens if you don't use bow ability?
if you don't have bow mario just stands there
oh that's nice of from the game
That didnt hot the clubba?
Flushed hot clubba's in your area
So gourmet guy just needs some dirty talk to get on with it NOTED
Lemme send that to ohrocks
you don't need it?
oh I didn't hear that last part
this is fine, someone would've said it anyway :)
It's a hot topic
I hope it stops being straight forward, it is pride month afterall
fish goes in the ground
it's what they do
You about to got through the floor are you?
Oh no just land swimming my fav
this is normal fish behavior
swiming on the ground very normal
Damn bro you got the whole squad
Why is bombette the only one without a recolor
So far DBFZ players seem to be having a lot more fun at CEO since they banned labcoat
Games are faster and more team variety
Cause you remember the fucking 5 chars we saw at combo breaker LOL
I just hope this next patch destroys lab coat
That is a genuine problem char cause literally EVERYONE swapped to her in the team comp it wasn't a choice
Im guessing that there is still a lot of fusions and reg 21
Meanwhile Yonni lost to random hero from minnesota in pools with his broken top tier that needs to be banned tacogu1Sip
Yeah ssj4 can fuzzy you in a game that removed them lol
@TacoGuyy Wait I just saw this wut
Yea derpdog is a hero/steve player from MN lolll
he's the biggest shitter
I played him once, lost 2 games to steve, then shit on him in a reverse 3-0
How does a bomb kiss you
Yea some chars deserve it
Ult is not at that point
But steve is lame and I want him banned
Nobody dropping mains to play these fucks and they've one like 2 things without Leo lol
But yea I don't see steve ever fully taking over because the best players in the world play the swordies that beat steve lol
Yeah steve kinda gets fucked by the meta
Hes just better gnw
Punish game is stupid but also like that shit is frame perfect I feel like they deserve it if they hit it in bracket even if it's dumb
not the jab stuff tho
that stuff can go
It's snake levels of learning curve for matchup but it's def easier for steve to MU check it
What chars do you got where you are?
Wdym you have 4 bowser jr's why don't you want that
That's something I like about our current PR, the only low tier bitch is lucky
Your CB bracket was actually fucked
That was a jesse bracket
Was it like steve falco?
the 2 worst snake matchups
what do you do
ZSS before nerf was the only MU I was going to counterpick for wario
Its like zss is still top 5 or something
Now I can at least play oos game and poke her better
it would be cool if paper mario had new game plus :3
Even then I will likely try seph if it's bad
oo the best alt for CK
nice cap to save the turn lol
I was gonna stream but Idk if I really wanna rn
Cause the load at work was 6 hours late so I did the whole thing alone while closing
so Im not alive fully
we be going down the mountain today
block this and I'll gift a sub
STOP THEY ARE CHILDREN
Man let him playyyyyyyy
MARIO SAID FUCK THEM KIDS
HES GETTING WOBBLED IN HIS FAVORITE GAME
i would love a sub :3
if phantom didn't hate children you coulda got one
Yea I knew there was one in that room but I forgot which tree it was vanilla lol
i will get a sub one day
if he gets goombario that is also a sub
I just remembered that tomorrow is gonna suck for the wrong reasons
I don't like "for the wrong reasons" in that sentence
Last ep of love live is tomorrow and Im dreading LMAO
i need that sub!
one in my life i will let you get goombario
Also I was seeing that one of the upseted players was actually banned
But I think they are both mid
That man has brainwash-I mean convinced me
is there a way to see where parthners are?
Only if he gave someone the log
Also I play brawler so now so I believe him more
And by play I mean conuterpick him on yoshis
My yoshis char is falco
No just in general
Falco genuinely plays the game better on yoshis besides the plats so it works better than most peoples marios
I use brawler against zss because he does better than rosa and incin\
I don't mind it but my practice partner is falco so
Im happy that lylat is legal at the panda cup
In my game 5 set with zubat on wednesday (current 6th for the state) we just didn't ban and stayed ps2 and it saved so much fucking time
Cause it was sheik wario neither of us really wanted to go anywhere else
Im getting more accustomed to just going ps2 for every set
It just feels right
Unless they dont ban yosh's
Jaemi doesn't start PS2 because I've won literally 90% of our bracket games on it
Thats a cute plant
Yes I mean lilly
And he usually bans it in the regular bans
Oh I didnt know that
if it's 2 bans he just removes SV and he has never let me go to kalos a single time in my life
Dude the sonic player keeps letting me go to kalos
and I am very fine with it
Wario literally never fucking dies in that MU on that stage
and I just wait for waft
goml's stagelist is so good
come on goombario where are you
What if lacky is in your chosen partner when that cutscene activates
DoubleDown is doing crewbattles between NA, Mexico, EU, and JP
How hard will mexico win
I think NA gets last, EU is weaker but NA has sucked in literally every damn crewbattle ever
and game over for him
To the point of TK being an advocate for stopping NA being the main crewbattle candidate lolll
where to next phantom?
Did buff00n dm you about mwsf btw
He's thinking about driving up
He's figuring out work rn but he wants to
so I'm gonna wait to pay you for the room until we know if he's coming lol
cause that like cuts a bit out
I already have dibs on the couch/chair thing so Im fine
The nice thing if he does tho
We'll have a car
And there is portillos up there
we could also hit the friday local if the game schedule allows depending on what you and glenn get
I'm surprised with how many double ups they gave players
list of the games?
I have a link 1 sec
wait that's a page
Like I'll gladly not have to play WW but surprised they didn't accept a zelda and accepted those lol
Neopets is gonna be lit
how are they doing amy in sonic mania?
I love 2D sonic, im playing it right now LUL
well gl i will go play with a friend
they did this same shit with sonic 06
Frontiers is gonna be ASS
the only good game sonic was in was smash ultimate LUL
he killed a master hand in subspace that was rad
I picked a time to tune in
oh buff00n I mentioned your maybe coming to midwestspeedfest
just let us know as soon as you can about if work lets you or not
I'll send that thread to you one sec
they fixed colors so I feel like this will get fixed eventually
It's the last thing phantom sent me so I have it right there lol
Sega continues to rush Sonic out the door despite DECADES of evidence saying they shouldn't
open source game engine LUL
that's the only aspect of sonics speed they understand
So a joker player in MN said steve was so easy to win with that a baby could do it and now he's playing steve today
and he losing to 0-2 metaknight
at least fans will patch the PC version
Oop he swapped to joker
I played him a few weeks ago
I shit on him very badly
Considering how much positive buzz is around Sonic due to the movies, it's incredible how quickly Sega's moving to stomp out all that goodwill
I hit a raw fsmash just because I understood
TWO fx badges? blessed seed phanto274Bless
His joker got 2 stocked
Also was informed this is the same MK player from "the incident"
I need to find this clip it's very important
god who fucking posted the clip I dont remember
where was pulse stone?
smash pools are over, pandacup had them
what does repel gel taste like?
at least he tips, I guess
I can't figure out who posted the clip
they didn't name drop in the tweet itself either so searching is a pain
it'd MK, was it Bear?
did you say "taste like dicks?" Kappa
you know damn well I don't keep up with Smash shit
also, it's "MK", that means either "Mario Kart" or "Mortal Kombat" in my noggin
Phantom, tell TacoGuyy to stop being mean to me
Grown ass man can't handle me shittalking him
Took 100 bucks from him with falco he hasn't recovered
I got mitzi to agree to coach/backseat for my first glitchless run. Just have to find a date LUL
Ok I found the clip of the incident but it's an edited repost
gonna be so much fun
I'll dm it to you for after stream, that's the MK that the joker lost to LUL
what ETA for the marathon run?
ooo apologyman made it to top 96 at ceo with faust
The char is actually a character now
Scarecrow actually functions as a teleport mix option now like door did
that jump is so ridiculous that it works lol
Scarecrow prc throw is absurdly hard to deal with
I'm glad I'm millia and just fly away
i think i saw you do laki jump with it too right?
oh that clippy thing?
Oh now it's time to watch pplant megaman
yeah there's things i feel like i'm not at skill level yet, that's definitely one of them LUL
MAKE SURE HE'S REAL
before I rng gift who want
speak now or forever not be able to phanto274Mash
@Axl_Sensei I don't think so lemme just get to 40 lol

was watching a casual TTYD stream and got a notif
Goombario has blessed you
Haha took numer one slot for axl

I don't appreciate the goombario diss but yw
goombario is beautiful and perfect

how/why the fuck did I get a Switch friend request through Sonic Origins????
why is megaman dair +1
why does he get that
we'll get some info
goombario tips 'n' tricks

34 is bowsers favorite number after he got that funny pink crown
Taco where is the sub
I called for it earlier

Haha taco is too kind it's my first time here plus I never ask for stuff

shutting off my Switch in disgust
PokePark title theme catJAM
@buff00n look at the retweet

This opening also has chikorita so

Thunderbolt? Can you run out of PP?

sound's nice for the pokemon's
phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES

IM HERE FOR A POKEPARK STREAM PogChamp
Yeah I tied WR last night so I'm trying to break the tie LUL
But hows your stream been?
Yeah idk if they're gonna compare miliseconds so
I'm think I'll just save up for VIP LUL
So what were you doing before this?
Oh yeah quick side thing, have you thought stuff you've wanted to test for dog island... I'm making a list of stuff to try whenever I go back to the game
Yeah I've been think about some ideas. Also maybe testing things on PS2 since I have that on emu
Yeah the conditionals for the game seem pretty strict
There's no way to tell them apart expect talking LMAOOO
Oh yeah have you ever like experienced lag on any version of dog island?
Wow that's nuts LUL
Wait when does timer for dog island usually start?
Oh that changed too? Interesting
I knew about the ending
but not the starting one
I am so sad
are the loads different on each version or not really?
I had to leave a stray cat alone on my walk and I might have started balling lol
I wonder what they would be if you like did USB loader thru homebrew
Im gonna go back for him tomorrow morning
probably not allowed tho
Ok good to know
I've been thinking about it, I was talking about stuff with a viewer and got me interested again
I hated that chase as a kid
I'm gonna head out now gl with the run
huff is a rager
yeah ima do a lot
do you have enough timesave here to pb?
Electrode already shaves off half
Oh wait you are in granite nvm lol
don't talk to electrode
Yeah you can kinda just buffer every input
hey corsay guess what
that isnt the game you are playing wym
NOW you are understanding yhe struggle
Yeah the movement has been pretty solid it definitely wouldve golded
Youll be saving a good like 20 secs all around though when you get consistent at double dash
Your mashing and menuing is getting really good
Random question real quick
do you know the language versions in dog island
I'm just looking thru some files and I'm finding interesting things
There are appearently six different languages
but whats weird is i got these files from NTSC
also there are two files called home button?
there is french, german, italian, netherlands, and spain
Yeah thats what I'm just doing lol
phantom rq its 15 friends out of meadow right
yeah im counting autos
yeah im preparing notes and learning the route over time
real men throw on mew chase for the catJAM
MEWMEWMEW MEWMEWMEW MEWMEWMEW MEWMEWMEW

YO ive been up since like 4 am. I might be on a sorta normal sleep schedule now
everyone in phantoms chat MUST be subbed
just a couple days more and i'll go full cycle back to normal sleep scedule
cats4eWiggle cats has some really cute ones
tho i do sleep for like 13 hours a day
it's really a toss up
hi it's been awhile
cats4eWiggle Axl has allowed me to wiggle now
cool emote wish i could use it
Mitzi is my wiggle buddy cats4eWiggle
coincidentally I am also doing a Rando Randy sNeed in Pok'mon Platinum... just need to figure out how I want the catch rate to be
ok im gonna go be horizontal now. For how long? I have no idea but I shall be a lurkin Bedge
oh phantom, there were 2 people to race on sunday. I was waiting on more to join but no one else joined and the 2 dropped out so I watched CEO instead KEKW
what was that sparkling thing
ive got the previous week's seed and one from mitzi, just need to find time for them
Its getting ready to rain so its nice and cool outside so took pupper on 2 laps around my community
what timezone are you?
I never done a randomizer before
I used to have super pape, enjoyed it but got bored replaying it. Just found a $15 copy on ebay. Asking seller for pics of the disc.
its the only pape game I dont own
cats running it has me curious again
first day on new job i had enough downtime to watch all of castlevania advance lol
ive never played a cv
poor komari, begging everyone to do commentary LMAO
was it meme worthy?
komari over here doing gods work
My starter choices are Scizor, Golduck, or Feebas
you know, I wouldnt be surprised if we did have a big direct planned then after all the leaks nintendos like "fuck this! Have a partner showcase you plebs"
Feebas would be pretty funny as a first nuzlocke choice
I love that im off on nights so I can watch streams like yours and cats rn
it was only for 9 months so it wasnt for that long
nah, it was 8am - done KEKW
Next Jan will be 10 years since I made my twitch account lol
first 3 people I followed was terra, ero, and kilios
ero went by method1cal, but dont tell anyone I told you that fifiBad
back when he ran bn4 LMAO
yeah, actually the teambn marathons would raise for charity. Protodude tweeted out the event and thats how I found everyone.
thats also how I found twitch
I wish I had repel gel irl to repel all the haters.
Does Repel gel work on bad RNG?
it technically would considering that you avoid the bad stuff but not the slow stuff
did you watch links awakening?
there were several points where both streams were damn mirrors
I was doing other stuff too so wasnt as focused on it as Id like
joke was too funny not to cliip
and the secret of dry dry ruin's will be a secret
I just saw this comment in rando discord
your tracker updates automatically to highlight what checks are available!?!?!?
mario just walking underground don't mind me
Just need the tts to say that
I had ENOUGH after month 1
can't wait for 69 months
when i got money i will get sub or just wait til i get gifted
drink a baja blast
would be fun if you could use the pan as a weapon
baby seed 1fp megabomb
hey taco he has your fav parther goombario
What was he cooking?
I'm glad you thought the same thing ohrocks
thanos appeared in my head
what was buff00n cooking?
I just like that like
He never said anything else there
He just decided "oh well"
Taco want to learn feint attack?
if I have something to remove do it
you have Bullet Punch, Leer, Focus Energy, and Quick Attack
No move rando? tacogu1Bruh
I have TMs and Tutors rando'd as well as move learn pools.
if you failed that minigame it would've made my sub a whole 19 months too many
When I say "good luck" what im actually saying is, Hey, I hope you enjoy my streams and give me a follow and maybe even sub ProgChamp
@TacoGuyy what does the catch rate setting do?
normalizes catch rates across the board
So legendaries aren't a 2%
I always run it on mid so I don't lose my fucking sanity
Cause then legendaries would just become a lost encounter
And with rando, anything can die somehow so I don't care if it's easy to get shit lol
okay cause I'm still thinking about what it did
but you hate poekmon randos
That's why I have my masochist settings
And also do it sparingly
Cause I'm just playing through the same game except it wants to murder me
how do you know it wont be fun a second time Kappa
Although with pokemon no matter what game I play with or without rando will overall be the same videogame lol
I never did get around to watch that vod
At least Rando makes me feel fear
I was about to start it but mitzi went live. Live content always beats vods
how fast will phantom do this boss
alright first encounter is a nincada
will battle network be in the direct tomorrow?
watch them have a megaman skin in monster hunter and you have to pay up LMAO
wait if I get shedninja from Nincada would that be considered a new encounter or a freebie?
Bass in mon hun would be cool tho
is 100 pit a legit thing or is it just a meme run at this point?
if I ever do pit Im titling my stream "I hate myself" that goes for golden pigs too
also work approved my time off for mwsf glennj5VIBE
bot spewing garbo rn
yo, I just heard from a leaker that GTA6 will be in the direct Kappa
i'm ready for people to be mad about the direct
What time even is it on wednesday
yea I'm not waking up for it
I will watch it after
I mean the YT video will have timestamps in comments
So I will just look at that
it never was stickshamGaslight
that's like the first time glenn has done that
I'm proud of him
glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!!!
yeah cause you got banned lmao
this is why I say I need repel gel
They were really into the story he was telling them.
Paper Mario: ace attorney
it's been a while since I typed that emote
should've grabbed that Mystery smh
omg ubisoft leaked a release date for their own game LUL
Mario + Rabbids, im excited for it
we still havent seen any game play yet

glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS
that star piece is more special than you think
it came from gourmet guy
thinking about M+R has me thinking about a Splatoon Xcom
im gonna start getting ready for bed, thanks for the stream. Wanna get sleep schedule on track
yeah its gonna take some time lol
do the yoshi's deserve to be saved?
JYankee's Nincada has almost died 3 times to poison to wild pokemon
he wanted it named Sir Brapington
I'll never understand the mind of one named the JYankee
Plant is also a cherubi that will be a cherrim
"worst sNeed" has 1 FP Mega Bomb
today I learned that nincada is ground part
I didn't notice since I'm speeding up my grinding
Oof missed the run again! FeelsBadMan
we love a gamba
he just saved you from 3 caps
sub 3:20 still seems nutty for that seed
Alright, now do another one Kappa
7 hour run? woof
he is simply too cool for your chat window
you cannot handle his raw rad energy
i literally have not looked at or touched this game since it came out
this is gonna be some nostalgia
Give us park 3
Just give me a park game with shuckle
How long is park 2 all friends
I figure it'd be shorter cause less waggle
Maybe I'd join that depending when you did it
LOL just running right past the berry
this is gonna be good
fuck your blood money, chatot
going left cause you ain't treatin me right
"Del taco" thank you captions
captions are so good
I'm so glad panda cup had captions
Like it's just nice to have and also very funny sometimes
according to the captions: "Captions on Twitter so good."
I need to add them but I like keep forgetting to because I dont stream
The art is good
I had no idea you could post in that channel but I approve
Oh wait megaman isn't coming until next year lol
Nintendo just tweeted "next year"
I didn't watch the thing so I have no idea of dates LUL
Only saw the end from coney
So I saw the 'not rune factory'
643 sounds like a very irritating motion input
I hate 64 inputs
I'm glad I don't play any chars with them in anything
There's a few in blazblue that have them so I just refuse to play those chars
I mean like 646's and things like that
yea just back and forth inputs
Charge I hate but I can get over
just find them 4Head
if only you used my magnificent notes that have never been wrong
If there is loading screens I am always fiddling with something
I just fiddle with shit very quickly so I did it with windwaker constantly loll
there is only one game I can think of with a 753 input
There's a char in arcana heart that makes you draw a star and you have to do the directions perfectly for it
I should prolly like warmup smash at all today
I guess I should just play park or ttyd according to the bot fuck smash
But like I've gotten good enough results where to good people want to practice with me now
So it's actually fun before bracket
how is it going

go on the right of the bridge
if youarent dead middle you should be able to avoid it
grass type go brr
just use iron tail
I see people complaining the exe collection is just a pile of rooms, but to me it's still more effort than 3d all stars LUL
the art is neat
Galaxy was done very well I wish sunshine also was
I have complete works art book and music is on Spotify but cool to have I guess
the emulation bugs made it optimal for a little bit lolll
Cause it had the goop clearing bug where you didn't actually have to clear the *** on the hotel
That's how I feel about WW on switch if that ever happens
oh of course not
gyro controller go brr
switch WW at worst will patch out ESS bugs and at best will just have no cutscene skips and be 10 minutes slower in every cat
worse map and item ui tho
wii u ui goated
nothing beats a whole nother screen
yeah I totally feel that. since I got my everdrive switch online was never an option
phantom when we doing odyssey hide and seek
also with raphnet I can remap my buttons, something nintendo won't let us do
has it gone up or down in your eyes after enduring the speedrun?
sup nerd, how are you?
he is a nerd truuu
the only reason I'd play the bn collection is for ps trophies
@Glennjaamin all speedrunners are nerds, I'd know I am one
think that would be fun
what you run then counter nerd
love me some ps trophies
Octodad and Let's Tap, mostly
I'm assuming you've never heard of Let's Tap
if i google it i will
pokemon let's tap eevee LUL
it's a wii game controlled by cardboard box
Let's Tap is a video game developed by Yuji Naka's studio Prope and published by Sega for the Wii console. Along with Let's Catch, Let's Tap was the first game from Prope to be announced. Owners of Let's Tap can unlock content in Let's Catch. The game was later released as five individual applications for iOS.
@Axl_Sensei *insert vaporeon pasta here*
I found you through Speedromizer, you've probably heard of me talking about it there
i should do speedromizer but ugh
pls don't poison phantoms pure chat
links awakening was ROUGH last time
it deserves meme status, I just wish more than 6 people were in on the joke
you couldve just bopped em in
you heccin tbolted wym
why mash when you can tap fifiBad
speedrun is rough, game is fun but without breaks it's painful after a bit
me after my 2nd mario ddr run in a day
i gotta see what switch games i can do with the ddr pad tbh
A B and Z fourthgenKEK
i can always remap too
why can joker do fair 1 > fair 1 > fair 1 > arsene dair from a ps2 plat and murder someone at mid%
nah i got some booky hand me down
beat up on corphish, all of them are now your friends
can we do some pm rando today?
wtf is joker fair
I can do fair 1 > fair 1 > fair 1 > fair 1> dsmash at 60
and you can't DI the landing ones
Jaemi is playing joker now with falco and I don't like it
Leo was playing joker with gluto last week and it gave me hope
Then he did a corrin run the weekend after
remember kids - if you want to make friends, beat them up!
it's ok, all corphish are your friends
"I want you to prove the message is from Blazakin!" "alright, how should I do that?" "win a race"
wait, even worse - "convince someone else to win a race"
...how does he slide? Shouldn't he either hover or roll?
random, but I really think Splash should be able to 1 hit KO with like a 5% hit chance - Magikarp is capable of jumping a mountain, so he just hit the opponent with that jump
all the other 1 hit moves are at 30% anyways, so it's extra useless
just not "do nothing" useless anymore
z splash was +3 attack, closest thing to useful it got
"He's using extreme speed!" "What's extreme speed?" "it's when his speed goes to the extreme!"
did he say his "mime cart"?
it's not : )
i was trying to put a smile in text format but I got that instead
mod the game so whenever pikachu bonks someone he just shouts "EY I'M WALKIN 'ERE"
that would be illegal, but hilarious
how did Magnemite get themselves stuck in box? what a bozo.
Park community vote to legalize the newyorker pikachu mod
ok time to pack up for advantage state gl
Get that W Taco!
I'm getting better than 7th this time just watch
we gonna get that PR win
otherwise you won't be getting on the W wheel
the question is, how did Snorlax not notice?
you'd think it would be poking him in the back
so the dance pad "works"
and by works means it always holds down right and b while plugged in
even i don't have the patience for this
on gc its fine but it no likes switch
I have the wr for park 2 yeah
but do you really
lol looking forward to it
all friends is the superios category
Nah it's pretty free on all of them
lemme just remind you rq
phanpy gonna be the grainte zone runback Kappa
Hope you're fine with some rng though, if you're gonna run park 2 AF
phantom past the point of worrying about rng by now
Well that's good then lol
There's only really one thing that i find annoying at this point which is the melody box
You don't get that many opportunities to pick one up during the run and if you have some bad luck it can cost you a stupid amount of time
thats fair. ive also been busy with life stuff and such so ive havent even touched it in weeks sadly
thats good at least
BRB making a rando vid
ive got my vods saved, might as well throw'em up
Buy followers, primes and viewers on mystrm .store
I never really did a Pikmin run, should probably do that soon
i just gotta learn some stuff about the last area
that's so dank i love it
aw, this minigame hates you too
I could probably do 7 days in pikmin now that i think about it
which is like top 10 for wii lol
It's just that one gate in forest of hope that is awful
It's submerged in water and you have to do it without blue pikmin, which means throwing bombrocks at a really specific spot
pokemon getting in the way is the funniest shit
pfft ok that's funny
"defeating me will not be easy" says the farfetch'd
man i love when you get to fight next to hydreigon in park 2
He's always angry which means he'll attack the pokemon you're attacking as well
or you if you're particularly unlicky
Granite Zone here we come kaybee9Pog
What was the chance of this again?
Ahh yes, Gamblers Falacy
on the money man
didn't whom have to reset once cause he got 4 gold nuggets in a row or something lmao
I gotta find the clip i'm thinking of
pape gless or rando?
i mean, with park 1 you couldn't glitch the game if you tried
I do hope they make a Pok'park for Switch sometime, One can dream atleast... I feel like having two joycons could open up more attractions aswell instead of just a single Wii Remote
Or i guess there is that possible Snorlax skip but idk what happened to that
Apparently there is a very small area where the wall isn't completely connected and someone alledgedly managed to squeeze through with a turnaround thunderbolt in the air
@Chr33T what section you chatting about?
I'll have to check with Brady on that one cause i believe he knows the guy
It's nice that you always know where people are hiding in park 2
there are 3 different spots but they will literally tell you where it is
skuntank got fucked LOL
oh wow i found a clip of Wh0m seeing a pikaclip for the first time lmao, didn't know there was one
I'm glad it's actually useful in all friends, it makes it so much more fun
Oh yeah, that happens a lot
especially unawarehouse is just awful
and windmill way too kinda, cause for some reason when whimsicott is happy she starts beating you up
Unfortunate you don't have a Tepig in this game for this smh
Snivy for doing almost everything else
I like the play "play elite smash" redeem
i'd say that's a fair price
I can't with the movement in this game, Pikachu just can't turn at all
I have previously likened him to a crossatlantic steamboat
Gliscor just stalling the timer, As per usual
I don't like any of the fights in general, you might see why i don't run this game
Yeah i don't get how Zach can play any%
He just has Gigachad energy i suppose
Wii Safety Strap the meta?
Then you can pull full 360' rotations during Bulbasaur and Dusknoir
attempting all friends already?
i just got home from work
my brain is gone
i see you tried the dash hop now
dash hop dash hop dash hop
let's see if run blessed
pz. give us your blessing
what a perfect time for the stream to bluff
max dash is something
it's actually why i can't do runs right after each other
the speed throws me off
double dash is the same speed
if you said anything to me in the last couple minutes, I didn't hear it I got a phone call
honestly. i hate flys chase the most
park has really wild invisible walls
this was the worst in true hundo
whom was so annoyed at Lucario during true hundo
as well as nearly everyone else but whom got it worse
but as long as it beats cheezs
oh i meant Cheez's any%
cheez actually has a faster all friends than me i think
piplup would get wr ez with that speed
alright. i got google class to do
Cavern zone is crazy fast if you get bastiodon bonuses done consistently
messing up even one high point hit loses like 6 secs
also what made you want to do another all friends lol
i dont know if a run like this is marathon worthy
just 2 hand that bad boi
ninetails so fast wtf
im telling yhou 2 hands is going to be easier
how tf do you shake and press 2 with one hand
you are the only person ik who uses 1 hand
that pokemon looks familiar
you dont need to shake fast at all in the attraction
makes pressing 2 easier
i would never 1 hand absol's attraction
go at a more brisk pace
hiiii holy crap that's a long run
I mean I do watch AO runs when I can, they are fun to watch
AO = alpha omega
^so if I click the follow button, I unfollow....I don't think the bot wants that
there all alternate time-lines
dont get me started on modern warriors games please i beg you
hell yeah, sounds like a good time
yup! it was good!
my brother came up for my birthday today and apparently he's here so i was like "oh i gotta go" LUL
ty! gonna do a lil lurk while we eat haha brb
dont you love it
this ones got the best music so far
handling your wii with 2 hands Flushed
at work. tryin to lurk
audio only, screen off
did parakarry hit a smoke with Mario?
buff00n can't see me
what's the warehouse key unlock again?
do me a favor, if TacoGuyy speaks up, call him a bitch for me
advantage state was run so poorly last night
Hello! gl on the rando spaget3Wave
I waited over an hour for my r2 because they decided to add more people after the cap mid bracket
and I had to play on multiple tv's
whats that blue star?
happy heart could save your life
enough letters for parakarry (FAKE)
what a bizarre sNeed
I will get everyone to say sNeed over seed
I'm playing fox again
this char is not ok
no character is ok
cause they're not goombario
My back airs are killing I can't believe light lied to me
is the randomizer even more random
1 HP is good though
gdqLemons gdqLemons gdqLemons gdqLemons gdqLemons
@Ohrocks glennj5CRY glennj5CRY glennj5CRY phanto274Bless
I will now prosNeed to make food and freeze Baja Blast cause I hungy
I need to send you how this last game with jaemi ended LOL
My chair is terrible but if I buy one I want a comfy one
and they're fucking expensive
Mine is from someones curb
ok recording this replay brb quick cause don't want the audio to bleed into it
Ok so if I just disable preview I guess obs doesn't blue screen when I close it?
I'm too lazy to switch back to streamlabs so hopefully this is consistent lol
mine crashes even with preview disabled :/
worth a shot for sures
Sent you the clip, it's like 5 seconds
Even Kels is doomer about sonic frontiers
She literally called sonic her older brother on his anniv if anyone would have hope for this game it's her
What's up with the updates?
Is a ghost party member not useable in battle?
one day my LP skip will be that fast
boss is what, 22/24 and then 4 16s?
you get xp from the bills on the cannon fight yeah?
Tuned into the xseed stream and holy shit
RF5 looks really good when it's actually running
so what are the new updates
I assume you can if usable partners before you have them is enabled
because that's an option
the blast isn't frozen yet unfortunately
if you find goombario on the floor during MWSF you're leaving him there right?
how cool is it that we're getting a battle network collection!
I've only played the first and second one, so im excited to play through the rest
wow I've played 1 like 5 times lmao
I like it gerbieRip
But I also dont know any better cuz havent played the rest
dang I didnt even know they were on wiiu
You wouldn't BELIEVE where I had to check this seed
Gotta seed it to believe it
red arrow pointing to magic seed
I'm turning on the wii u
I'm gonna PB after not turning this console on for 4+ months
I'm starting as soon as this vhs watching stream I have up ends
Debating on just not using the twitch category though
Cause it gets views but like I don't want those views
is it faster to do the climb back down or homeward since it's in the sewer
are the seeds the only things you're still missing
does a fortress key unlock any checks
ok my only warmup is 3 tricks
and I did them all first try
That's honestly why I like don't really wanna fully quit despite not wanting to be around the community
Like I put too much time in and got good at this run I don't want to just throw it away fully
wait I should do greatfish swim before I actually do anything
I got it first try I hate it here
It's harder outside of the segment too because the cycle is consistent after the cutscene
ok time to go shit quick then I'll play a shit game
do you have P-up on?
in the most backwards way
25% chance to not heal 0% of the time
Bear's gonna kick me out so he can stream within the hour
you like funny stuff right?
was playing bn5 mashing select to skip cutscene and did a soft reset
i just finished drill2
that was annoying so i came here lol
did you make that
i never beat this game lmao
i never beat it either
and forgor what to do
im talented i know
mitzi are you a pikachu or eevee fan?
looks like you need to practice KEKW
i swear by single joy con
no worse than trnarrw
i love resetting 20 minutes in
Pikachu being viable? unheard of
this isnt battle network you dont have to rub your face against the wall LUL
Xbox 360 was peak controller
did xbox ever have notches?
playstation didn't have them either
FUCK that 360 dpad
what the N icon on the top of your screen?
there was only one model of 360 controller that had a switchable Dpad
we're talking an entire console that died cause you made the decision to buy the damn thing
you can have 360 Dpad or a normal Dpad
next to the switch battery percentage
them having an intentionally fucked up stick doesn't surprise me
I thought that was an N
never seen that on my switch before
hey at least you can abuse that 360 controller and nothing would happen
an Xbox One controller can't even take an inch of floor drop-age
I'm sad there were never any Baja Blast controllers
someone started a fight with me over twitter saying the series controllers are better than dual sense. Told him to go touch grass LUL
Series Controller is a Xbox One controller but with 360 Dpad again
its bad cause a and b are swapped
there have been times where I thought of getting a series S then I remember I dont like xbox controllers
Dual Sense is honestly silly to me cause Sony just said, "yeah people won't complain about this control change and force everyone to use this"
bonk this rat for not having good Sp. Attack
eating a fruit by the foot and remembered when dk64 came out they printed tips on the labels
you needed all the tips for that game lol
I was that kid who rolled up the fruit strip into a ball then ate it all
at school we each had a notebook and we copied each others tips KEKW
Taco retweeted a cool Wario fact
smash ultimate has 1068 songs and not a single one is from wario land
Wario Land doesn't exist anymore
everything is hand drawn
it was a pain in the ass for the studio who drew literally everything in the game, but it was pretty af
good feel hasnt done any nintendo stuff since crafted world
wooly world to crafted world felt quick
retro is just a back up studio
welcome to mt moon
official playstation tweeted about battle network... what is this timeline?!
yeah, its just wild to me
based off the text font, I'm assuming it's gonna be re-translated
that text on the trailer is just an overlay, its not part of the game
will they really re-release BN4 as that trainwreck of the translation it originally was
its just a bunch of casuals talking
the extra bn5 content is on DS
I'd hope we would considering this thing's not releasing until 2023
im cool with less comps to explore
the games are filled with content already
can I at LEAST do local netbattles
guess I'm not getting it
i hope it doesnt have online, it would be hard to find people to trade with on PS
its not the bare minimum, they are adding a filter Kappa
but damn, HUGE missed opportunity if it's treated like virtual console releases
someone went to AX cosplaying as the "Blue Eyes White Drag Queen" LMFAO
no drag like an okama
its like everyone forgot about pape races lol
it's ok axl if everyone stops doing randos we can just co op one every sunday or race eachother instead
I feel like there is a lot of rng with pokemon runs
hey streamer, wanna trade pokemon?
one time ryan brought that up so I came in it your stream "hey streamer, wanna trade battle chips?" KEKW
i havent watched in a hot minute
ive played 3 scenarios was fun but thats all ive done
whats your favorite spin off pokemon game?
first one that comes to find for me is pokken DX
it has quite a bit of polish which is weird for pokemon
I didnt really like conquest
yeah, never finished it
i liked it more than mystery dungeon. MD is just not for me I have tried
I tried the first one and the switch demo fat nope
then theres rumble LUL
i dont like open world either, played botw for 40 hours and felt ive seen everything it has
but I can get behind xenoblade
"tango supports bn1" then mars replies, "but it shouldnt" KEKW
this is a the game where you can have 10 hero swords in your folder
@Axl_Sensei then they decided that you can have 4 full customs in a folder for BN2
you can have 5 assuming you can find them
alo i find it funny
"fullcust? no one will use this!! Make its reg 10 mb"
bn3 they made it a megachip with 50mb
*splatters 200 bugs with their car, blood and guts everywhere* Local North Dakota resident: Did you hit a deer? "I speedrun Hollow Knight"
once I get some extra funds I wanna commission aixi to do a bn piece for me. a 4 piece of acdc town in a diamond shape when put togther
its okay, google doesnt know either LUL
Jozedenjoljonerez & Korean Toys & Kiro PJ Masks Toys & Jeri Mahlersaver
"sorry we cant understand you"
I swear, pokemon can attract people from all around the world LUL
be careful, the bot might learn what you're saying
russian? google said serbian!
phones get thinner and smarter and im sitting here getting fatter and dumber
what is considered cute?
are we doing pokemon contests?
dratini's japanese name is literally miniryu
are we throwing now?
you can fight blue?
that wasnt in the original games
never played this far either
I only practiced to the end of rock tunnel
might wanna get a better starmie
if thats blue then what do they call the female trainer?
this part of the run is like new content for me
i hope jcog comes back soon
i was asleep and missed it
with bug fables I killed the spider on hard mode, was so proud
yeah, im waiting til I get home and get it on ps5
ive played enough to know ill enjoy it
JACK IN POKEMON TRAINER EXECUTE!!
wartab improved wr on xy
one played them at release?
i just learned something I will never forget
The voice of Higsby from the english dub did the voice of bling bling boy from johnny test. This is so cursed!!
I loved johhny test as a kid, it was a guilty pleasure
pikachu just wants to be fabulous
need more of this cats4eWiggle
i fail to put into words why I love that so much
ill be back later
i should've had a like 3:10 rando yesterday but i got soft locked and lost a bunch of time
it was quick. gl on this

Big D is in top 4 for goml
I just got home from work
Aaron counterpicked aegis and still got shit on judging by the setcount lol
He has to play Cosmos to get to LF
If big D beats this matchup he is just the best player in the world honestly
Grands has the combo breaker steve
Also why the fuck is coney there
but they put max on top 8 mic
TK can only carry so much
Ok cosmos is 30 seconds in and already playing this matchup wrong
he got to 100 immediately lol
oop nana killed him
nana AI is the only thing holding big D back
didn't they fucking buff that at one point too
She still leaves you offstage
big d won game 1
Cosmos is playing mythra the whole time here for some reason
He is getting punished on hit instead of playing fire ike
Nana died and the crowd is just chanting sopo
he is out neutraling aegis with sopo
Wtf is this desync
He's making nana dash upsmash alone and covering her after
Cosmos got 2 stocked
Tell her she's a nerd
@TacoGuyy knives says you're not allowed in her house
Does she pay the mortgage
She has no power
She prolly lives under the stairs
Big d is about to 3-0 this nerd lolll
he hard read a swap and almost twitter clipped the shit outta him
oh he killed nana last stock
cosmos almost choked that LOL
He cannot edgeguard sopo
he jabbed them with pyra at like 160
Big D took a stock in 20 seconds LOL
I'm listening to MVD and knives antagonize each other
oh my god he almost took a full stock with sopo LOL
soap would def kill a smasher
ok another 2 stock
A quote from Jibca "ICs could be fucking garbage or lowkey top 10 And I'd be not surprised either way "
They have so much shit but at the same time they have so many weak areas but can also be covered by random technical shit so it's like fucking impossible to say
Riddles killed sopo right away thas crazy
I have no idea what big d is doing but all I know is that I want him at more shit
I need this I don't need byleth
Big D is already up 2-0 on riddles
I don't think Kazuya can 0 to death IC's
ok nvm he did electric and nana ran away LMFAO
Ohh I think I'm holding right too much for LP skip and not just basically down
That'll speed things up
Yeah like after I fall
Ice climbers steve grand finals
So big d is in panda cup finals lol
The canadian color ice climbers win the canada major on canada day weekend
i love this game, i got stuck in the lost woods section
i dont know what to do
just go the right way
whatever the water plant thing
i have NO CLUE
Bear I can show you when I come over
Holy shit the crowd difference between big d and onin LOL
Granted it's a canada event but still
For me it's usually worth it sadly
Big D 0 to deathed last stock
M2K tweeted in all caps "ICE CLIMBERS 0 TO DEATHS ARE ACTUALLY COOL IN THIS GAME"
He didn't even do a true one
he just read a mash in the air with up b and he fucking exploded at 60
I forgot that move is like PM levels of knockback in this game
Nah you'll get 2 ruins keys in mt rugged
Big d was so fucking close to making a sopo comeback
How do you do that against a fresh stock of steve
oh god I forgot I added fresh
Well not a key but still oof
he just used a penis to edgeguard ic's
Steve is a blessing
TK said it was big d's little brother
Someone tweeted a selfie with big d
I forgot he was like 8 feet tall
Yea Kiwi tweeted a pic with him and she was literally half his height LOL
well you're also a giant
Big D lost :(
Steve put blocks offstage and IC's couldn't come back
You can do all but 2 checks in 3, yeah?
Yeah double dipping blows
Why was aaron seeded higher than big d though
Hi there. Been watching your Paper Mario Rando VODs. Thanks for those. Been looking to catch you live one day,
Big D got 9th at genesis, Aaron gets top 32
Big D had 15th seed
That's his region they should know that he doin bullshit LUL
I think it's quebec because coney was french posting
Hmmm, a bit partner starved this seed I see?
Well, the major ones at least
What a month or two for N64 Rando. This has been out for a bit, and DK64 Rando is almost hot off the press
You're gonna play dk64 rando, right phantom :)
N64 Rando is on my to-do list, but right now the only equipment I have to work with for emulators is Dolphin (Metroid Prime 1/2 Rando for me)
I should setup bizhawk
Our community has a cross-game multiworld tourney in-progress. We just started the brackets
Yea it['s very bad
and they scold me to give them money every time I open it and I have to wait a minute to open my rom
One of my brothers has our old N64 and (as of 3 years ago) it still runs. I'm wondering if he'll let me take it
Yea if you open it without having a linked thing of donating you have to wait 30s to open a rom every time
Where was the 1st TBC small key?
where was the train? lol
@TacoGuyy PJ64 devs DON'T want you to google search resource hacker
So how does logic account for battle necessity. Will it try to avoid placing progression in a Chapter 7 scaled area for example?
"To start off I should clarify
We Shrooms are a fickle bunch
literally me anytime I take a day off
Oh not again with Star piece Toy Box
That's fair. I'm a fan of the Danger Mario setup. I don't play defensively in games
there's also like 4 checks there too right?
So one question I've meant to ask. What's your fascination with Attack FX C?
4fp mega bomb is hype
@CaptainMD13 It's literally the Best badge in the game
Still doesn't beat the Super Bombette from last month (The 1 FP across the board one)
I have a PM 64 Badge Tier list coming out in the future at some point
it's an M4 Collab
Sooooooo that's 2 Bow locked major items
Hmmm, and Chapter 7 is off the table too cause Laki right?
Maybe I got my sewers mixed up (Happens a lot)
I'm thinking the spike pit
It is up my alley of stupid
But yeah, I'm guessing 7 or upper KBF
but it actually serves a purpose optimally lol
I have never done it tho
96 Star Pieces does it iirc
Got enough Life Shrooms?
I watched M4 lose an hour to it bc that category also skips Lucky Star
Wow, Super Badge Toy Box apparently
BTW, SGDQ was amazing this year
I watched like 6 runs
My brother nearly cried watching tasbot Ocarina of Time
Hai hai. : D
I too watched a ton of GDQ
@TacoGuy74 Shove him down the stairs and make him actually cry
I did cry at it, Taco.
Highlights for me was ZOOTR, Mario All-Stars ACE, and ESPECIALLY Metroid Dread.
@TacoGuy74 why are you such a tsundere
@buff00n you replied to the wrong one I think
By the way, MH Rise Sunbreak came out and Oh my gog it's so good.
Either way I have no clue what you're talking about
the Ty run was cool
Besides the linkus run I kinda just watched what you said was being presented well
Also, Chapter 6 scaling?
Linkus is very good at solo commentary but I also don't know why he even had 2 comms
1 literally never talked LOL
@TacoGuyy Tsundere would be a good way to describe your online personality I feel
I really enjoyed watching SMO and the new Kirby run
@TacoGuy74 No buff00n is just a bitch
They added a wolfy boy for MH Rise Sunbreak, and, the turf war between it and Zinogre IS THE COOLEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.
Good thing there were like 3 Life Shrooms LUL
Man why is battlebeaver still using a hexagon logo I saw them pop up on twitter and was worried LOL
So remind me again, how often does Ralp's shop update?
@TacoGuy74 takes one to know one, puto
Why do you keep responding to the wrong one
He is red and I'm fucking yellow
If I shared a clip of the wolfy boy vs Zinogre turf war, would you take a look?
Legit the coolest thing I've ever seen.
I messed up this trick so bad in my last RAC run
it made a thread of my response to your response to 74's inquiry
This'll be something else if Bow is here
it's cool that it's the "optimal" strat
you hit that via force of habit
especially since we need laki in this room too
What aspect of talking about my brother nearly crying over Zelda makes me tsundere?
Oh, the bucket thing was a TF2 meme
@TacoGuy74 I called OG TacoGuyy tsundere
It's just this one line from an animation that reached meme status
It'd be a shame if someone....mega bombed them
faster than a refresh
so I cringe every single RAC run
I mean you gotta do what you gotta do
we disrespect 2-3 Jamin' Jellies in that run
So anyways, I started blasting
Hows the rando treating you
(Sorry, bit of a sucker for comedy)
Also how is you
Didn't you mention something about showing this at an event coming up, or did that pass and I missed it?
I came down with a bad case of COVID and Im having a blast lol
Im just speaking words
M4 has the lucky job?
You do not want me rolling seeds. There's a reason my partner and I are called "The Best Seed Rollers" in our Metroid Prime Tourney
But I've just felt very sore and congested but it'll get better
I used to be the primary coordinator for the Prime 2 Weeklies, but my current schedule and the tourney is keeping me too busy, but chat loved it when I genned seeds.
That's a solid couch
Midwest SpeedFest. That was it, I'll try to remember that
dude these clubbas are adorable
And now Im currently watching smash twitter fall to the ground and laughing
Point still stands. Run, he angy
LOOK MAN THAT INKLING IS NAVY
Also Tubba showing off his SA-X AI
Bow on Ralp, let's gooooo
So does the real FP cost now show in the Badge menu?
I got a 107 on shade
I think Shrink Stomp is how I beat Master 1 my first playthrogh
How many life shrooms you got?
(And this was around Chapter 2)
There were like 3 in toy box
missed 2nd place on the stupid board by minute and a half for what its worth
What did tubba do you you huh?
devil has it down to 45 minutes so with some work can easily get it down to sub 1
Made us double-dip his castle for one thing
Keep a key in said castle for another
Also hi Bow, can you tell us where you're at?
yes, im talking about the thing I refuse to submit too
i say that despite I did submit a sub 30 for bn2 LUL
So right now we need Kooper, Bow, Pyramid Stone, and Magic Seeds 1/3/4 and that's it, right?
that was the first time I got sub 30 I was so proud lol
Wow, game calling me a liar psykitHeck
idk man that honey lookin mad nice
if you forget if you have something thats what the tracker is for Kappa
I mean....we need that...just not by itself
track means track, er means the action of doing something LUL
Laki is just a universal Key
So this chapter is either gonna be standard or baby scaled
dont be such a bitch
waits you your mitzi impression "Axl! Listen...listen..."
What a weird day it is to have to be "looking for kooper"
*chuckes* I'm in Danger
Anyone just see a boss?
Nice 1 of a kind Starpiece
For the 1st time literally ever
That may be the most cursed sentence i've heard all day
now that ive learned up to shade I can do lotto codes phanto274Hype
well the snowman's gift checks aren't in logic bc the ch1 bucket
I was a slow typer on that one
"Bow! Why were you hiding in the Mayor's Dresser???"
To spook him obviously
Excuse me, what the psykitHeck ?
it feels wrong to be excited about finding him
Well got an early morning at work tomorrow. Good luck.
Oh lord she commin lol
is this game I dont know if he's shit again
Where else would they be
mega bomb is good and fair
you mega bomb my heart
Is it now lol
yes you saw how long it took him to hammer
just doing my part
i did not but my sob is 45 minutes faster than my pb now NiceSoftlock
gonna try again tomorrow
People have been spamming fireworks for the past 2 weeks
pretty sure i'm not going in on tuesday cuz of sickness either so that's another day for runs
What happened to him...
didyou do weight check?
Hello Phantom5800 playing Rando!?!? lol | !discord !pb !mwsf Paper Mario English Randomizer Retro N64 Speedrun Closed Captions
who knows whats in there
Man you're just having the best of luck rn
it's always super blooper lmfao
i think 9/10 seeds i've played have had something locked behind that chest
That tree has 1 eye ball but 2 pupils
should probably check if my console still doesn't like rando
it's been a bit
I found laki there in my last seed
gonna take a random guess and say it was overheating in the entertainment center it was sitting in before
it was only with rando which i found interesting
never my vanilla carts
but it'd make sense i think
that was excellent comedic timing
fuck it, i'll do a seed offline lol
just in case it explodes again so i don't look sad on stream
phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
are you ending after this?
watching the subtitles try really hard to interpret all the pape terms is so funny
id kill for a sub 4 seed
get on my level
I will be there :D
Did you plan the yellow shirt to match pikachu? It's a nice touch
get a pikachu already slowass
Misogyny makes pokemon runs go round
My chair expired I can no longer sit down in maplestory
Wdym what I didn't stutter
playing let's go even though the titles is legends hmmmm
u going to port priority
I feel like lets go is new enough where it's not going to be quite as effective with the category
oof I thought it was in whika or something
If you named it sway that wouldn't have happened
Yea but he was goated anyways
ok now gotta get back to mass murdering elephants for a lil birt
Look a random dude hiding in a clocktower told me to, I have to
I fucking hate the category name
you didn't skip one trainer nice category
I was gonna mess with the new reworked classes after I got bored of this one but I like this one too much
I got motion inputs, a giant axe, and semi-technical movement from said motion inputs
I got supers and shit too
if I do 21456 I get a big tornado
And I'm one of the 6 legendary heroes so I need it
DP input is a single target move that just fucking nukes bosses
can only use it with full meter tho and that's annoying to build if I'm not in a field
scales off hitcount but I also have a button to just fill it every 4 minutes
ok back to murdering shit I'm almost at level 200
I think 300 is the cap I forget if they raised it or not
I'm sad tho because this quest series had a cool plot I was enjoying but the boss is really fucking bugged rn and keeps DC'ing me halfway into the fight so I can't finish it
this clocktower dude is sending me into the hell forest now
maybe I shouldn't have mass murdered elephants for him
I wanted to hear komari's brazil lady rap LUL
Down In Pumpkin Braz-Hill LUL
I had a sick shadowman fight today, I one turned him lol
emotion bug is so good
how the fuck do I navigate the hell forest this shit sending me all over
This forest is reducing my characters sanity and there's spooky trees 'n' shit
oh you said hell forest so I assumed pape lol
The longer I'm in the forest the lower my max hp gets while im in there
and I have to reset my sanity with a mage if I don't wanna die
I was told to go to a mansion in the back of this shit and this shit just a maze
just don't go insane
the hallucinations are getting so thick I can't see shit
I tried to look up a map and this forum post just said "don't"
this the best gains I need my 4 levels >:(
no they said this area is bullshit LOL
Thor changed his twitter pfp to a lovelive girl and I hate it
he's not watched it he just said he thought it was funny
all gyms should be like this
I hate doing filler battles
I just want to go fast
@buff00n soon you'll sub to phantom, poor ass
when I'm not broke af, sure
I only care about filler battles if they are randomized cause that's exp and I want to see what I'm going up against
yelling at a friend, cuz they can't accept that fighting games aren't as responsive as most other video games by design
tell him he's ass at fighting games and move on with your night
I only remember hate
the only quote I remember is quote #1
I can't remember how to
do I win an Oreo?
I ate the last pack of oreos
the last pack of The Most Stuf Oreos
most stuf oreo is so cursed
Uhhhh because they felt like banning the hard one
that's not just an ordinary Pikachu, that's a Detective Pikachu.
just a a big 5, add 100 to 100%, and 2P
Work had free sandwiches today and it was rad
I got 2 club sandwiches
Ok I found a map
I'm outta that stupid shit
oh thank god it spawned me back here
why does this damn mountain also kill my sanity
did you make out yet
I've not been paying attention I've been navigating this stupid area and talking to people
just noticed your category
when I run bn5 Im gonna pick a different bn game everytime
just to fuck with everyone
Also hows the run treating you
I'll title it after the catergory
I can see it now...
ASMR STREAM!!! | Another Shitty Megaman Run |
I just use retro so the live bot doesnt list me in discord
also since there is such a disconnect with teambn is it even worth submitting to the board?
like i play the game because its fun
I grinded bn2 to get a wr then got bopped a week later. I never want to do that again
i felt like id get it enventually so i never stopped
the last bn2 run I did I got a 2nd prism from the trader so there is other stuff we can do, plus jugoomba is maniping Dash in single segment
Someone make the fireworks stop lol
you sound like Hikari
yesterday I reached out to JP Kellams on twitter, he confirmed he did translate bn6 which was pretty cool.
he started at capcom, moved to platinum worked on bayonetta, then EA, and now he's at Epic.
Find it interesting to see how devs more around
title my game whatever jugoomba, risch, or komari is streaming LUL
Bro just watched an ad for butterfinger now I'm hungry LUL
ive got your raid msg
Scooby was lit, PBed in Warpless so that's dope
"well, if it isnt the hottie thotty with a naughty body"
bot is still subbed from me lmao
oh shit u have 7tv
AND you put dog island emotes?!
it was on 6/6
he needs to make another funny quote
funnier than... Ok failbot didn't go yesterday so it was like final where he talks about the abomination that is Origami King? LuL
my nephew was playing the pokemon mmo and showing it to me.
I liked the presentation
was like gen 3 engine in HD, but battles on gen 5 engine
its hard as fuck
lorelie has a cloyster with skill link
oh snap, since shasta is back from gdq he is stream streetpass lol
this would be the time to do that
if I went to gdq id bring all on my 3DS
i think im down to 4 but one is still sealed
the fire emblem awakening bundle
one day I hope to meet laura bailey and have her open and sign it
I just saw what game this was under
what I look for in starmie is HP 109-122, Def 82-96, SpAtk 106-120, SpDef 82-96, Spd 110-124
alright I'm back I was adding like so many emotes to my channel MozzarellaSticks
my practice save has a HP 113 ATK 74 DEF 88 SPATK 123 SPDEF 87 SPD 123
no prob, im always down for calling out communities LUL
Is the timeloss primarily real or diff catches/evo
haven't seen you run Let's Go in while
grinding for 3:01 now
the 3:02 has a minute long optional so I want to get one without it, and maybe push for 3:00
oh that's the roughest one
it's better to just do them after Sabrina
yea because you have to heal after Sabrina anyway so you're double menuing
if you depost before
yea golds are kind of pointless until after Sabrina
I use a one page printout with just the shops and some ranges now for notes
as long as you have an antidote, an awakening and one of the fake full heals you're fine
Yo I got a 4pm pool for doubledown
Jesse got a 10am ripbozo
Is a sway pikachu
I saw a stupid twitter thing that was a twitter family thing so I clicked on the site "don't tweet" cause I just wanted to look first
and it fucking tweeted anyway and tagged everyone
and ohrocks was my spouse
random art account I follow and RT was a child
Oh god Splash had one and it made him marry pallos
I can't complain anymore
Looking at a list of MN players on a tier list maker and like there's very little character variety here besides the top people
Like at least they're playing good chars but it's just all swordies
Lucky mad good but plant has so many bad matchups
There is so much fire emblem and link and palu on this list
both link and yink
Idk they think he's cool but then I camp him
Get another sway pb this instant
ayo fuck that guy
Tux is in my doubledown pool
Buff00n passed him along
a megaman player is before that ugh
The lack of murder characters is why our #2 is pplant
If I manage to get RAC into the marathon i'm after I asked M4 and Arie to be my couch
Went in with 1 yesterday
i mean, you KNOW the game knows.
i can't be convinced they aren't sentient
bombette was on a treadmill lol
how many panels are in the game?
that doesn't sound bad
does that include chapter 8?
not doing letters in marathon?
after I do mitzi's seed I want to try panels
I know where a few are
I'll use a guide for the ones I don't know til I memorize them
crazy how the races just died
u drowned? that sucks
did you just throw a hammer?
@trustyaltruist yeah my bad, i meant sinking
call an ambulance, but not for me
tbf i received swim lessons every year as a kid and i still can't swim
I hate the ocean
i could float but not get anywhere
I like looking at it tho
I've always been afraid of submerging my head
also don't like my face getting wet
Hai hai. : D
Oooh. Looks like I got here fairly early.
Where'd you find your companions?
Rigby had a seed this morning, was nice to chill since work was dead
Poor Sushi being exiled to the desert.
also I changed my name to pink today lol
mitzi called me out LUL
Welcome to the best color, Axl.
Axl, Listen! you are green to me! LMAO
you have a different shade viki
There's one piece of Exodia.
okay she didn't go that far but wish she did LUL
At least you got a mushroom to heal that trap damage.
Cheer100 Phantom going shinedown on us Don't you know I broke the mold Like a hammer to a landmine
What was that alert LUL
Is that moment clipped?
Begging your pardon Parakary?
shinedown is a band and when you hammered bombette it reminded me of them
would they be considered butt rock?
i think i get hinder and shinedown mixed up
I always forget that hidden block
also when you start with sushi do you get the upgrade block in toad town
here i though my boi was picky HahaSweat
I know otherwise it's pretty slow
i mean i do too tbf
It's be nice if key items had a slightly altered sprite like they do in Kirby Air Ride
Yeah, if it's a trap
Like for example the Tubba key missing the black dot in the center
Or Bombette not having her fuse
Oh yeah, it'd have to be the mildest of changes
Flower saver with a 3 FP Power Bomb? I like the sound of that
That works for me, my watching schedule doesn't free up until Friday anyway
I actually gotta bust outta here now and lurk to sleep before work (up 3 AM). So good night and good luck.
How do you wall?
Is there like ever a case where you just fight Kent? Like if Chapter 1 is Chapter 1 scaled?
I just witnessed heresy.
Ok I think we're good on Repel Gel's, thanks
Now can we have that 3rd Ruins key?
Do you think that this is fake?
the power of ultra stone give it back!
you already had gotten a fake one in toy box
I think that I was there for that.
not like you do with the star kids Phantom
you bully them more
Last Stand is going to either be 1 or like.. six BP
Called it. : D
But don't you want to struggle for our entertainment?
I'm banking on another French vanilla TBC Small Key
And that becomes 1 FP with FSaver sooooo
Hey! Saw ur vid on my youtube recommended and came to check out the stream
Just go beat Bowser right now.
Yup! Thats right :D
oh don't be, i work for a school district and it's summer so it's not as wild haha
woke up from a nap to find myself here
that sweet sweet IT work
i remembr reading that in high school
there was a girl that had all the volumes and would bring them to class
yeah, im my circle of high school friends we would collect different manga
yeah, cannot re-read that as a 30 year old ass man
imagine a pokey pet emote with needles sticking out of mario's hand KEKW
glad i did this, but FUCK
ive always been really good with emote ideas
but I want you to
this better add up to something Kappa
really... dividing your time between toad town and shiver city :)
I'd rather fight ch 7 Jr than type on mobile
that's all i got.
calculator jokes are underrated
what settings are you doing?
what do the numbers next to the star spirits mean? They weren't randomized, I thought
my seed for v0oidathon almost forced me into anti guy in sphere 0
I had bow. and I had access to lemon candy...but the ingredients where held hostage by shy guys..in a ch 7 scaled ch 4
oh no,rigby did your seed die?
no, my cats are meowing like they are in pain so I'm taking a break to check on them
that's the dried shroom from ttyd
LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
Is it really random?
Has the luck been good so far?
Damn that sucks lol
Oh fuck yeah I just saw lol
now im watching 2 rando seeds at same time
this and 1 on me phone
got to go somewhere
ill keep stream open
How goes today's randomizer?
Have you tried turning it off and not turning it back on again?
If nothing else, you have some seriously cracked badges.
Welp, at least you already know by the point it's gonna be long.
Do we know your FP Plus BP cost yet?
(Can't remember if you have one already or not)
An aquaintance of mine from a server I'm in actually made a concept for a timed treasure hunt for Paper Mario Randomizer.
I play MH. That was not too fast.
Yeah, basically, certain types of items you collect are worth a certain number of points, and you have 3 hours to collect as much points as possible.
What I find funny is he made Goombario worth double as many points as the other partners because he's such a burden. XD
I think it was also designed with maximum randomizer settings in mind, other than always starting with one partner.
Ah yes, here it is. Badges and Star Pieces are worth 1 point each, Important Items and Partners are worth 5 points each, and Goombario and Each Star Spirit is worth 10 points each.
So the max point total was 530.
You can only hope by the time you have to come here you have Lakilester. Makes it a bit faster.
where are you going now?
audio is laggy let me refresh
yo outback is here!!
gonna grab my steak
dont be such a bitch
what did I miss
my medium rare steak was cold but still loved it
you got super mega ultra digivolve boots
damn 1fp mega bomb
need that in my rando seeds
but yeah you just got ultra boots
with a last stand set up, it definitely is
you're missing something important
There was one sandwich left at work and I took it immediately
It was a chipotle club I had to
yellow shyguys :O almost as good as pink ones
look at this baby ass seed
im playing some dbd with my friends. trying to convince a group of em to play among us cause i feel like gaslighting people
When was the last time we played among us phantom
How long ago was that loll
time to play again mwahaha
I forget if we ever played after my birthday that one year
We were playing that shit so much when prox came out
how is the run going Phantom?
are you doing more after this run?
that means bn6 rando!!
lets go rando would suck
Pokemon randos are fun
but only if you nuzlocke
okay pokemon randos are fun, but theN you hear phantom bitch about how much he doesnt like it KEKW
what the fuck is your inventory
seed was really fun [after i found laki]
really doesn't take that long to learn panels tbh
i've done like maybe 5 hundo runs and know where they are
do a 6th hundo run
im interested in learning them
mm = my mpapermario
mega man 2 is my favorite zelda game
its from twilight princess
no going fast allowed
Uh oh LK tweeted about wanting emotes
He summoned the bots
i was so annoyed having to full clear ch7 for sushie in my last seed lmao
that's one of the worst chapters to have to do that for
I love Flower Fields. If I could, I would replace all areeas with Flower Fields. The amount of skill, calculations, and sheer intelligence involved in navigating the many entrances make for the most memorable area in Paper Mario. I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to skip this area or even worse, remove it from the game. The only possible substitute that comes to mind is The Great Boggly Tree, but that is a story for a different day.
yeah 6 is fun to do in rando, it doesn't really take long besides moles and rosie
that one also has a lot of checks on that path
so it's not as bad
twitter talking about next switch, okay thats enough twitter for today
when aren't they though
i reached out to aixi for a battle network commission
so imagine OG acdc town painted, but in a 4 piece in a diamond layout
morph sucks at major league
we do slowruns around these parts
your bn3 follower goal was 350, you increased it LMAO
let me grab my old screen cap
now where the hell is ms paint!?
oot hundo no srm is sub 3:50 now wtf
happened this morning lmao
I was about to bring that up
That was the run that started after I went to bed lol
He has touhou on his splits he's based
when is triforce% getting bopped?
It's just sakuya anymore but it's still touhou
how did I type just
this is a different ace
The best ace is still the pokemon yellow one
a lot of it was showing flavor text
i'm guessing you sending us to Rigby after this hehe
oh? random is live
im gonna tell him you said that
hehe he is white
DIE COTTON CANDY DIE!!!
it's the final battle!
ace could get you there
with boss rush, it should warp us to that duplighost room after the last star spirit is saved tbh
you could jsut call time when you get your last card
we'll call it phantom%
my brother walked in and said, "hey he looks like our cousin!" Me: dont insult phantom like that LUL
Wow phantom you look like their cousin
Wow phantom you look like their cousin
Final battle time for the 49th time
I am not allowed to use any food delivery app, apparently
I don't blame them
I ordered food, it didn't arrive
well hes called buff00n for a reason LUL
easy win secend win
How do I how do I always get here at the end of your runs LUL
I order, then SOMETHING always happens
what will the title be called on youtube?
did you get your 7 cap?
i don't think i've ever seen a 7 on final
honestly that sounds like it'd be a bad thing in some categories
like you just do too much damage lmfao
how is too much dmg bad?
he can heal starting on turn 2
so unless you beam on turn 1, he's probably gonna heal
forgot a check n ice palace and called it quits lmaoo
thanks for the stream
He swapped to pape
he forgot to change the category lol
I had to speedrun my raid because I knew you were finishing
the raid your problem now
maybe i was so early it seemed late
the ending music is so nice
was just thinking how funny it would be to swap between you and komari everytime one of you resets LMAO
Hey I hope you're having a great day! I love watching you speedrun and I watch you pretty much every day it's so awesome and entertaining watching you play and I think you're really cool and talented. I want to support you and see you achieve your goals. I believe in you
doing a stream before the game?
ill be doing a meet up with laichan next week
hows that any different?
did you see my smart watch pic?
Pikachu spedran to oak's lab
bn7 PET will just be a watch LUL
wonder how they'd handle new forms
Watching your pokepark run really made me wanna play it again
Congrats on the PB the other day
I heard first bug breakout
Really hope they make a pokepark3 for the switch and or port the first two
oh well, if you match without the optionals its like a 3:15 - 3:16
I was there lol
It was a grimer right?
yea theres luck for sure, but its definitiely rewards consistentcy
It was in the mansion
Get two shinys then
lol like 15, I once had a run with both Snorlax and Raticate shinies
I have a good amount of shinies from pkaying competitively anyway so its not a big deal to me
brock is the useless split
as long as I'm not like a true minute behind it doesnt matter
my gold is 17:07 in Pika for Brock
Do you have a favorite Pokmon spin-off game?
the end of the tail is not in the hit box also, I go for moon onix
Love the ranger games
especially not on lure its not a bad chance
moon onix >>>> rt onix
I deleted a bunch of runs recently
eventually i'll come back to let's go
Or just be like my not loaded to youtube Eevee PB where I catch Fearow, Golbat, and RT Onix
that run was awful
now my Pika PB I got a supersize cleafairy right after I deposited everything
less likely to get Poison Gas, you keep Oddish until Gloom, but I have different variants of the JJ fight because on my nature and stats at level 9
I also run minus Sp. Atk Pika
the 3:02 run is Jolly
it technically makes my first shop faster too
because I dont get x sp. atk
yep do that 2 turns
go for ekans first
so one thing I do is almost always catch Rat or Pidgey on Rt 2 just for the situation you find yourself in now
I deposit and go for Otto, risky but the Exp is worth it
Ill do it before Vermillion to get Growlithe to level 18
but not always, how I play depends so much on Pikachus level and Attacking Stats
its more dynamic than you could put into notea
seeing talk on twitter, imagine next gdq being in hawaii lol
its only because Ive done so many runs and have tried a failed a lot of different variants
it would be so worth
level 18 or really high atk I switch to Headbutt to save text screens
whats your take on walking into pink gorilla and potentially being on stream?
gotcha, he's doing a subathon so lurking for maybe a free gift LMAO
love the idea of streaming from a game shop
i never thought of that
agumon ha to funnier if he wants a sub lol
yeah, have him post in general
yea, that was good considering what happened
i saw that switch fans are getting excited for pokemon puzzle league. Nothing wrong with that but they have to wait a whole month just for a single game. "looks over at everdrive on GodsIntendedConsole "
oh that was a great, I'm used to seeing 475 exp on the pidgey catch
I always grab fire stone and evolve growlithe now and uses arcanine as a ride
yes, I switch, there's a long winded reason behind it that'll be tldr to write
basically fairy sac -> growlithe evolve at next menu and switch rides in hideout
it's risky for JJ Tower though
caterknees is actually the player I got the idea from
oh, Tuesday I hit them again so I spent an hour practicing a new technique to pass them
yea, that's my problem, but there's a small dirt circle immediately in front of them that I run to then slowly pass through
you're fine it's level 18
if you got gloom you got sandshrew
I've definitely run into that spinner a few times
so it's faster to add a pokemon to party over another party member
it adds and removes at the same time
gl on the rest on the run!
Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3
catch all the pokemon
catch like 20 or so more pokemon
I saw that you were playing Arceus and was like "wait, he's speedrunning a game I don't think he finished casually?"
and here I see Definitely Not Arceus
I still haven't finished O_O
word I never thought I'd hear
no shiny time to reset
ight best of luck go win or somethin
in BW, Starmie was the Pokemon I used to solo the Black Tower/White Tree and the E4
at least you got some XP/EVs?
Does Bruno still have two Onix?
you mean psychic doesn't just OHKO everything on her team?
Starmie looks back and whispers to you each time, "You're losing time, kekeke"
how is it a range at +6? Does it have Multiscale?
oh it's mega lol
lmao trying to use Solarbeam without sun
how did this guy become champion?
are you commentary for glenn?
that's like 10p anyway
thank you for saving me
i woke up to my air matress deflating
the nob got turned somehow
Matress: get your ass outta bed
it was like climbing out of a hamick
i know all the settings except for the toad at the end
all the settings? you mad man lol! gl hf
wrong tree but sure
yo icebound, whats good
was the new fetch quest added to the rando or is it in vanilla?
but how early can you do it?
i think that's it, yeah, post ch1
hello wiggle friendo cats4eWiggle
I'm donating plasma and then o have to drive half an hour outta town to visit a friend permitDead
2 coins oh boy!
If I don't get cake when I go visit this friend ill be upsetti. She's having a party for her kid
I demand cake if I am to be in the presence of children
note to self: dont have children
Oh wow sushi and watt. They really said go to lava lava right off the bat
sushi was on the island
as she should be Kappa
I like having the stream on full screen and chat on my laptop
coin is a bargain!!!
Oh man you gotta get that singular coin for a million star pieces
It only makes sense
so this rando's exchange rate is 1 coin to 4 star pieces
yo that storeroom had like 8 star pieces KEKW
i'd like to rework Merlow some time, his shop is usually pretty meh atm ..
are you using the new hit box Kappa
And we thought the fuzzys were thieves
Koopas out here stealing kitchen utensils
last rando I learned something
yellow yoshi wont take a super soda
LET'S GO RANDO RANDY sNeeds!!!!!
heard a loud crash just now
cat knocked over the rack for setting up balls on the pool table smh
My cat likes to open cabinets and hide in them
he just wanted his face scratched, he took off running LUL
I sunk a ball on break today, will never happen again lol
Why didn't you check the volcano when you were on lava lava?
that's not the boi
he doesn't play baseball and his name isn't Goombario
Oh yeah you had no parakarry or laki
Man the plasma place is super behind today. My appointment was for an hour and 15 minutes ago and I haven't even started donating yet
I'd usually be dont by now
you need kooper for the bridge tho
are you doing "surfer dude" strats?
mushroom kingdom doesnt check for bombs/weapons in the mail?
LP must be too hard for you lol
i should probably remove that wall ...
get the goomba or I will cry
i mean, i put it there in the first place
ill look into it
with koopa bros ive seen leonardo and donatelo
damn... koopa bros are just missing mikey
ain't gotta be at the venue until 4pm my time
exactly what it means
it's 1pm my time
buff00n you missed it
our pools start at 4pm
PhantomGamesBot: Haha took numer one slot for axl if everyone stops doing randos we can start at like 160
i just looked back here, this is a dank looking fight
yeah they're surprisingly resistant
actually enjoying the song...
ajo wth, i just checked the koopa bros sleep chance, and all 4 have different chances??
green 70, red 30, blue 40 and yellow 60
slowly getting closer to bn3 SS
I want that coin you have on clearance. "yes sir, that'll be 1 coin please."
first try on getting my name right
thats a new record
hi phantom it's Brett <3
are you playing this on an emulator or console?
fuck that guy I got my phone back
he also said he loves this song
brett makes a better mod anyways Kappa
hello! saw your youtube stuff and wanted to hop in
I recently finished my first playthrough on an emulator and it was kinda broken
love me some paper mario randos
its always fun to call out mods
yeah I found you on yt as well
yours is the premiere yt channel for regular pm rando videos
i just like to watch the randomizer cause pain lol
I like looking for randomizers on games I liked playing
I got into super mario rpg randomizers because of that
there's others that stream it a lot but don't upload to yt. their fault ig lol
I've ran those so many times
i like the SMZ3 randomizer
I think the way we met was in jcog's stream "hey Axl, im gonna be running bn6" that def got my attention LUL
haven't done many Z1
have a good one!
bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL
that name sounds familiar
I have a friend who is top 200 in the world
his name is bond
damn bandits just not givin you a break
anyways I wanted to play paper mario randomizers but playing it on an emulator is not the best
least you have laki
so idk what to do
i've never had issues with bizhawk
oh im using p64
that might be it
p64 is ass shit
coming from someone who uses it
project 64's catchphrase should be "we run mario 64 good, and thats about it"
I didnt wanna deal with setup stuff so i went everdrive
i only use p64 for mario 64 rom hacks, cause bizhawk doesn't like them
paper mario on project 64 did weird things, like if there was too much stuff on the screen every single model would just disappear
it was especially bad on big rooms like in the volcano
if there was one extra thing everything just disappeared
because the room was so big
also the darkness effect where you have to use watt just didnt work
I had to fight lantern ghost without the darkness effect so it was very confusing
Goombario Slander is Cringe He's just as awesome as all the other Super Mario Characters, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'basic'. FREAKING LOVE GOOMBARIO!1!1!>:(
also I thought koopa koot would actually give you something good at the end of his questline so I did every single favor
I also did every single letter
that one wasnt as bad
I think your bot is having a stroke
kinda reminds me of the deep leffen bot
I thought the bosses were gonna be a lot harder when I played tbjs
but I saw everyone raving about the later bosses
I didnt know what I was doing
and I got lucky on crystal king clones so that probably helped
actually yknow what huff n puff was definitely the hardest boss
I hurt my arm mashing for that fight
I made it through fine but he was the only boss to cause irl damage
I got to the final boss at level 20 I think
later game fights were just power quake + power bomb
Monstar's sooo hard to block
I never saw monstars attack I killed him on the first turn
the only badge I had that raised my attack was all or nothing
PGbot had a stroke and I missed it?!
but I used watt's powerup attack a lot in the later fights because I didnt have a lot of attack power
watt was the only partner I used for the bowser fight because he pierced defense
have you been to forest?
my most used partners were bombette, parakarry, and watt
i like having squirt at 1 fp
I used lakilester for huff n puff and bow for tubba blubba's heart but thats about it when it comes to other partners
oh yeah and I used sushie for lava piranha
who's your favorite partner character wise?
id say bombette character wise
my favorite character wise is bow
ive seen m4 blow the wall up early so ive been doing that
I also like parakarry as a character
where are the Panel Percy's at?
are you saying that you wouldn't sell a red jar and 2 letters in your shop?
I've played every paper mario game except the first 2 so I decided to play this one and I'm gonna start ttyd soon
where did you start?
the first one I ever played was super paper mario
when I was a kid
the first one I completed was sticker star
and then I beat super
and I also beat color splash and origami king when they came out
I enjoyed them I dont get the hate
theres a block there?
do you find the combat fun?
the hate comes mostly from people expecting more pm64 or ttyd and not gett it
I get that sorta but I think they split off from that format because of the mario and luigi games
just give me a reason to do the fights
and the fight itself isnt enough
I'm so upset about that m&l is my favorite nintendo series
I have every single game
Bowser's inside story remake dug alphadream's grave
as much as I've enjoyed the paper mario games nothing compares to bowsers inside story
that game is perfect imo
i finished the first 2 and started the 3rd one, solid games
Partners in Time is very cool! :^)
I really like every game
partners in time is probably my least favorite if I had to choose one
but I dont hate it
I still love it
I have an unsigned copy from Phantom
I also have both of the remakes
the only issue I have with partners in time is they took abilities away from mario and luigi to give it to the babies. Just seemed so backwards. give them unique ones
if AlphaDream remade those games on switch, I think it would've made a difference
bowsers inside story 3ds came out in like 2019
around the same time as luigis mansion and metroid 2
3ds is still my favorite nintendo system
oh Mansion definitely needed to be on switch
they could've been more experimental on switch
thats why I got the xl version
DS lite hurts too
I have a ds lite
switching from my ds lite to my 2ds xl is such a difference
it agrees with my agreement
my New 3DS XL is on it's final breath and it's becoming slowly unusable
I broke my old 3ds xl but thats because I wasn't taking good care of it
and it was right after I got platinum and got shiny stinko
how do you skip the text so fast
is that in the base game
that wouldve been helpful when my chapter 5 got reset
I play with slow text and slow go at the start
game is unplayable otherwise
these partners are being held hostage
ohrocks for the true RP immersion
im probably gonna lurk now since I ran out of stuff to talk about
Phantombot is a best friend
wrong % and wrong game but I wouldn't be opposed
it's Mario Mario and Luigi Mario!
we can feed gourmet guy actual food
there's nothing to debate
it's by law we need to feed him food and poison
I'll stick to GBA COM ty
to be fair, me telling risch about speed got him to join LUL
ShyGuys out for blood NotLikeThis
can't wait to see anti guy fight
youll have to wait for next stream
you streaming the game tonight? Kappa
how could you skip gourmet guy?
okay, watch is telling me to exercise
it's called laki clip
like every clip in this dumb game
stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence
I don't like that
do it for the memes
I'M DOIN MY BEST!!!
Koopa Koot better get himself Lifeshroom insurance if he doesn't give you the goods.
any bet-er's in chat? modCheck
to see how this goes stickshamChaos
35 cals doing curls fifiChad
you got that epic mystery
why is mystery so bad?
see it worked Kappa
it's actually really good, you just have to be good at using it.
you can just practice using mystery
but you could get WR?
the mystery? item is the future of Paper Mario 64 speedruns!
kinda mean trap ngl
yeah, I saw a real life gamer girlfriend but not yours. Her heart belongs to a freakin' speedrunner he resets a lot and dont PB but she says he's the perfect mixture of dedication and self-loathing. She loves him and losing good runs is their world. bleedPurple
should've gotten another mystery?
Who is your favorite partner in the game?
phantom I need to ask
was that guy really streaming the simpsons under PLA?
Ive woken up on a saturday morning and found shrek movie under speedrun tag
chat made it so much fun LUL
where's the educational stream tag?
what the meme, "you cheated only yourself"?
Sorry I'm late, what'd I miss?
Your tracker just screams "all over the place"
Phantom how are you so good at this game? Not only did you have flawless fights, but you also used mystery successfully!
What's the Pink Toad setting? I know the other 6
im still waiting to see it
and ive been here 2 and a half hours
Well entrenched in Danger Mario I see
i spelled it wrong anyways
Good Grief, 8 FP WutFace ?
fake shoutout the link is wrong LUL
Nice BP costs, but I imagine the FP isn't as cooperative
Oh yeah, 6 FP Mega Quake
goomba king has koopa leaf
we've done prologue correct?
imagine if you had Mega Rush?
he really did glennj5BONK
should've had that damage dodge
anti guy looks like he's going to hurl
anti guy did warn you not to fight him
lurking reset, help me backseat him KEKW
Welp, 4 Spirits before Chapter 6 KEKW
I take it Allsanity doesn't enable all 11 Rip Cheato checks
at this point the koopa leaves are in some ch6 vine
hate to interrupt the speedrun, but could you check if that ultra shroom respawns?
okay then. welp, f me
I can't believe Mario has to spin all the way to Bowser's Castle on a Saturday! All the way to Bowser's Castle!
that coin is special
I knew at some point I guess, but never really thought about it
guess it's for when you don't have items for the ice walls?
aboutta head out to the venue
my bracket is MegaMan into tux into brett
did you get pre bracket Wendy's?
we just studied the MegaMan
yes ohrocks I did
well I came in at a fun time
I needa piss and these people take years in the bathroom
aww i wanted the jacked lakitu to punt a spiny at you
also buff00n laid ass up on the couch and combo breaker made much more sense
Jesse sent a pic to smoov
he got more cake than he eats
in the seed I had earlier koot kept like 5 items so I had to complete that assholes favors
I keep getting late supper cycle
ok time to go waynerGoChimp
if your koopa leaf is in star haven i get vip KEKW
and if it isn't I get vip
THE ACURSED ONE RETURNS
LUL LUL LUL LUL
i wonder if there is a pokemon hack the dresses up the trainer as Lan
oh phantom, last night jameike joined the race. did the countdown 3 2 1, and left the call before saying "go" KEKW
did you hand in lyrics?
i tried to tellrigby but he wouldnt listen
don't need to shrink when I power bounce him for free
could've had Mega Rush for 2 hours
how did I miss Goombario
can you make sub 4?
goombario was given to him but i forget where
yeah in the lobby
and never even so the non-replenishing koopa leaf
12 hour challenge is next month
theme is you must complete every stage, nothing youd be interested in LMAO
when is yur marathon?
but what if you hit 400 followers by then 4Head
i was just memeing LUL
if only orange koopa
I don't but go ahead
power shock is always fastest
Mario applying the repel gel against his biggest hater
ggs run was a mystery
metroid prime is some cool stuff
did you see it?
now to make that draw consistent LUL
I am excited to see this start to finish
my ass will not leave this seat
I am also high as fuck rn
the other day I went to the store to buy treats from my pupper and and charity girl stopped to ask me if I liked children, I responded with a firm "Hell No!!" Then I let her talk about her thing for 20 seconds and I but in with... you just saw me walk out of petco. Ask me if I like dogs next time. Then I left OMEGALUL
thats funny axl LUL
wish I could race but at least I can watch, which means I won't be playing this seed lol
@PerMitzi I try to please
I probably wont talk but I'll still be here lurking
I talk enough to make up for the lurkers KEKW
who u think is the better snake shogun or mvd.. or apollokage
really I thought shogun would be slightly.. he just doesn't go to alot of events
everyone knows phantom 5800 snake is godlike top tier he just stop playing.. lol
not even the bot likebuster only
i would join but i cant even play pape rn
imagine starting a race without mitzi axlsenS
Komari says, Agumon's right, it's a bad category Kappa
i believe in trnarrw
blue screen of death
lurking lost 2 50/50 3rd encounter was 2 mets and trnarrw and got rflctr
you hate to see it
i love skipping lp
didn't expect you to join another glitchless* race, how come? just feeling like it?
laki jumps are, i think?
yup, bubble berry tree and tubba table
geyser skip, tubba quick escape ..
@PerMitzi i see Mitzi is getting lost in Jade Jungle again LUL
Good Luck to phantom and nobody else 4Head
oh and artifact jump is also allowed for some reason
I forgor to gamble
volt shroom is faster than letting them atk you
what does whacka's bump taste like?
I knew it was 30 but this is a race afterall
Hi Phantommm, it's Brett <3
only berries and only tree or bush?
not a big deal but would be a nice QoL if when you picked up a star piece it showed your total count
poor lurking, couldnt get anything going
bn games be liek that
I think in almost every rando ive done, I have trouble finding the pulse stone
wow this rando REALLY wants to give you blueberries
that fuzzy is literally the worst
he rudely logged off my account on my laptop
Was that a red berry at whale screen?
mhh the logic implications
i think that's the earliest Ultrahammer + Ultraboots in logic I've seen so far
i guess. still odd
you can't early ruins as you break logic, but you can ruins jump to break logic?
in before Parakarry on pokeys
Is it alarming that I'm finiding you trading star pieces at 1:13?
Oh hai Magical Seed 3
I don't think I've seen you do a PM Rando seed where money has been an issue before
That looks vanilla to me
I meant the scaling
Is this like a community weekly?
You know Goombario is next, right?
LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
Nah, calling logic is just a normal day for me
gotta bounce, gl on the rest!
I'm betting Chapter 3
So much the better
I got a dragonite
It was my 6th shiny dragonite I dont need it lolol
I think the seed is trying to tell you something KEKW
Buff00n keeps muting your tab
He hates you I think
I got my pic with EE I have nothing else I want to do there
Unless I wanted to hug hbox and get 27 illnesses
Sounds like a great idea
Also Im playing cloud for the secondary now
brb quick cley is here uninvited
yo, just had a perfect cloudman fight
I just came off my Echoes Rando tourney match and that was bad too. An early-game item was flat out deleted from the logic
He wants to talk to you
What did quizmo do
Ugh, and Lunar Stone and Bean only lock bosses so they can be just about anywhere
My brother is sending me out to get food when I'm still covid positive
THATS WHAT IM SAYING
The audio is delayed slightly
that happens to me all the time, just pause and unpause
phantom, do you wanna be famous?
Eldstar Star Storm is cursed
I said what I said
haha ty it's ok
how can I explain the sound?
i don't know how haha
think this is a reasonable explanation
Revenge of the convenience
and hopefully he gives peril after shield turn lol
oof, if i close the stream but have pop out chat open I dont get channel points
this isn't too bad tho, it's 9 less damage than what a good phase 1 would have
since ideally he starts at 66
ive been watching on bros pc not logged into twitch with pop out on mine
probably gonna have to double repel but yeah should be fine
never in runs lmfao
i don't blame you lmfao
grabbing snack for this
learning more colonel today
darkmega is be providing content
I got 3 antidmg with shadowman then got wrecked by airhoc KEKW
I used to watch sparkle run that, then ironmon happened axlsenWut
no different than watching shiny hunting
i stumbled on a speedrun I never saw today
arkham asylum, top runs are barely just over 1 hour. The idea for 12 hour challenge is there but prob wont
gl on the run and congrats on the PB
what not trying for 3:00? lol
my 3:02 hits a minute optional so I kind of have to go for it
also just me being dumb in that moment
found eevee on mercari for 15 bucks
we fuckin died from laughter last night
omg... I just now realized the song is called Staying Alive
for the past 30 years I thought it was "Stay In The Light"
surely im not the only one....
they were literally saying stay in the light!
I come into the kitchen: MVD TacoGuyy and Brett are dead cuz they came up with "ice-clussy"
"DMs. DMs, DMs DMs."
damn he just repeats
got a 4:08 despite full clearing
so it was pretty good lmao
koot foiled my plans again
had to do up to glasses
yeah I only double dipped 3
and 7 I guess if you count snowman gifts then ice palace later
I technically double dipped 2 for the check past 4th key
because I spent a while looking for last seed
wait, I double dipped 4 because lantern ghost had my seed.
but those double dips were very quick
winding path had every good badge
power bounce, all or nothing and dodge master
I've always done that
because I always liked the +1 catch and not requiring a fast ponyta spawn for a fast route 17
wr strats weren't wr stats when wr was made
i found a new place to keep phantombot quotes
just whisper them to it KEKW
it was outspeed by Golbat so I think - speed
yet you can still PB because Alexa still loses you a minute 30
were you minus atk
ooga booga there's some spooky ghosts in my Pok'mon game
I just woke up right now
but it's called Let's Go Pikachu, not Let's Go nothing
Pewter Crunchies for people with the Pewter Munchies
thats the one risk of arcanine
its fast so things might not pop up in time to see
game said no wtf?
8ball says... very likely in a future yet to be seen.
have you been in the PSR discord the last few days?
what was it I didn't catch it
so we learned the actual catch formula so there are going to be minor reroutes to get more great balls
wtf is a toejam and earl?
besically player 2 will have GBs as well for RT and on route 17 used Ultra and Great Balls
still true but Id rather have the consistent catches
I made spreadsheet for it already
but my reroute only grabbed one item. actually cooking rn cant get to it
did you type in the cp?
I killed with every rosa move
those are just LV 10 bots
It took me 2 hours to find a ness for down b...
Thats what Im saying
I have no idea
I memed a steve until 360 and killed with down throw
Hey it's a 62% chance, there's still hope in this run
odds got slightly better
it's RNG manipulation stickshamGaslight
Work shift is short as fuck but I still dont wanna go
I never said that is was this Pikachu that's just bad
just saw this emote
I have most of my favorites on shortcut
I don't see what emotes get added every day

you could rename the reward to 'break my splits'
I posted so many weed marios in the group chats for doubledown
especially the angry one
The angry one I just poorly drew on \ / eyebrows
I'll draw angry Weed Mario on my way to my cousin's place today for you Taco
I think it broke
and I ask myself why I haven't finished the art I'm working on
ok time to work kazamsCatglubhat
I was just going to say you should tell them you got that
We did not go to the venue on day 3 whatsoever lol
We stayed home and vegas people showed up
Played a while with grandmaster and him and brett dirty talked in friendlies
ok now I leave tacogu1Leave
hopefully I'll plan better for next major
I don't care about the game too much, I just care about seeing people that are "fake real" but will get to confirm that they're "real real" (REAL)
if this yellow rat said "wahoo" said some gibberish, and wore a blue hat with Pac-Man on it, I'd care a bit more
why's his name Blue if he's not a the color Blue?
I've been conditioned to Blue so hearing Green makes me confused
you were lurred in false sense of hope
alright I gotta head out but I'll be back when I'm on the bus
gl on the run, late misty?
did you miss excellents?
oddish broke out of an excellent?
oh, that makes sense
nothing on rt 2?
oh, I would have caught it still
honestly I would reset now, unless you get a super big
what's you're mashing tech?
of course it went to ad break as you were explaining
yea I'm back, a just heard thumb covers everything
I do index on LR, right thumb a, left thumb b
how tall are you?
ah, so yea big hands
oh I use my left thumb to move on right joycon too
oh no, I never wrote notes for that
no that was plus
it was 16 sp. atk at lvl 6
it goes 14 -> 15 if nuetral
plus atk goes 16->17
yes you should bumps the percentage of catch up 12%
idk if you play Sonic at all, but Tails in Sonic Advance 3 has a butthole and you see it within 10 seconds of loading the game
whats good my guy?
i just just put 4 msgs in komaris chat thinking I was talking to you
I had komari pop out chat over your chat LMAO
i was saying the CT started this year, and around summer of last year was last time I touched it
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KFNo3Mu5pjI6HMim-C5lR8sF6d_U0IdPRWcdGzcPqHA/edit?usp=sharing minus Sp. Atk Pika notes
oh yeah 12 hour challenge pushed me away from lets go
I did astral chain
well add them to yours
I want to make a time table for learning games
i dont have to follow it exactly, but just to have a general idea of what I want
now you dont have to get them later
yeah you can skip magmar KEKW
I hate I went to all the work of making a lets go layout and only streamed 2 "learning" streams
but that was my first 16:9 game
ive never seen sandshrew in the wild Kappa
it's enough to OHKO Starmie though guaranteed
33-34 5/16 35-36 10/16 37+ 100%
you need to arrange the ranges
missing it is basically a reset
oof, komari is on his 10th attempt.Its now or never
well that was quite the time save
10 attempts and he got a trnarrw K OMEGALUL
leaving seaside with a 19:27,not happy about that but playing the actual game is fun LUL
go to the bathroom "oops I forgot to split" Kappa
we are talking about getting a PB but hating the run so you dont split at the end lol
how dare you bismrich the doggo by comparing it to Arbok
y'all got any more of them drugs?
I missed it, wtf did you catch to give a ton of levels?
ah, I thought that might have been the case, but wasn't sure
My Starmie died on Dragonite today so that was fun
well executed you finish post Blaine in 1hr 1 min
that is with same strats
dasb and ninetales do
but youre not in range
There is a way to make your pokemon good that you simply don't do
Sway starmie would just win
BUT YOU GOT ONYX
wasthere even a reason to include mega stones?
I just want megas back in actual games
I want mega banette back
Yea megas for pseudos or legendaries was dumb
But like for mawile and things like that was hype
oh wait! they needed to make the game easier
mega absol was like the angel of death LUL
Are you excited for the kirby game that is just ball fall guys
oh UK gets it that cool i guess
what about me tho?
That's just the one that was on my TL
RF5 on pc tomorrow tho
that's the big release
when is xeno 3
So might end up getting another room at 2dcon
There's blazblue so jibca is coming the whole weekend
And we want to bring jaemi
So that'd be fucking 8 in the current room if buff00n shows up LOL
battle network 5 bugs
meant to google search on trez
I am going to fight this fucking bot
i love lai's note emotes says "hot take"
I think buff00n is more likely to show up after this game list got shown tho cause they have 3rd strike
yeah you have to hover over it with ffz to read it
I open coneys chat and the first message says "Open those cheeks"
It has rained with terrible winds 3 times today and gone back to being perfectly clear
11/16 range on dragonite let's go
i had 131 sp atk earlier it was glorious
Coneys kid came in and the whole chat wants her to PotFriend
Are you gonna pb with this terrible ass starmie
I did miss that range earlier, but I cleaned it up with Rapidash just to preserve Eevee PB
yea 8th, 9th, 10th on the eevee board is going to be 3:05:01, 3:05:02, and 3:05:03
lol, the scariest Hydro Pump ever
who broke the egg
how tall is it?
Both Morph and M4 are live
wait is that a positive nature for spattack too
weedMario 0 SpAtk IV

omg power wash simulator has an update
I watch that game like a hawk when it comes to updates
of course I want to powerwash more things
I have 41.9 hours in it
just waiting to wash more things
joycons not your style?
y i k e s
tho I have smaller hands so it probably wouldnt bother me too much
Would you believe me if I told you this is the first video I ever see of this game?
this game needs to update faster goddam
you know what else is a good game. House Flipper
THERES A NEW MAP YAAAAS imma wash
I am loving those remixes
did you remember to pay your speedrunner union dues?
good idea or not?
streamer I was watching it in their overlay
that's how I found it
just saying how I found it
could try asking Wartab about it
oh duh! you know how to do that stuff LUL
yeah, I saw the guy link you
haven't touched bn5 today so need to get on that
well, I need to go home first
I need to finish playing BN3...
and Jeny wants me to do Mitzi's rando with her
bn5ds is so bad tho
folder edits are fucking God awful
you swap chips with touch
you'll love navi change
basically you can have copies of your team Navistar follow you and aid in fights, you tap you do a navi change. they can randomly jump in for combo atks AND team navis have their own simplified navicust
it's really cool for pvp tho
And you have team attacks whenever the leading Navi switches while in Full Synchro
also you can only have 2 navis at a time
Well 3 with Megaman
and in liberation you get transport chips. so if you play colonel you can swap knight for magnet for the rest of the mission
You can swap Meddy in for ToadMan Kappa
it had some cool idea but the damn menus were aweful
also it take 30 seconds to save EVERY SINGLE TIME
Don't remind me xD
my gba file of colonel got wipe
I think Diamond was my second most played Pok'mon game
and if you have a wiped cart you auto get bass cross on DS with the double slot
@Axl_Sensei BassCross is pretty good
no you get it!
so I have free bass cross
It came to X Dive recently, and I was shocked at how faithful it was to the movie and the game
intended is you need bass icon on gba
I think Capcom did the most with the GBA slot on the first DS
After Nintendo of course
movie is super fun, Lan and megaman do PA infinite Vulcan to break thru a firewall
that's right, Kojima is nuts
Right, Konami had some stuff with Lunar Knights and Castlevania
I know having Aria of Sorrow in while playing Dawn gave you a ring and a Mina doll appears in Yoko's shop
OMG theres ANOTHER level
im living my best life
i washed some big ass statue and now i get to power wash a nasty boat
okay I'm back, anything stupid happen?
oh yesterday went really good
had fun with laichan
went to a driver range in orlando
expensive as fuck too
between driving, food, alcohol it ran us 170 bucks axlsenCoward axlsenS axlsenWut
but I didn't have alcohol cause I had to drive G
next time I'll call Mitzi to be my designated driver OMEGALUL
actually as far as streamers/discord lurking is the closest
we actually met at gdq 2020
pasta is too long sadly
Why do I have to DD? D:
Alcohol may be nasty but with enough peer pressure i will consume it
how else could I trust while intoxicated
We can just use an uber Kappa
Uber for 1 hour driver axlsenS
actually maybe not, Florida drivers would scare poor mitzi
they should be scared of me
) I drive with one foot up on my seat
how do you reach the clutch?
i dont know hwo to drive stick
I keep forgetting you have that roll emote
oh ym god this boat im power washing is huge
camp4r has a roll emote but she's holding up a bag of zenny lol
I dont think so
Mitzi has a yacht POGGIES
I know nothing about boats
absolutely not I hate boats
Mitzi take us on a boat ride fifiShy
lakes and oceans are scary soup and boats go ON the scary soup.
S C A R Y S O U P
Jeny you can have the keys, I will stay on solid ground here with mitzi
yes Jeny can go on the boat without us have fun~
I went fishing once and I have not fished since :) what does that tell you?
Let me bring y'all fishing. I'm a pro
If anyone can make fishing fun it's Jeny sign me up
you have to put bait on my line, you can't pay me to touch that shit
but I dont wanna go on a boat
falling for youngster Timmy fifiBad
my god youngster timmy is a menace
someone call his parents
YEAH ground his ass
Come on streamer! I've seen better gameplay in an IGN review. Cheer100 Cheer100
im gonna save the rest of this boat for when im high
save it for jade jungle
cause high me will appreciate cleaning this boat more LUL
oh my god LUL
LuL Pikachu has its priorities. The berry first
food THEN wherever that draft is coming from
"oh hey, I found this hing in your hair"
you know I wish the rivals were actual rivals and not friendly. Like BE MY ENEMY
I dont want to kiss my rival correct
that sounds like hell
I wanna kick him in the shin and take his pokemon
show em how a real trainer would treat them clintNo
thank you axl phanto274Jam
phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam Axl thank you!!!!!
one of my faveee jam emotes phanto274Jam
my favs are rischJAM phanto274Jam komari1JAM argickJam
now kick him in the shin
yesterday I got a kirby game!!
Ooooh Axl that's cool
phantom ill give you a hint
its a kirby game not played on nintendo
if nintendo is gonna do physical rewards for us collecting points the least they could do is pay for shipping. How much could it b to shipping a fucking notepad!?!?
THE HOTTIE THOTTIE WITH A NAUGHTY BODY!!!
I shared a dank meme in Jeny's discord LUL
I just saw that now Axl lol
Lan, are you... drinking hydrogen peroxide? It says H202! That means it's the sequel to water!
I really hope the bn collection has new humor
I feel like usually the pokemon are spawning like crazy in caves
whats going on game >:(
just saw a thumbnail titled "kirby isnt made by nintendo" and im like, "I cant believe kirby was made by the company shown at the beginning of every single kirby game."
lurking said he got trnarrw on his first fight
i went to his vod
he missed a counter 3 times
the 1 counter he did get raised it to rank 5 KEKW
at least thats my head canon
or it could be melmetal
youtube short: top 5 rarest n64 games - "Do you have any of these?" Me: yup, on my everdrive KEKW
whats a good sky gauntlet? sub 1:20?
what if it was 9% chance that it fails?
you have bad luck with lures
it's a good way to get used to the new controller
you race ill drop 5 subs
@Axl_Sensei do I get the same offer? COPIUM
phantom, thanks for not calling my buff, I gifted 10 to Jeny last night LUL
I might not even join the race LUL
jameike, risch and lurking might tho
where is the game over audio from?
ive never actually asked lol
Phantom Board go crazy
I've never heard of that SpongeBob game in my life
lurking likes the idea of cutscene skipless runs, so I told him to go first
power shock final bowser!!
bot being a chad
did I tell you about the bn collectors edition idea I had?
it would come with 1 key item from each game. bn2 would be a bottle of whiskey LMAO
key items my guy
bn3 would be the hidden key item from number trader
but legit, it would be cool if they included a physical Lan's headband
im thinking of bn1 items and only thing that comes to mind is squirt gun
bn2 whiskey bn3 dads asprine
yeah, bn3 has 81 items but most are data
like the undernet ranks
sounds like that would cost me a lot of channel points KEKW
I could do it blindfolded
we have needle from shellgeek axlsenCoward
theres a needle PA too
BN2 could do the balloon item lol
bn4 can come with a shovel!!
it took risch 4 runs to get to central 2 LMFAO
I have a dalus clip I think you like
still using the hit box?
risch's time is just 3 minutes ahead of you, its basically a race!
YOU FORGOT KEY DAYTA OMEGALUL
he missed trnarrw 50/50
and then missed the 1 in 6 getting refltr
risch only has 1 more hour of resets in him
pc kept going to sleep while I was waiting on emails, so I played one of your youtube vods to keep it active
it wasnt logged into a youtube account so dont know if it counts LMAO
seed 49, that shit was trash
you started with bombette
you couldnt do panels until you got ultra hammer lmao
megaman be zigging and prog be zagging
first run past diveman today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
told risch we got a 35:45 diveman "its not an 'aweful' run" 4Head
you have to consider...
he thinks youre using the hit box Kappa
I have been ok
I have 4 days off work because my station is being quarantined
bruh... if you saw my webcam during your heatman fight....
I took 3 test and they all got negative so I am good
I was legit rocking back and forth laughing OMEGALUL
its better for me to clip for risch then just tell
also clip ran out at turn 3 selection so didnt see it in turn 4
its better that way
you said slot 234?
tomorrow Im going home for half the day so I can actually stream
komari wants bn5, but I havent touched pape in a while
I could do either bn5 is only to numberman rn tho
he just made a comment about your clip
Need to go lay down as I'm a bit tired, but hope you get and draw TrnArrow this time rischSmile
ASMR [Another Shitty Megaman Run]
one thing youll love about bn2, there is only 1 "talk to everyone"
its in scenario 3 at the square
shadow is 3 in bn5 got those mixed up
just to be different/
bruh... these title puns I have in my notes LUL
scenario 2: Mining For Trouble - This Comp Rocks
80% change of Being Cloudy
the clouds in oran and scilab net
Journey to the Center of the Undernet
ive seen fatkid die to that fight
Mother just called on the phone, "What are you doing all day?" thats not me, thats twitch lol
with bn5 im having to break habits
like holding start to skip cutscenes, stretching sneakruns [step counter doesnt reset like im used to] and pressing select to skip cutscenes
also I found out why i kept soft resetting
yeah, I map start to L so I can hold start and B for running
I'm confirmed for let's make big moves are u going to it.. say yes
Jan 6 and 8
u have plenty pf time
so apparently I had a power button mapped next to select LUL
most of the rockman.exe sound box is in japanese but someone song titles are in english like Surge of Power!
but I can read the titles that are in katakana
like with bn5 the boss music is literally pronounced Powerful Enemy but it takes me a minute lol
I mentioned the name bidwar to george for the popup event and he already said to just give him names to put since they can't do the usual thing
So I think I'm in the marathon lol
I should prolly start practicing windwaker but I also just grabbed hitman 2 for 10 bucks on steam
I wanted to get all of them but the site only had a cheap code for 2
so I will just wait for more sales
Cause I already played all of them I just want it on pc
and 2 is the best one anyway
Yakuza goes on sale constantly
I also already donated a bit to the gorescue tiltify since they already put it up
bidwar save the goombario or kill the goombario
people are actually considering N1GP%for bn3?!?
You can also just randomly be handed him
so you can't kill him always
why not have a gutsman% then
reset and get it
PET% time when Lan picks up his PET LMFAO
not with that attitude
its fine, cause bass is pretty difficult that early on
at least id assume its hard
the thing for me is if its a short run it needs skill for me to validate it
or some kind of tech
what do you think of bn2 drop the bass?
Someone came into wariocord and asked how to beat zard as d3
bass isnt even hard just run heatball LMAO
do you know how the ball chips work?
its a slow moving projectile and when hit it absorbs the dmg and once it makes it to the end or hits an object it explodes doing the dmg to each panel on that side.
I'm glad there wasn't a gamble
also remember how busted dash is?
it can destory it LMAO
why is hitman 2 almost 40gb
I have 500 down I was confused why it wasn't installed yet and now I understand loll
Megaman Attack% time when Megaman hits Sunayama!!
i did a soap cake once and felt so unsatisfied
mostly for me it was, "hey ive learned to chapter 4, lets do a soapcake... okay never doing that again"
IL? is that like a segmented run?
NeonWhite I think already has segments for each chapter
And IL's are just displayed in game
persona speedrunners would like to have a word with them
I've watched 6 P5r runs
it was a lot of hours of content
Im more into vanilla P5
I think the current WR for fullgame is 45 minutes
The only IL I've grinded is the one I have top 15 for
The rest I just wanted the medals
I want to get back top 10 for that level
But it kills my wrist to grind that shit
The first second of the level I have to do 3 precise flicks
someone uploaded some videos of a "bn1 ss wr speedrun" that is supposedly 1:27, but there's only video up to the stoneman fight, and they can't find anything else and they are discussing how suspicious it is
Sometimes the floatiness feels annoying in that game but in levels where you have to hit flicks like that I appreciate it because I couldn't handle more LOL
nah, the link is locked. I dont even have access to it.
opinion of stream teams
I used them a long time ago but its pretty useless now
MN smash twitter is just everyone fishing for DN jokes now and I am no longer going to respond to anyone
you hate to see it
last atk being a counter hit
do you know how to say fish in Japanese?
yeah, sakana deez nuts
Phantom I just talked about DN jokes and not responding to people
Now you've been had
@TacoGuyy you gave me the idea Kappa
you will never recover
hey phantom, go to google translate, punch in fifty ten hull and have audio say it in french
or you could just try to say it here... cinquante dix coque
komari forget dark mega fights, these heatman draws is where its at!!!
its content, but only for us
stop posting my credit card numbers
I wanna see if my birth date gets you anything
what if Eguchi's birth date is a hidden lotto code?
could be 16111978, don't know how the Japanese write dates
also I feel that, I also listen to audio cues for lotto codes LUL
Evo is doing restreams rn and there's xrd on and I fucking hate fausts throw
@Komari_ doesnt work in bn5 sadge
He just makes you sit there so long and you just have to accept it
and then he licks you
He just does stupid shit but it's a genuinely top tier character lolll
oh, now that the bn collection is happening I should prob unban the word collection from my chat now KEKW
if it's in healwater that's good enough
I put on multiple write in slots for the strive survey to add more specials
I will get my pin back
we got tired of hearing that topic day in and day out
Depends on what they add for the specials they pick
If they give me back secret garden I would also take that
"what does this chip do?"
Holy shit the top 8 for the evo they're showing is 7 jp and 1 us player LUL
"WHO IS THAT?! WHERE DID HE COME FROM!?!?"
it was on that encounter
cause I wont let you forget KEKW
Man I miss having a good 6k
Strive 6k is so fucking ass
while you were waiting on your next draw I was admiring the sprite work on the flames from heatman's wrists
Xrd 6k was actually a good overhead and got disc and strive 6k is 28 frames and gets me a lustshaker :)
gonna let dogs out, dont do anything stupid
oh shit hitman actually installed when did that happen
ima go shoot people
I wanna see you do the stupid stuff
there's only one grass you should touch
gotta get in on the HackJack memes
yosh, caught a Phantom stream
dog took a massive shit in my brothers room and pissed in there too
have you seen that clip
"Rockman Exe Advanced Collection" [Music player] Contains the BGM of all 188 songs used in the game! You can also listen to your favorite songs in repeat mode or set them as BGM on the gallery screen. Let's enjoy famous songs to your heart's content!
Or I could just listen on spotify LUL
first reply in japanese says... I don't know if it will reach the development department, but I would like to ask you to change the BGM after the final scenario.
I hope rockman unity sees it
I saw "BMG" wonder what this says 4Head
japanese players are asking for the same things as us. even pvp
How's the controller feeling?
Switching mashing techniques is always rough
Like, I can't mash well on keyboard at all
don't you play osu tho? Kappa
In hindsight, I kinda can mash on keyboard
Just not as fast as I can on controller in terms of pure speed
I did always think using a hitbox for BN runs would be interesting, especially for runners who already use keyboard
it seems too expensive for me LUL
Ash calling his pikachu "Pikachu" is like me calling my dog "Dog"... or would it be more like calling my dog "Shiba"?
Probably calling it Shiba, yeah
It is kinda weird when there are multiple pokemon all with the same name, at least in the anime
Gbeast 1 turn again?
Yeah... HeatMan's charge shot hits first and causes iframes sadly
The game told me to make a loud distraction
So I fucking exploded a car
and the guard I had to make move just didnt care and it was 10ft away
Stop with the "there is NO GLITCH" category crap. Anyone who uses a glitch to speedrun is lazy, sucks at gaming, and is not a speedrunner. Saying he "beat" BOTW is like saying someone won the Boston Marathon when their BFF picked them up in a car a mile in and drove them to the finish line. The only LEGITIMATE SPEEDRUN is where someone doesnt use a glitch. And, that one needs to label "SPEEDRUN FOR REAL MEN WHO DO NOT USE PUSSIFIED GLITCHES!!"
Warp whistles are CHEATING
why didnt you vulcan at the end? he only had 20 LUL
right here, sorry stream is delayed KEKW
kekw means im telling the truth
these fight remind me of metaruler streams lol
Hai hai. Speaking of copium. Yesterday was my birthday.
I'm older now. >:I
Or so I'm told.
I had chocolate milk. So, it was an okay birthday.
save 2 minutes? that means a run back LUL
did you check retro tag? Kappa
took 6 games for MegaMan/Hub to be able to hug his mum
look at this Rando Randy weedMario
time for the Rando sNeed
do something else if you want
i dont care as long as its cool
I like traps because its really funny when you talk to an npc and they just strike you with lightning
I'll make you start at Prologue
PhantoBot activated the spell card, Sword and Shield
ive seen coinsanity seeds on yt
So glad to finally catch a stream! been binging your randos on YouTube. love your content!
do traps only spawn disguised as good items
Anti Guy is still looking like he's going to hurl
phanto274Shrug love this emote. l0l
in my personal opinion, on casual playthroughs, he's harder than bowser sometimes. but again, I'm very casual with this game. lol
can't wait to see another use on mystery?
have you checked star summit yet for the star pieces?
I was literally watching your randomizer from two days ago. I'm new to your channel and I'm quite a fan
@inoahhowtoparty same here! phantom does amazing! I'm quite a fan of his as well.
is that a salktydkdan reference?
that's very convenient because I work full time during the week, so I'll be able to catch the streams on the weekend! win win!
I have no idea
should've used that mystery stickshamChaos
what's the worst that can happen?
that was honestly nerve wracking for me. lmao
I would've died 10x over. lol
Beeg Yosh gave you the world
odd key in a odd sNeed
a pure scam artist. lmao
scraping the bottom of the barrel
3fp mega bomb incoming?
Can the frozen pond in Ch7 be a progression item?
3fp powerbomb is good too! that's what I meant. not megabomb. lol
Pog I made it at the beginning
Mario breaking and entering
I couldn't wait any longer!
hopefully its arson guys
I DIDNT KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT
I've died to that big Koopa guy more than I care to share.
i first tried him xd
maybe because I didnt know about him until after chapter 7
place your bets chatters
Just got home from the gym, stomach feels like it's gonna eat itself. Gonna find something to munch on
fuck its mt rugged
this song has been stuck in my head for 2 weeks
my favorite song is toad town docks stickshamGaslight
i like general guys theme
what's the secret to beating those things disguised as rocks?
I always get ran into by them and haven't figured out how to beat them, so I always just run from them.
time to feed gourmet guy?
are you saying you're wanting to skip the best part of the game?
that is one of my favorite parts of this game. his reaction to the cake is so good.
but not after gourmet guy gets fed
are there any checks at Mario's house
the vanilla toy box experience
wait did you get rid of mystery?
The lad and chad
he's got some great Cardio to be running like that. lmao
if believe hard enough, happy flower can be a partner
Kris be spittin fax
flashbacks to when I accidentally solved the color puzzle without the note
so, in a casual playthrough, who is the best character to have in your opinion? like most useful I guess.
a friend gave me a good amount of her alcohol. This is AFTER I just bought some alcohol earlier
I've always relied on parrykarry with his shell shot or whatever.
buff00n go find some Hard Baja Blast
there's actually Seltzer Baja Blast that was made officially
@buff00n that reminds me I have some alcohol to give you
I'm waiting for a few friends to get back to me so we can go have some beers. lol. I need out of my house.
but I am also content right now watching your stream. so I'm happy either way. lol
you must be very excited! that's awesome to hear!
chapter 3 my beloved
this forest took me like an hr to get through casually.
I enjoyed this chapter a lot definitely my favorite
not a clue. lmao. but I did accidentally come across one of them I think.
keeping the mystery for memes? xD!
I really like that part where you hit the 3 switches
idk why i just like it
are those panels in vanilla?
i know where all the hidden chests are in smrpg but thats because i ran what must have been like 50+ randomizers
its open world like paper mario
get back in there goombario
I'll chat for this :)
Leavin the goat FeelsBadMan
SMRPG rando is a lot shorter than pm64
it's a lot of equipment searching, and that can lead to a few party members balling out of control
every boss is randomized and their stats scale to the area you fight them in
ffvi is pretty similar, yeah
and also every star piece is randomized so you could get one after hammer bros etc
but you need seven stars to beat the game
badges have been brutal in this seed andyRage
don't feed the Yoshi's
LISTEN. The last map is really big I can only do like 10% at a time
im playing power wash simulator rn man dont scare me like that
a fellow power wash sim player
you love to see it
its a GREAT game
SquareEnix's weirdest but best selling game so far
it's always the ultra stone
the dev is called, FuturLab
weird that Square of all people published it tho
Coinsanity is really fun in toy box/mt rugged and really annoying most other places
ive played through so much of power wash simulator
I have the best washer and I have not used soap once because im not WEAK
you got all the magic sNeeds
i want MOLES i want MOLES
you instinctively picked that up like a moth to a flame
imagine if you need bubble berry
i want the legendary moles coin
oh nice a tasty tonic you can give that to koopa koot
kill the crayzee dayzee too
they never hurt anyone
He's actively hiding from you
my last pm randomizer bombette had a 1FP Bomb
it started strong for you
the seed for the weekly async was pretty goated
just burn your console at that point
why does mario suck his thumb when he uses a drink item? does he slather the liquid he drinks on his thumb and then drink it? WHO KNOWS?
I lost almost an hour in the async yesterday because I forgot check :)
I still got a 4:16 funny enough
what is the function of koopas having shades in this game
How random has it been
we know in super paper mario they wear shades because theyre hypnotized
Thats not a good sign
bowser hypnotizes his workers because he doesnt want to give them a fair wage
it's a gang thing for sure
No laki and no paracarry thats a little
what do you mean by that
where do you want it?
do I leave Pie-os' message above it?
single white mom in illinois
that is so specific
personally ive never seen one so the bot could be right
so is the bot just random? or what is it there for? because that shit was hilarious. lmao
So that's how the Stanley Parable ends?
the bot is random
Hey look who it is
KEKW well that's convenient
oh hey I have that game
this seed is torture
hey bot, learn THIS
wait so you're saying that your bot... is an amiibo
co-op run, but I'm alone Sadge
20 years from now it will be known as unethical punishment
@rigby235 I feel that. lol
happened to me like last week lmao
If MOLES has million number of fans i am one of them . if MOLES has ten fans i am one of them. if MOLES have only one fan and that is me . if MOLES has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth . if world against the MOLES, i am against the world. i love #MOLES till my last breath
man hot cheetos are so good
im eating some rn
I dont like hot chips
hot things are the best
cheetos are meh. but hot cheetos are fine
Hot Cheetos/Lime Hot Cheetos are good when you don't put them in other things
my burrito will be crunchy
that sounds kinda fire
Burritos arent supposed to be crunchy tho
alright I'm leaving that's actually the last straw
kinda flaming hot, perhaps
i can understand chips on a burger but not a burrito
putting Hot Cheetos/Hot Doritos in regular food is wrong, it's as Shrimple as that shrimpsDrip
Oh have you had fat shack before?
let me just post one of their sandwiches
FAT DOOBIE' Chicken fingers, french fries, onion rings, mozzarella sticks & honey mustard
where's Tacoguyy when you need him?
if you think Cali sucks, don't go to North Dakota. lol. nothing to do here but drink.
FAT MAVERICK' Mac n' cheese, chicken fingers, french fries & bbq sauce
@PerMitzi That sounds nice af
all their sandwiches are wild
that honestly sounds delicious.
ew what did I just hear?
carbs are my best friend <3
All of that with no bacon sounds great actually
I think I'll just stick to pilk thank you very much
shit that fat maverick sounds great
OH how about this one
FAT GORBIES' Bacon, chicken fingers, french fries, cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce & ranch
i have no idea lemme check
is this gonna be like one of your last runs and not find kooper until like the end? lmao
washington, oregon, nevada, colorado, kansas, texas... and more so no they are not colorado exclusive
I never heard of it but I'm in a far off country
on their website they have all their locations
all of their deserts are deep fried
200 S Jackson St Seattle, WA 98104
OH? i see fatshack in your future
I will sub if you find goombario
I will gift if you actually pick him up
goombario is taking some much-needed time off
they have deep fried oreos, twinkies, cheesecake bites, and chocolate chip cookies
If Goombario has a million fans I am one of them. If Goombario has ten fans I am one of them. If Goombario has only one fan, that is me. If Goombario has no fans, that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Goombario, I am against the world.
hes been got got
a deal is a deal
rosie literally NEVER has anything good
I can't believe I spent 2 subs on Shrimpcam and PhantoBot
but they were entirely worth it shrimpsDrip
Why does the hammer make that sound
damn this seed really is bad
oh wow~! a rock!
I got a rock
kooper stuck in a tree poor guy
How many maple syrups do you need
just poor it down his pants
you can fit more that way
you should open the ruins
you're already here no? Kappa
you can trust mitzi with anything (except for anything related to splits)
Strange leaf? Thats uhhh
this guy really just pulls his friend outta the sand
like wow he was just chillin down there
wish someone would pull me out of the sand
2 more checks then ruins :)
trust me, I done this seed
Rigby has done every seed
I'm retired from speedrunning and rando is my retirement home
laki was in ruins Sadge
2CoolJonathan go get em
I had a seed once where I decided to glitch and laki was in ruins basement
so couldn't cheat ruins
turn that frying pan into a drying pan
OH MY GOD BoatRide
I once laughed at it for like an hour
where did you find the piss bucket?
Mario got away with murder
i havent seen any traps
i would like more please :)
i would like more please :)
if I didnt see it.. it didnt count
mitzi has to see it for anything to count
so you better hope she sees you grab the star rod or this rando is invalid, buster
that needs to be a quote
"I'm one damage short"
mitzi does not PikaPls
I have the power to watch
imagine if you had the block that
same. blocking that is the g4eatest achievement one can have in pape
im back what happened
we added a quote thats what happened
you picked up goombario?
phantom didn't block monstar so we are peepoLeaving
he was exploring with Kolorado and got lost, obviously
did you check where the star stone is yet
good I wanna see the legendary item
yeah I'm gonna start doing that for that reason
this fight wouldn't be bad if we started with anyone other than kooper
but ill mega shock the fight if I have access to it
yeah if you start with goombario the fight is leagues easier
it tastes like heaven itself
do I go buy a chicken sammich w/ fries and a shake?
O K A Y
I left for a few minutes, but did you get anything from the 4 or 5 items at the toads inn?
the keys man the keys
hey phantom! what did i miss?
i missed a lot then
did you get a chance to look at the big chest shuffle seeds
you would deprive an old woman of her trusty frying pan???
it is good item lol
officer it's this one right here
what if the pan gives tubba key so it quicker?
tubba key in boo is a trap
frying pan was clearly ultra stone
i would love if they could put traps in shops
YOU PAY FOR THE PAIN
i heard the hammerless start seed of the big chest shuffle test seeds to be quite painful, so maybe not that one
wAIT where was laki
... ruins? i knew it Kappa
i would've pinned it if i was able to lol
slow go spot would be ultra stone
or it would be slow go
it will be slower go
would be funny if you can buy a bomb from shop :)
not sure what's the issue with traps in shops, but clover said to not do it ... yet
or so I've heard
randomized star sprites when?
beating a boss should be a key item if they rando star
one suggestion that could work is decoupling saving star spirits from gaining star power
not like star power is that essential tho
it would be better if the card had goombario on it
if you do another seed can i change the settings up a bit lol
i saw rig do that
we should race a seed phantom. we haven't done that in a while and I'm willing to glitch
those seeds do have the race seetings as base thos
yo cats how are you
good and u :)
I'm doing alright. I might do a seed myself in a little bit so preparing for that
ill try to hop by
no worries if you can't make it. I played the extreme async terribly yesterday so I want to redeem myself
phantom you forgot diamond stone!
no diamond stone was MOLES
did u save baby yoshis
what did u get
if u return a pan u will get a ultra stone :)
if not ultra it will prob be diamond stone bc u dont have it yet
mario likes the smell of the bed
y run? y not just use bow and hide until tubba looses mario
hes not dead yet
this is gonna be close
barely pulled that off
do u have mystery for bowser? it now a key item or u cant beat bowser
dont come crying to me when youre missing diamond stone
fishShy the fuck is this LUL
shy fish is shy
never seen it before lol
I owe everything to MOLES
I love block puzzle
Nice 1 FP Spiny Surge
ima head out bc i got to do stuff
They could do with speeding up this a wee bit
hi i love pape how does randomizer work
oh youre at end game hallway
is soft locking common?
gl with the runs clintThot
what hp does he heal
thats kinda fucky LOL
brain why not work
but yeah makes sense. its like a ratio
hopefully we dont get a 3rd heal lol
yup that's the one
they are not vetted except for "upgrades not 100% vanilla
wake me up when MOLES
last 2 seeds at moles :)
Uh, I'll have to ask Pronyo about stats
While he gave me a crash course on our server stuff ... he only gave me a crash course on our server stuff lol
so is big chest shuffle exactly what it sounds like
thats kinda neat i guess
probably more homeward shrooming lol
the hammers at MOLES
I think the hammerless seed has the highest required sphere count I've seen so far
Yeah I'm still waiting on it being required. But that needs oddkey and bombette and sushie early
opposite of last seed andyLUL
just for you buddy
colonel was a dumpster fire
reset 6 times just to get zenny for 1st hp memory
main comp didnt give me zenny for mine key
so I grinded gmd in oran
then I got to the mine key and was 50 zenny short lmao
dw nobody does lol
yeah the ones before the ultraboots chest
thats really cool boots and hammer is shuffled
icebound and team doing God's work
it's testing seeds. not for the features itself, but for whether we want the sewers blocks gone or yellow or stone
so first hammer is anywhere?
okay so the bust could be super boots maybe
Welp, not partner starved this time
so if this is one of the pracctice seeds I should watch then LUL
I still haven't done 3 and 4 yet
When is the race again?
I'm planning on doing the race
if im home ill do the race
Hmm, I might be calling a Majora's Mask Rando during that.
I wanted to do last week but I fell asleep
We're in qualifiers to our Season 3 tourney right now, yeah
need to getting ready, ill be back within the hour
I want to get into more randos
since apparently I'm a rando streamer now
im slowly getting there
zelda rando are the shit
I wanna submit more randos to events. maybe do extreme rando next time
you should do DK64 rando OMEGALUL
z3 has an incredible rando
we need a BN rando that actually deals with logic. more than just the chips/viruses.
its not open enough
Both Ori games have randos
i actually came from z3 rando. i felt the world needed more randos and joined the pape community then
z3 as in link to the past?
that's the best rando out there imo
z3 or oot multiworld are *chef's kiss*
I did a couple with the intent of joining tournaments once I got better but never did
I also have classic so I mostly use that
I've watched so much Andy's YouTube vods that it's like the back of my hand
I watched a lot of vods and stuff too, I just suck still lmao. I should give it another shot tho
One day I will have 69.42 million phantokens
Wow, early heavy weapons
Wait, I can actually read the game
Yeah it's usually in Japanese
Whoops, yeah the pouches are wrong, I'll have to adjust a local preset I use
Also, what the heck is up with Pape Racers and chests? Toad is showing his RAC like 10 times a week, now you're shuffling big chests
Pffft, I'd have preferred it
you're the first to notice tho
Also great pickup line: 'want to see me shuffle some big chests?'
that is always the case
one thing that's kind of meh with big chest shuffle IMO is that upgrades easily combo into other big chests
it gets spicier with hammerless start tho
can't wait for the first person to have ultraboots but still be hammerless lol
that diamond stone is fake I know where the real one is
yeah yeah, the wall is already removed in our base mod dev branch lol
you can full clear it partially
Lucky 3-0'd the greninja that esam lost to at combo breaker at this regional lol
Imagine thinking mii brawler is top 10 and then it does worse than a pplant
Loaf 3-0'd colorondo nice
Fuck that matchup lol
It's not bad because inkling can't fucking kill wario but it's just not fun
that is a good reward if you didn't know how to do glitches
That's a thing now?
Thirty4 is shitting on this falcon lol
why the fuck did they see him 13th
ive never seen that
Man MN plays all top tiers and good chars but like
They didn't pick any fun ones >:(
Our best 3 players are olimar megaman and wario
The single person who picked fun ones was Violet and he plays joker/sheik
I actually enjoy fighting joker
He's an actually cool top tier and the shit he does besides occasional charizard back air without lag is cool
Pre down gun nerf
That shit was pain
He just got to land
and I had to say ok
Man lucky has a good chance to have to play the person he already lost to at the start of top 8
Plant falcon sounds painful
where did you shove that cake sir
play the slot machine :)
whoever made the tracker must suck they should fix that
Oh also if lucky and loaf win their r1's for top 8 they play eachother
that only happens a few times a week so it's a pretty fresh mu
why did I add it
I'm not gonna remove it
But I'm mad I added it
it's not like we're releasing the next version any time soon, so you're good
they made it themselves
why do people need to ask which twin is which their hair is entirely different now and lucky has facial hair
I return after a nap
but not before acquiring a chicken sammich
If you ever mix them up in person they will just go along with it tho
that is the most annoying sound
@buff00n get me one
If you dislike that sound don't raid jcog
you owe me a chicken sandwich now
2 months I go again
Although combo breaker WAS 2 months ago
MWSF is gonna be lit tho
it's a flip's chicken sammich, not a Wendy's chicken sandwich
We can get another 100 dollars of portillos
we can go even closer to close this time for maximum employee hatred
I don't understand loafs bike usage
He throws it to plat on purpose
where you can never get it again
that is still the one thing I have over loaf
I will just play RPS around my bike and enforce the range where I get + frames
loaf hit a waft string thas crazy
no let me look
I can look at his logs 1 sec
" Master does better than his dick for sexual purposes and I'm pretty sure it wants you there by now" I think that's enough bot logs for now
Flip's chicken sandwiches > Portillo's chicken sandwichs
that is similar to a single white mother from illinois
does coinsanity add every coin in the open world to the pool?
so is big chest shuffle shuffling them between each other or between all checks?
so like bushes and stuff are checks too then
im gonna try one out and wasnt sure what all was in
loaf added another clip to failbots bad waft compilation and lost to the mario he beat at combobreaker
no way he was moustafa the whole time
ill br lurking HypeLurk
Whoever wins between kasmir and thirty4 just wins the tournament I think
Cause either of them shit on skittles
ages ago they said never =(
oh hey ice =P
It's not a development issue
It's a developer issue
yeah iirc you or someone else said that you guys didnt want it
some in the dev team really want it to happen, some really want it to not happen
im working on that ..
im crossing my fingers for the day =P
how else would you know the secret password
Time for lucky to play the same set he lost again
4123 is the passcode for 1-4 in sticker star
i think rando should randomize the bombette clones in ch7 :tf:
I want to take care of just my dog again
do you need to be in a certain state to laki jump
Why does falcon up smash
guess what happened phantom
ill need to look ive been trying to learn more broken stuff recently
same frame and thats it?
My partner swap button is on the cstick because pj64 mapping is ass
So I can't do that shit LOL
ye ive seen the bubble berry one and just never knew it was so simple lol
ive messed with clippy but dont really use it
might start after watching this temple lmao
lucky is planking this falcon with a 3 stock lead
item menu in battle messes it up too?
can confirm from reading source code. very well programmed. immaculate even
oop arctice rolled into plant up smash
he died uncharged at 65 from the floor
Plant has DLC ass moves but then they're on plant
Imagine ganon nair on wario drift
kooper was a sacrifice to the volcano
He calmed it down and you made it erupt
he was looking for his shell
see look it's exploding now
and how would I know that?
thats what she said
extra money? Whats the enchange rate from coins to zenny?
man bingleton coochiesmith lost right after pools
they won a tripoint when I was in vegas I watched it LOL
It was on when I was just playing against buff00n so I put it on the laptop
Ikan was in the chat just saying his tag over and over
sees banjo is trending, "oh cool! what happened?"
Steve Martin does his banjo thing and gets 100k+ likes.
this song is screaming "smoke weed everyday (everyday)"
I'm heavily debating calling in to work tomorrow and not going
I've felt exhausted for the past few days and I felt lightheaded at work today
Yea I just always feel bad when I call in even if I do need it
Although I guess we were out of like any sale item today so the shift wouldn't be bad to deal with for whoever ends up going in
thoughts on speedrun survivor?
Cause at first I thought it was because I didn't eat then I grabbed a sandwich at work and still felt it so idk
oh you havent seen it?
the last person to PB on speedrun survivor gets kicked off the island
I ahve no idea what it is either I'm just saying shit
4thgengamer is hosting it
is that actually what it is LOL
thats basically it lol
4 new runners with coaches
can I run pokepark
well of course! if its josh it HAS TO BE pokemon
when I went to gdq one of my friends introduced me to josh
And I said, "4thgengamer? So you speedrun SNES games?"
jr was in kent c koopa shell

i will go get food also
Ok I got someone to cover me tomorrow now I'm gonna go pass out

u could get it from gifts
goombario is a good gift
luigi is the real kooper
its ruby king this time
did u beat black pit?
u need to go back to black pit and beat it
the ending is great
lil oink rando when lol
u would use it for 1 rando
never seen that glitch before
so the loading zone is always there?
found u from fatguy vid on yt into me searching rando on yt into me finding ur cahnnel and watching 10 randos and then going to twitch and remember to watch u
that nightmare seed vid with the 20k views tho
bad thumbnail = lots of viewers
when will the moment come when you pick up all the coins and star points from running
Im here to bring back old memories...
u missed 1 when u ran
mario still likes the smell of bed
the boo's just have bad timing
wonder how they live... well live while being dead with that
if u edit videos u put on yt u will get more veiwers
bc i would watch every vid but it just takes to much time
yeah burning out is very easy
is there a Daisy recolor?
Wth was that luck
when u can fire?
y is a goomba on ship?
we never had a goomba partner
check moles it gives an advantage in the race
ive been right about moles 100% of the time
i just got behind on some house things so catching up today haha
are the seeds custom made for the race or do they generate them
I'm seeing chat stuff from last stream
@Phantom5800 i love moles
wait, how much FP for Bomb
to my knowledge ive never given any hints that I like moles
feeling fine badge :D
i feel like i know where they are now, it's having to do 5 jumps to remember EXACTLY where they are LUL
so with no hammer seed the bush will never have normal hammer cause super hammer is required to reach prologue
that sounds really rough
how dare you throw away that potato
where are the 4 seeds at in the discord?
@Axl_Sensei toad town, mt rugged, jade jungle, and forever forest
is that just vanilla LOL
the key was in the lime tree
fuck you I was about to make that joke
this rat bastard stole the lime
make sure to get the red jar for koopa koot
now you can see hidden blocks
@TacoGuyy i prefer the term stupid bitch
find some goodges then
what if that one merlow letter is required
was whacking whale added to the rando?
Not much, working on a new pokemon emerald hack
on my first playthrough when I beat chapter 5 I saved and then went to bed and when I got back on my save loaded at the docks before chapter 5 so I had to replay the WHOLE thing
so I hate fuzzipede
Yeah I made Kabutops and Aerodactyl their skeletal forms
Right now I'm working on making a mangrove marsh area
naming a fish sushie is like naming a pig baycon
thank you rip cheato
this is the best shop ever
coconut in a snowy area
im eating ramen so i wont talk for a bit
this is lip smacking good
why is that in the game
looking forward to bot stream
oh boy spear guys
everybody accidentally makes mistakes
they wouldnt be mistakes

without spicy mcchickens because this state fucking sucks
So we're getting mcdonalds when I'm there at some point I hope you're aware of that
Idc what food options are there you've shown me I'm getting a mcdonalds trip at some point
Oh also there's a giordano's in minneapolis now so we could get deepdish at MWSF if y'all wanted to
Don't listen to jesse that place is mad good
go to 4 and do check Kappa
you wont you coward fifiYell
Ok the giordanos is 13m from the venue according to google
So that's a cheap uber if buff00n doesn't come and a short drive if he does
what did phantom ghost have?
I just realized I never paid for 2dcon yet so uhhh lemme do that lol
I made an account for the website but never reg'd lol
You already know who it is, its your boy ererere
none of those words are in the bible
Just some random vid thats in my head rent free
Hows the rando looking
He is a zoomer through and through
Brett told me I gave off "I'm sick and tired of everything and everyone" energy
After I ranted to him for like 40 minutes about that stupid fucking toy story poster
Jesse has been sending me toy story gifs since that
I kinda wanna do another ww run but I don't feel like practicing right now and I need to do door clip
So I'm just gonna play hitman
I tried to do no casualty runs the other day but then I wanted to get all locations on the map and got tired of sneaking
So I just started going around with a shotgun to speed it up
And the map was closed enough with rooms to not die for it lol
My dad got me honey mustard pringles from Israel
I havent tried it yet
I clicked on the bts stream and saw anathema just bounce around with nair gyro and omega's response was rebels guard in the corner
So they died at 10%
Why do you respond to robs kill confirm being mashed at you by going into the spot where it kills you
Ever since he learned he could use emoji's for titles he's been putting out bangers
He has atrioc doing it now lol
Catglub is still like my favorite emote
kazamsCatglubhat he even gets a millia hat
Ok time to be a sneaky guy in hitman until I get tired of going slow and start using the loud shit
Also rune factory gave me multiple fucking cecil cards and fuuka cards and they could've literally given me any other chars and I'd be happy
Just gave me the 2 fucking chars I dont like
I don't even need a scarlet one just give me any cards that's not fucking cecil
pretty delayed pow block you asked for eh?
Forced double-dip chapter 6 KEKW
who gave you editor bot
we need to take that away that's too much power
yeah learning that fortress skip has made chapter 1 a joke lol
he's going to add more fresh
until something is in it, then it's not so funny
The record was in chapter 3 datrut1Pog
Damn fucking broke his ankles
key at moles :)
im 2 for 2
hands havent bothered me in awhile so trying bn5DS
starting protoman with bass cross
oh, i forgot they redid the aspect ratio
lan's sprite looks smaller to me, but I do play emu so it would be diffferent i guess
oh no, the hunt for the last fortress key
oh nice, so I get triple buster, +200Hp, super armor, but -2 megachips
quoting m4 from the discord:
I missed a magical seed or boo portrait (not sure which) and after looking for it for what felt like an hour i just didn't want to continue bc it wasn't fun
m4 forgot about snowmen gift and couldn't find the seed from there
this seed is mean. playing all nice with an early ultra stone, and now this
i got 3 stones on goomba king
went to get frozen custard with a friend, which morphed into also going for a walk with their dog and grabbing a burrito
well 25fp is kinda nice
i just noticed that haha
i need my 3 stones come on
all the worst checks had something of value, and the whole multi dipping left and right at the start, geez
before scilab visit I have 360 HP what is this!?
i don't recall, where was it
great metaphor for the seed, i agree
also ultrahammer before superboots is nasty
i'm all of a sudden not so sad i missed this week's race lol
also getting storeroom key from mt rugged, to get parakarry in the storeroom to enter ch2 lol
would cheating have helped much here? The fortress key hunt, sure, but else?
Where was KBF Key 4?
jade raven was prolog
if it makes you feel better about this seed, rigby lost a life shroom to goomba king lol
Wow, you 4 got up quick
you were both searching the last kbf keys until last
this guy won't die
oh I got an 8 cap on final lmao
granted I had dodge master
ohh right phase 1
I got double 4 phase one
Hmmm, anyone else see something wrong with that tracker?
i'm not ready to watch this again
Just messing with ya
and it has started lmao
can't fire myself really
You know, it makes sense. Megaton Hammer can break bombable rocks, so Bombette breaks hammerable trees
especially not on the playroom tree
So remember when I said earlier how I'd like to see altered item models for traps? For feeling fine, they need to open the eyes to make it look like the awesome face.
the worst is muscle memory of hammering items and then just standing there staring at it instead
you get more opportunities to appreciate your partner's abilities :)
"who needs friends if you have a hammer"
no bomb hitbox, nope :)
that was just the vanilla lyrics with extra steps
i wish i had sick colors for kammy
that could become useful
i would lie if i said i've never seen someone upgrade goombario in a rando, but ..
If I have ultra stone, ill do it for a charge/bounce subsitute on huff/ck if I dont have the badges
and I did it on hammmerless for the same reason phantom did lmao
truth be told, i was refering to the vod of your stream of this seed rigby lol
objectively the right choice to upgrade goombario in this seed i guess
Sushi is just showing how frighteningly slow no hammer is
just you wait for the no boots start where you can't even jump
You just need Sushie for Volcano hammer, right?
i mean, considering we're not doing US raph skip, you'd also need hammer
for the jungle logs
ah. could've meant laki for the lava
You only need one key for chapter one right?
And chapter one tends to be early in logic too so you normally have at least one key by the time you can actually do it
have you completed a run today?
oh nice how'd that go
@spagettd and it was literally for KBF small keys
I still havent seen a full randomizer run so idk how tedious it gets LUL
it's "Tedious: The Setting"
Just for the added challenge? spaget3Hmm
I warned ya, the seed is something else, even if you ignore the lack of B
In challenge do you mean challenge of patience, because that is all it really seems to do
haha I guess thats true
Important, but not useful
I see where this is going
ttyd has a randomizer too or not yet?
there's a few randos for ttyd, but not of the "logic open world" kind
Mario was a big strong man once. Now he is flat as fuck.
TTYD has one but it's not like this
ahh okay, it's not at this level yet
the ttyd randos are pretty good IMO, they just go for something different
It's more like item randomizer and not key items from what I remember
one is for random pit of 100 trials, and one if for chaos entrance rando
Anywho, imma lurk myself to sleep. Have fun psykitPsycho7
Hammerless means we have to do this boss
hammerless means this boss is out of logic lol
Kaizo Paper Mario when. Partners die forever LUL
have you done ch3?
I just took out a 20 person squadron with some soda cans
I don't know what else it could be
and nobody saw me
You can still do record with glitches right?
It's just not in logic though
oh? not a fan
I havent been paying attention
42 minutes in and only that is telling
What are the other checks after this? Calculator and then what?
Maybe just do it later? For your sanity
And that wasn't even in logic
the last remaining check is behind tree near volcano, isnt it
@Icebound777 There is another...
So that means tree near volcano HAS something right?
Or not, but still worth to check
i really hate that we have situations where you can lock yourself out of useful glitches
I did all that work with my stash of soda cans just to chuck a bomb at the target and run away
Oh that's fair, and that couldn't have given laki anyways
nobody saw me still tho so I'm still a stealth god
You can also check Parakarry, you skipped a letter
You definitely did skip a letter
What letter was skipped?
It's on the beach
That's not good though?
And you can't even get to the other letter right?
hammerless might be less painful with gear upgrades in the item pool, but you could still get seeds like this
The Weight could have been good depending on how the Big Chests are shuffled (because that's also a setting)
Sushi didn't even give any progression either
found shrek movie under speedrun tag - was from me, sorry guys
honestly id just be happy to know where the seed wants me to go
That's sad if they made you get the Yoshis for progression
why cant you get pb?
you need a hammer? guess i should know that lol
Well now hidden blocks are in logic if that means anything
uh, tbh i can't recall trying that
Back to Chapter 3 YEP
You can get the Super Boots check too, right?
No you need weight for that
I'm finally giving in and I'm gonna buy FE
I didn't like DNF so I refunded that so I have extra for it
They wanted you to not have fun with this seed huh
may i requrest a short, one sentence review of this seed in the discord afterwards? lol
what happens if you leave through the panel when those nerds come out
If that was ultra boots
yo hammer one hour in let's gooo
you have goombario you already won
There's a seed go tear it apart with the hammer
what's the fp on the quake badges
holy shit I saw mario strikers on the eshop and I like
Entirely forgot that shit existed
Remember when people were begging for it for years and now look at it :)
it's almost like people then realize "oh wait it's a mario sports game it's the same shit every time"
yeah mario tennis aces really set the pace for that shit
when it first released it had nothing and barely functioned
Sucks cause the devs prolly try their best it just gets pushed out by the people in charge
I don't think that's a hot take tbh
Strikers had a top tier wario and I didn't buy it
mario golf wario tho yoshiGasm
I would've bought Strikers but it just felt barren
FWIW Strikers isn't developed by the same people as Golf/Tennis, not sure who's making the calls on the content though
Dude fuckin knives told me to buy golf and she'd play it a bunch and we played it a single time
@TacoGuyy same shit happened with me and Animal Crossing
the golf game is so fucking boring jesus christ
@buff00n AC and Pokemon I just stole from my sister linkusSmart
like i at least had a bit of fun with tennis aces
with golf i just had regret buying it
AC I at least got enjoyment out of due to its release time
He should be taking shots instead because drunk ideas would be more fun
AC I didn't even enjoy because of the time because I had rune factory
a friend was ranting to me about how much he disliked the recent sports games
is he the reason Daisy wasn't in the new Strikers
Doesn't seem he was involved with the Tennis/Golf games
i'd still play animal crossing to this day if i didn't burn out throughout spring and summer of 2020 lol
anytime they'd add new content i'd come back and then realize "yeah i've already put all the time i really wanted to into this already" and just do other shit
Just saw a picture of a group of people cosplaying as adobe programs
2 people dressed as photoshop
The bot met the mysterious loner at the smash local
They probably play young link and that's why they don't have friends
Fuck blocking that poison
I can't do it
Cake was in ch5 though right?
I can't block shit in this game
Can't you just rebuy it
I can only block in ttyd lol
yea i find the block pretty easy i just always anticipate the bite lol
so i never get it anyway
Hey phantom and chat HeyGuys
Coney got sent a lou bega horror game tonight for wheel champ
Lou bega horror game? yaliY
arie found the setup i was just the guinea pig that tested it lol
it's pretty easy once you get the idea
you can just do the jump instead
hey im back my friend is streaming so I left
hes still streaming Im just watching both streams now
you're close it's just precise
I forgot about Super Blooper
is this seed impossible or it's just whack?
Whack is an understated
When super blooper is practically required, it's more than wack
Are you going to do Goomba King?
dont forget hammer bush
One chapter in 2 hours' ouch
why is normal junior here
Thanks for the youtube content
Where was regular hammer?
streamer in pain sells tho
only if you make it clickbaity
"WORST SEED EVER NOT CLICKBAIT"
Nah content is content
use the Coney thumbnail w/ the text "HAMMERLESS ISN'T FUN????"
I mean I think people like watching these type of seeds because of how stupid it is
as a youtube watcher i would enjoy watching this tbh LUL
And also you have the hammerless clickbait
And it can just be called 'I'm never do hammerless again'
you can put something like "even dev says its the worst seed ever" in there, you got my blessing
i first starting watching with the "nightmare seed" video so i'd say this has similar "streamer pain" energy
it's really weird that tutankoopa's only even remote weakness is stomp and even then it's only 60 lol
only one way to find out Kappa
bruh i'm not about getting charged for inflicting psychological pain
You would have more checks and more likelihood to get them right?
tbf, pretty much anything would've made the seed better. early laki, more chances for important items early
I think hammerless is goind to work way better with full gear shuffle. big chests are too restrictive
that is my main issue with it, disregarding hammerless
warehouse key was in toybox?
i mean, the seed can still keep on giving
imagine going out of your way to give mario gifts and he just leaves then there
what's that meme again, with the guy with the crazy hair infront of that map
'Goombario knocks this seed out of the park!!'
His name is Charlie Day I think
"I committed a sin" *thumbnail of upgraded goombario,* there, planned your next vid
the race seed was a sin
100hrs of rando? dang, you're making strides towards my goal
200 hours? You've been counting?
I wonder how many hours I have?
my goal is to make people waste as much time with it, collectively, as ive spent making it
tbf, I look at your camera or gameplay. I don't pay much attention to the items or timer
@buff00n did you remember to say happy birthday to Mega Man X7 today?
but I talked about Mega Man X with some mates, if that's worth anything
for me it's always chapter 7 scaled 4s
i sure hope a gdq run doesnt look like this LUL
abandon the run if they try to surprise you with Hammerless
Should you do ch5?
im here full time now
blue bow looks awesome
ive never seen that skin
FEW is still installing I hate the switch's internet chip
when you have 500 down but the switch goes at 3mb
You got OG FEW?
I played the old one a year ago
Cause I got it for like 10 bucks at a local game store
shit was omega clearanced
who cares about go mode when you have goombario mode
why would they give you anything after the best partner
Was gonna say you should because it'd be funny but this is good youtube content so maybe don't do that
what do item pouches do
"This seed STOLE my hammer!?!?"
This seed TOOK my KIDS!?!?
Can't have shit in detroit
I found a melee set that I actually like
I thought so too
Its Chango vs Fuaxhebro at BoBC 3, its because Chango just only played for time
And I like that
tho I can't promise you'll be safe from TacoGuyy
but camping is LAME. Melee's supposed to be COOL.
Didnt melee players try to ban timeouts on more than 1 occasion?
@1STSTAR__ I can promise you'll be safe with other TacoGuy
Other tacoguy is best tacoguy
Puff was killing the game. Apparently.
Ledge is dumb af in Melee.
Why's ledge your advantage state
Are there any puff players besides hbox people get mad at?
Its funny, even with all of that shit puff wasnt even the best in the game
Hbox is the only Puff that won shit, so I want to say no
Its like ult steve to a lesser degree
Or a greater degree
Because melee puff is uhh
my melatonin is hitting me hard i think im gonna go to bed
In conclusion people dont like lame
or figuring out counterplay
You see fox is cool so armada did nothing bad
it's cool when Fox does it. it kills the game when Puff does it.
Counterplay discussion always gets drowned out by the "this character is lame" discussion
phanto274Jam just in time
I like that emote
I'm tempted to sub for that emote
phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam

Is it possible for an item to unlock a chpater to be in that chapter?
What even are fuzzies?

SOMEBODY TOUCHED MAH SPAGETT
I HOPE SHE MADE LOTS OF SPAGHETTI
I told my community about how cool Paper rando is random239Comfy
What about dog island phanto274Thonk
Dog Island is how I found your channel HypeLUL
A proper send off
... didn't we already see the palace key
1 minute until new years
The most menacing castle
happy new year PogChamp
I accidentally killed petra woops
I wanted to play her but I don't want to do the map again so oh well
I got Hapi so it's fine
I feel like there's no point to playing on classic if you're not down to just say "woops"
Except if felix dies
He is staying on this playthrough
He's fast and he's my favorite
I need him to shittalk everyone for me
moles is gonna have it
Casual is good if getting into the FE series but you absolutely need to start accepting losses if you wanna dive deeper
Go check it first and if I'm wrong I'll gift a sub
No I mean if you don't have it after palace
when you go into fields
Is a giant nit
My fucking fingers LMAO
at least I dont have to gift
see, wasn't that a fun seed
I think this setting should stay in dev hell
just say "whoops it broke or something"
Look man Mario is tired
and people keep asking for jumpless seeds
people deserve to be locked away
who wants to not jump cancel a spin
@Icebound777 who are these masochists that want to see the world burn
Damn black crystal king
Thats so cool looking
you can traverse surprising amounts of the game on the lift parakarry gives ....
like i don't know either lol
hammerless, jumpless start, shuffle quizmo into the pool, make the toybox slot machine have progression ...
oh god the oinks
I say these would be ass but I've played fullsanity on windwaker with all the pain checks so....
treasure charts should never be turned on NOPERS
Having a nice frosted cookie and doritos at 9:14
and sploosh kaboom almost ALWAYS has something because it's sphere 0
Feeding fish has no progression or item
I dont care lol
Windwaker rando is fun with race settings on
Because that's just chests and dungeons
And glitches don't get banned for WW races
because SD is piss easy
I forgot what Tubba's actual color is
It also mods in the swift sail and with SD sail pumping it goes absurdly fast
So superswims are just not that much faster lol
I would say tomodachi life rando but that game is already incredibly ranndo
He doesn't play any games that'd be interesting
gacha and smash bros
I hate that you're right
I dont play gachas I play a gacha
that was the default
couldn't be arsed to change it
At least she got taken out by the goat
I was gonna say that I play the gacha because it has my favorite video game ost but thenI was timed lol
Def not love live
yea put hi back
he can serve the 10 minutes
How can you play that many kirby games and say a gacha is the best ost
yeah, he can stay there
I've played Heroes, but I never put money into it
Pallos prison will always be occupied
I've not played arknights much I usually opt for bloons when I play a mobile game so I've not put money into it
every free roll did nothing but depress me. Why would I pay money for that.
Dusk hasn't been on a banner so I haven't cared to even roll in arknights yet
My favorite Terraria mod for whatever reason is officially partnering with a Touhou gacha game
Oh yea I saw that
how the hell does a mod officially partner with a completely unrelated party
@TacoGuy74 we should play terraria again
It's the devs partnering not the mod directly
@buff00n Their reason was community overlap
@TacoGuyy Have you ever played calamity mod?
I've never played modded terraria
I think it'll be up your alley
wtf is that attack
I have never seen that
5+ 2 per ruffpuff
saw someone on twitter named mercedes is gay
One of the songs in that gacha is the reason why Im taking music production classes LMAI
But uhhh hows the weather
@TacoGuyy I mean. She is.
Is it time to beat bowsers ass
saw someone on twitter named wehave2bansteve
I've a friend who chastised me for making Mercedes a dancer. Said she was too pure hearted.
oh wait its onin
Mario, we present you, a crib
a stylish flying bathtub
there's a blanket and a pillow in the thing
its like the cars bed of bathtubs
How does she live after you know, exploding
*Meta knight victory theme plays
You mean to tell me this disastrous seed will have a disastrous ending
Can you power shock final bowser
Oooooo pink star dude
That is pretty funny
My wario amiibo gave me a steel tome
What does that imply
so i can come to you when i have those jumpless seeds yes?
The seed of all time
I forgot how good the tracks were here
MMBN just has jams
"Hey ice learn this game, there's a 30% chance the run lives"
SPEED STRATS OR BUST
Was 5 the only one that has the turn based thing?
I actually didn't like them lol
excuse me sir this is an E rated game
I love that sound bit LUL
Play what you wanna play tho
After rando assaulted me with last location every seed
I kinda don't wanna play it right now LUL
The first and only seed I got
The tutorial mobs were Yurts
And I was like
And lemme guess they didn't scale them to the area
that sounds like some nerd shit
I'm back with wendys
So Multiversus def got better but idk if it's enough for me to really consider it for a side game over strive
Also the netplay was a travesty with the server issues today
First rollback game I've played where if it rolls back your inputs also get fucked
Because it kept throwing me off stage
It was consistent for the last 2 hours every game rolled back at least a little bit
Where the first hour it was butter
I won't be touching 1v1
I think tilts on the ground would do wonders for gameplay
My 2 big gripes are how much the top tiers just swing and that's their neutral you can't contest and that the punish game isn't cool outside of the trap shit
Me and jesse did some bullshit with projectiles and rocket but most of the shit is just up air down air still
Even then Dan made a good system around his limitations and balanced around it
I have been saying this at people since the 1st beta but whiff lag should be different than on hit lag for a game without a shield
Rivals 2 looks so fucking good
I need a beta for that this instant
actually give me a beta when they make Sylvannos
Then give it to me that instant
I am waiting for them to show Kragg
I wanna see what bullshit dan gives kragg this time
Eli was very bad at first
She's been buffed a shitton and has some stuff now
Yea I could never get around handling her air shit
I just played Ori and Sylv and idk if they'll put Ori in 2 so I will just play Sylv
Genuinely a top 5 fighting game char for me
Sylv was there before they got nerfed and changed but they're still close
I'll mess with multi again in a day or 2 tho when the servers stop being how they are
I love that nintendo is specifically removing fates first from the 3ds
They know that shit was bad
You just need conquest for the gameplay and then skip every cs
But hey if you marry them THEN you get a letter that says you're not fucking a relative :)
Look corrins step sis just got stuck
What else would he do
I was gonna book one of the twins for metafy just to review some shit but their availability times are so ass and random
I still wish we got to stream anything while in vegas
Their internet just genuinely didn't function at ALL that week
Bear bought a new router while we were there lol
But yea a cox guy came in on the tuesday and plugged in a cable that just wasn't properly plugged in and the internet worked well
Oh it still ass for the twitch side but it actually functions in their house now
It genuinely just shut off for hours when I was there LOL
And the cell service is ass in their downstairs
So if I wasn't in my room I couldn't do anything LOL
I also have a high tempo shit when I see sonic 06
It goes faster than the game loads
Why did buff00n put fat mario dumpy on my timeline
I'm still pissed I had to pay 10 bucks to play reindog right away
I simply do not want to play any other character
Training mode does let you play any char regardless of owning
So they have half of that
Jesse got bugs in like 20-30 minutes
This doesn't look as bad as liberations
Yeah the sad part is, 5 turned me off cause of liberation, i never even bothered playing 6 :(
Also been considering my emotes
I like the RF ones but people don't use them, I think I may get them done as oshawotts to keep it consistent
People generally just recognize oshawott better and like it better so I think it'd just be better even if I like having raven emotes
But yea I'd just be getting tacogu1Ban and tacogu1Bless turned oshawott
maybe I'll re-commission the mash emote eventually too but I tip high for animated so I wanna be able to do that before I get it
That's one thing that I super loved about trusty's style
Currently tho the raven emotes are on bit slots anyway so I'll prolly just move tacogu1Eugh down to 1k so people actually have it and fill my animated slots first
Cause I fucking love tacogu1Eugh and I need people using that shit
my mom just texted me a gif of wario falling down a hole
it doesn't restart either he's just dead
why did she send me this
"why would you raid me"
to let the viewers watch someone better than me
uncle ben what happened
mostly just following route without live timer, before shadowman I died and never saved cause why the hell would I save? Then came back to cloudman. That was 4 and a half hours
was trying to hold out for jeny's stream , never raided her but it was getting late
and starting today Im trying an actual stream schedule
ill just copy my discord
First ever real attempt at a stream schedule. Gonna be trying Tue, Thu, Sat, and Sun. Tue and Thu will start around 4:30 or 5pm EST and need to put more thought into the weekends. Fridays will be more of a "If I Feel Like It". So gonna try this out for a few weeks and see how it goes.
bro if I could stream rn Id be streaming for like 10 hours a day rn. I miss it T_T
I, hopefully we, miss you too
sundays are a given 5pm est because... reasons OMEGALUL
Hopefully soon T_T I am ITCHING to be back at it
you what i hate. Time zones
i want universal time and i want it to be mine :)
I would work on sundays so the race was impossible
Mountain time for everyone
then one sunday im like "fuck it" I called in to race. Then next day at work I found out it was a holiday and didnt get paid for labor day
It was great the week I was in Colorado last year. Hated coming back to est
colorado is shit... but I have a legit reason
not many natural disasters to worry about, weed, its dry so not much humidity too
My last job was called Colorado Boxed Beef LMFAO
so yeah, THAT colorado was shit
Is that like Omaha steaks but worse?
if you grew up here it aint bad :)
I AM ALTITUDE TRAINING WHILE SPEEDRUNNING Kappa
altitude training while sleeping
oh phantom, do you wanna join anime watch party with Mitzi, Jeny, and me? We start Monday
Bakuman, they havent seen it
yeah that one ^
sit in on the first ep then decide
ok axl we watch bakuman then you have to rewatch onepiece with me Kappa
I can watch a few with you rn if you want
let me get my HHD then
so these runs are pretty dependent on encounter rng?
@PerMitzi mitzi, I have the first 950 eps archived from fansubs lol
yeah, I watched it weekly for like 12 yyears lol
oh phantom, with regards to bakuman. Its by the same creators that did deathnote. Its a different genre but still a wild ride
yo komari, phantom asked me to check in. What should I tell him?
let me trty that again
the category is called BeastSP so didnt what you to think he was done OMEGALUL
after Bass is it just run to gregar?
why would you need it anywhere else
Imagine dying to BassBX but still golding
oh, he is working on PA list
Felix is 10 levels above my other 3 units currently
he is simply the only unit I need
I may or may not have discovered you from looking at the Limit Break submissions and saw you submitted pape
and then realized you are the one that made the tracker
I'm submitting super pape myself to limit break and pace since it has yet to be in an in person marathon at least Any%
paper mario block at limit break would be cool
up to you in the end
I submitted a few things myself
FF1PR FF2PR and Z2
Gonna probably submit Jets of Time rando too
I can't justify another vacation lol
I'm going in person if I get in
and Utah is 2 states over
We can just make glenn pay for all our food at MWSF to save you money
I remember when P5 was 16 hours LUL
the accounting teacher LMAO
If you see a notification on discord, ignore it. I accidently tried to call you lol
but then you have twins for that hot Mari on Yuri action!! phanto274Thonk
Do you think Higsby ever had a chance with Mari?
what are you talking about
I didn't finish the run
vod dosen't exist so its invalid Kappa
Should I keep playing FE or should I start a ww run
I must get good for the doggo charity
rather back to being good
Hello raiders. Welcome to phantom's stream. We play with megaman - I mean play games with - I mean we play megaman games. Also we live to play with your Forbidden Memories, we have a !slots that never gives us what we want, and we fondle our pads and press the right buttons. Welcome in.
i don't blame them
Honestly I just want to have a <2:25
I techincally have one if rng didn't exist
super swim is stupid
I played for a 2:22
I think like a 33 or something with 8th try pg skip
I think I have a 32 but that one didn't technically touch a portal for a frame so it's not valid
Skipping him saves fucking 3 minutes I can't avoid it >:(
If I was warm I could 22 without it
No if I get a pacer to that again I am deadass fighting that fucker
I just have to practice phase 1
For some reason tho I'm warm on literally every trick still except door clip
I hate door clip
i you want top 10 times jsut run BeastSP Kappa
why in the retro category rather then mbnn
Give me a manipless cat, and I'll run it for 2 or 3
But bubble man is a dick
legacy collection will probably help when it comes out if everyone just streams in the category
Just do the frame perfect aqua manip
Yeah, I sadly doubt there will be a legacy collection category
he tried so hard but he cant do that
I am sure if someone ask nicely we can get one
just tell terra we want it Kappa
you forgot NT too
Also learned streamlabs was what caused all my audio issues with WW so my choices rn are blue screens or bad audio LOL
I gotta choose blue screens tho because I need audio for this game lol
Yea but I'm lazy
So I just gamble it each time I close it
I didn't crash today
Shit I clicked homebrew and not haxchi
We have booted the wii u in pasta mode
We have achieved italian
I'm unhappy with living
Isn't there someone you forgot to ask
Ok I first tried the swims I failed and hit my roll clips I think I'm good
Time to miss pause storage on the PG cutscene
ok lurking no audio cause stream lol
DM'd something for you to laugh at later LUL
game boy is a tag!?
theres a guy streaming valorant under game boy... MUST BE ONE HELL OF A FUCKING PORT 4Head
then dont lose gavel skip next time
Baja Blast Sword stickshamRiku1a stickshamRiku1b
we gonna see elecswrd diveman phanto274Mash
It's just Ice Buster Sword now but I'm freezing Baja now and hopefully it doesn't make a mess/explode
we running a new SSD lets go!!
5? its 6:41 my guy 4Head
do it you coward
also I invited cats to anime watch party
"like I'm sort of videogame star, in their 6th hit installment?"
best quote from this game
I love komari is taunting the diveman runners
i just dont understand what they see in it
at least do segmented runs
I dont mean to come off as elitest but if its too long pick a shorter game
a series called seven deadly sins
im just so disconnected from the community now, between the casuals flooding discord, the speedrun posers, hell I even removed myself from the stream team.
Before I did that I looked over the team, I counted like 8 people that havent even streamed since risch joined.
yeah, keizaron is still on there LMAO
I do too! I subbed to him for over 3 and a half years, but taste change over time. Still a super cool guy tho
ironically, we had a bn marathon and keiza is what got me to pick up bn2
was cool that I met him at GDQ and got to tell him that in person
you gonna submit if it pbs?
I had a ton of PBs in exe2 i never submitted
it didnt change the placement so I held on to it
wait til trnarrw fails KEKW
yo im so happy
god of war comes out 1 week after my birthday
meaning no one can get me the game I dont care about LUL
I need to practice everything
does the charge shots make counter timing easier?
I thought you were doing it as a buffer
jugoomba has 15 minutes on you, thats blastman and ice box!!
meant to capitalize "and"
yup, never doing that again
15 minutes, okay you can start your timer over now KEKW
its a handicap lol
remember when i popped in your stream and said, "WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO YOUR CIRCUSMAN!?!?"
hot take: cheating should be allowed at gdq cause its just a showcase anyways
argickFine fifiFine grimmy1Fine kjoeraALLFINE komari1Fine
we gonna see prog destroy 3 heelnavis?
starting to hate lotto codes
thats the worst i can do to my hands
i just got to the point where i can play ds lite without issues
casual viewers, "oh dang he messed that fight up" bn runners, "LMFAO nice fight bruh"
oh? you are using the category
mine hit 9 yesterday
yeah, did have a small raid from rigby
i missed everything yyou said after rigby raid
I say I dont care about growth but thats not entirely true. Its more I dont want to do extra work for growth. If I really didnt care I wouldnt share my go live in other discords
my drive for bn2 was the leader boards, growth took the back seat to that
I wont say it was a waste cause I legit enjoyed it, but I really dont care about bn boards anymore
I need to unblock the word collection from my chat still
dang, Pape get a massive graphic upgrade
how hard is it to memorize the ghost stuff?
its easy after the 2nd time
i know you dont blame me. Around 2 times a week id have someone ask about what I thought of a collection. I got sick of it LUL
blocking it was chaotics idea LMAO
I still have a command for it too
welp imma sleep gl with the run!
"capcom devs know you want it so STFU [with a link to a protodude tweet]"
last scenario in bn2 my notes say, "clear apartment comps"
btw, how much trouble did that give you?
even if you have maps open it still hard to figure out
yeah, the random warps can take you from area 4 to 1, back to 4, fix the warp, then that takes you to 3. Casually its a mess
I sent this to komari lol
the boomer fight and then it stops right when you miss heat press
Komari: OMEGALUL the timing at the end
nah, its funny as is
actually in bn2 its 1321333231
its easy to remember, its 1 then 321 then 333 then first 3 backwards so 231
you have a better way to remember netopia gatekey?
one time dalus asked me for the quiz and I told him 123133322132
so he got all of them except for the last one LMAO
here from No glitches allowed discord. Good luck with the runs! songof8Hype songof8Heart
WE DO DO GLITCHES
so prism is allowed, got it
All the games I run have glitches and I love glitches but I joined the no glitches discord for the emergency event
I hope you get in! did you submit megaman??
you should sign up for SDAT
im sorry but everytime I started waiting a dog island vod id think to myself, "id rather watch something else... like anything else" 4Head
I submitted a few unseen runs so hopefully they make it in, I enjoy seeing games that don't get love they deserve be shown in the spotlight
more than double team DS
i have to laugh irl
what a chad fifiCard
fifi opens pokemon cards, so makes for a cute emote
yeah thats right, short for firedragon
I've never seen this run before, but I'm really enjoying the run. This game is visually pleasing
totally, BN hasnt aged a day
heatman is such a cool navi, he gets a pass
did you fight him in bn2?
movin fast on those skates and even using stairs songof8Speed songof8LOL
his heat stamp makes your panels lava
@dwhite1023 OST is definitely a banger so far
if you clean those folder edits up, WR for sure Jebaited
komari's toadman emote is gone
the animations in this game songof8Heart
I've been lurking since you went live
songs, check out the chip artwork
@axl_sensei ill check out the art for sure I'm a sucker for game art
is that robot corn?
the one time i ran this game my sky gauntlets was flawless
the more I watch the more it becomes a fever dream songof8LOL songof8LOL
megaman just turned into a xenomorph while fighting airplanes
@SongofSoil if you like art I cant recommend this enough https://amzn.to/3aRy282
i have that book, it's awesome
170 pages of battle network art work
@axl_sensei added to my cart for this payday. I just got all my collector books for berserk in so this is another item to fill my shelves
theres one for megaman zero too
I have this one for x
Mega Man X: Official Complete Works HC https://a.co/d/9u8olsj
phantom do you have the BN complete works?
im curious to see what art is in legacy thats not in complete works
want to see some footage of sol cross, guy gets an encounter and immediately uses search soul... nice showcase bruh
why is wario in the pit
Did you know Protoman will never remove his boots?
Just saw someone tweet that they should revert all base cast nerfs to compensate for steve and like
I think they forgot about megaman
is it moneyhatz yet?
Mark's title is "Ive got no more dinks to give"
my bad for using your emote wrongly
when phantom streams the wise cracks just happen
when I stream, "that was bad" that couldve been optimized better" "I hate everything"
just do PERFECT CIRCLE
you know what you need?
i love how its a literal F-Bomb
the only reason I had the idea is cause ice fight in den3, you actually get timebom2 F KEKW
what we feelin now
I saw that gold sitting at a red light lol
Mans saw that face
and only looked at green
the other day komari called me lurking lmao
so i was on mobile, and I have no idea how to bring up chat settings. It just happens randomly sometimes and as I tried to close settings it turned to blue LUL
SkeletonPls wait this works better
he stole the bean
kill him this instant
Tk is tweeting that the servers are still dogshit for multi so I guess I won't play that tn lol
think mean with an R, you were overthinking the pronunciation
just learned a very very important thing about bn5
in liberations if you get invincibilty with shadowman you cant antidmg
glad I learned now
when to fight cloud and couldnt do any dmg
was that a clip?
imagine running a game with a loading screen
It really dosent lol
Good luck on the runs
Jhawk LUL I thought you said Jcog. I did a double take KEKW
I get that a lot lol
Also everyone thinks I'm a guy clintBaka
Masculine presenting twitch name lol
i learning if I want to run bn5 I need to get better and fast LUL
im sure it had a good reason
How did Link win the basket ball game?
HE USED HIS HOOK SHOT!!! etchyLmao
good games or bad ones?
I hope one is boktai
"goes running to komari"
it wont let me clip you saying you got FM
here we go again
you and risch are doing resets you know what that means
I swap whenever you guys reset KEKW
didi you see the goombotio seed logic today?
weight was in the well
so he needed all seeds
It was interesting to watch this morning
sushie and kooper were last too
Sounds like you should be playing a Paper Mario rando instead.
This is the only time I've ever cared about LeBron James
I can understand it would probably be too mcuh to get real LeBron
Now all I need is Godzila and my meme team can be complete
This is that good rng
phantom, got a question for ya
found one of my socks in the backyard, guess how it got there
GG congrats on diveman% Kappa
I started reading Reggie's book today. Really enjoy it so far
when fight colonel if I draw double shot ill use it on the top or bottom giving him a less chance to stay in the back
get on their level, Ive seen dive% runners with 400 attempts 4Head
tomorrow im returning back to rando, its gonna be something relearning everything again lol
I didnt intend to copy you, my rando are like 6+ so I need the extra time
pretend you didnt notice it was 100
who would you say was the first gaming chad? For me Chunky Kong comes to mind
try bn2 then tell me how you feel
would you go GBA or DS?
ADD is so bad, you dont skip bad chip, you get 5 more next turn, then your next turn youre back to 5 again.
bn1 buster only isnt bad tho
I love soul, its just a shame its not used in speedruns
I dont remember how good the souls were in 4
in 5 tho magnet was way up there for me
can charge elec chips, charge pulls target to the front then hits, <--B freezes them to panel like how magnet bomb worked in BN2
its great for windbox
Hey @STREAMER, you've been live for 2 hour(s)! Have you been drinking your water? It might also be a good time to get up and stretch, refill your water, grab something to eat, or maybe take a bathroom break! Stay Healthy!
why would you do that!?
is turbo allowed now?
but I get it for bdsp
whats your opinion on liberations?
I like them until I get to cloudman MonkaS
its not super hard, just gotta keep the antidmg rhythm
cats is getting trolled by a gold daisy OMEGALUL
I wanted to try out the diddy kong rando but after watching a vod it doesnt look interesting
shuffles vehicle, item balloons, and course loading zones
yeah im interested in oot rando, but dont know anything about vanilla
I wouldnt know how to setup WW
what about prime rando?
Ouro [my emote guy] used to run prime rando
I watched kirbymastah do it too
still blows my mind how much kirby has done
metroid, sonic, wario land, like the only english FE runner lol
we got to navicust HUZZAH!!
dirge posted a clip where he just airshots dark mega to death OMEGALUL
1K HP, how good is your mash?
seeing people excited for switch online releases, "dude, why dont you just buy an everdrive?"
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
still better than the drip feed
hot take- SPM was the last good looking PM game
the white outline is so bad
then you have "fans" making Pape with "HD assets".
Ill admit at first I thought it looked cool, then I started playing pape and yeah now I hate it
the art for goombario looks he has [text redacted] [text redacted]
can diveman only go to center panel and corners?
cause if he moves twice?
and he cant move backwards
I mean forward then back
i'm doing good how is the run going?
when do you think you will do a pm rando?
been watching it very cool to watch
been trying to catch up with the rando's
sadly i lost your 50th run
is he skating or walking?
you still havent traded battle chips with me fulliePout
that was the only pout emote I have
if they do I hope you get it on PS
seems like most are getting it on switch
if I play on switch I can use my pokken controller as I always do, but PS5 will force me to use the dual sense
trophies are more important to me tho
I still want to get a switch copy just to have it
yeah im "one of those gamers"
I dont have steam on this PC, I just dont buy enough from them
My old PC is right next to me and could get it if I really wanted
my steam is sonic 123knuckles, and monopoly OMEGALUL
just remembered you had it
brb havent eaten anything today gonna warm up a burrito
oh noooo i'm sorry haha
i legit spent like 20 minutes trying to beat general guy and i made some mistakes but it is what it is
i thought colonel was right after blast/dive
oh wait thats GBeast
I always mix those up
welp, no season zero with komari tonight
cant wait for monday watch party
like there are 2 tags for bn6 alone
seems we're getting closer to BN3 SS
time to unfollow then Kappa
watch him said to 450 tomorrow 4Head
is there time save in boss rush?
that's exactly what I thought
elementman just screams encounters to me
you probably got at least 2 in mr weather comps too
yeah 2 is average for JP
This Stray mod turns a meow into the 'Jason' scream from Heavy Rain OMEGALUL
I wanna see them mod in spider cat from miles morales
Rando Randy's are real
uggh phantom where's the multiverse at.. start playing the hotness
I paid for it
it's fun just like smash lol
I played my first rando like 2 days ago
I found one of the magical seeds and for some reason I just left it there so I had to go on a wild goose chase rechecking everything to find it
I also had to learn about the extra forever forest checks and desert checks
but I used your tracker so that helped
I played with letters on which is fine for me because I like letters
imglowRIP in a bush?!?
I know where a few of them are but I dont wanna memorize all of them
I wish I had a setup to play' wife and kiddo > my gaming time'
yeah whoever said to use bizhawk is a saint that runs paper mario wondefully
damn I didn't gamble
come into chat and first thing i hear is bizhawk praise, based
chapter 1 is always either chapter 2 or chapter 7
chapter one was 7 in my seed
I'm at work so...
I completed 2 koot favors for the silver credit so I could get more money
did not get good items
It was a very shop heavy seed so I needed the silver credit
one of the worst roadblocks for me was not having kooper
I almost ran out of checks
get this I had to complete chapter 3 to unlock rowfs items and one of those was kooper
I thought he was gonna be in tubbas castle because I only had 2 keys but the third key was on the big table
I actually forgot if I turned panels on or not because I generated it the day before I played it so I checked like 5 panels and thankfully all star pieces
the last thing I wanna do is memorize panels
strange leaf was in merlons house for me
I could have had a way early chapter 6 if I didnt miss that magical seed because I had literally everything else for 6
I killed all 3 bloopers looking for kooper which was really tough because I was only like level 2 but 1 fp power shock wins everything
didyouknowgaming put out a pokemon video, at the end I noticed Eurasia helped translate some stuff
I was just asking lmao
i hate hitting trees
GL on the rando!
which paper mario item do you want to try in real life the most
I was thinking more food items but that works
imgaine having irl fright jar
use it on the cops KEKW
nah, who am I kidding
im saving it for Mitzi fifiBad
knowing her tho, she would just dink axlsenWut
irl dizzy dial use it on the highway
Well this seems pretty standard so far. Chapter 5 first-clear?
ever done a ch 6 first?
I'd want that too
spear guy had 9 hp
38 min in and not go mode yet. pls go faster
I was expecting some dinks
I know what 75% means in this game
the last key is only there after you exhausted all other checks
general guy is scary when you don't know scaling
woah green pyro guy
why can you equip all your badges with 12 bp
gl on baby seed ThankEgg
2 fp fan smack Kreygasm
but you can use it to sneak past clubbas
rando but you have to use everything as you get it
I asked Morph about using a fright jar on him. he said dink cause its a garbage item that never works LUL
I know a thing or two about fright jars
mitzi said, it depends
God I'm doing glitchless soon, can't wait to dink
Me: "it depends" my favorite speedrun answer
how goes it :3
I laugh everrytime I hear risch say that
"unfortunate" says the man who has 1 bp costs across the board
everytime I say fuck no im always right
Buy followers, primes and viewers on mystrm .store
come back when decide to tell us to mount our viewers
he was doing his best
whyd you ban that guy I wanted to get some followers
'"will I get TrnArrw?"
Buy viewers, followers and primes on yourfollowz. (com)!
Buy viewers, followers and primes on deeznutz. (com)!
EXE3 is sooo close!!
hope youve been learning varswrd
with a hitbox sure!
"you just press the buttons"
you have 45 frames to hit 5 buttons!!
that can be said for ANYTHING
that sounds not hard
jokes on you, I can only press 4
B left down up B
but in the heat of battle
I can probably do it :)
laki in ruins. calling it
I struggle with tri slash
and that s just B left B right
well sure, if youve played fighting games
make sure to equip slow go for this room
I hate this guy
rip cheato is a thunder mage
if someone found my lost pants I also would reward them with a cocnut
i spelled coconut wrong
now I have to call coconuts cocnuts
hey whatever you say man Im not judging
Hey phantom and chat. phanto274BLANKIES
my 2 year is next week
thank you. this is a tough time for me and my family
actually it's in 2 weeks but whatever lol
thats my friends emote
it was added because I beat him in mario party because of a hidden block
and I played birdo that round
I had like a 6 cost power rush in my seed but I already committed to danger mario
power plus is 6 cost and its only 1 attack
why is it always this skin
I like how storywise half of the guys bowser assigns to the star spirits are total wimps
i was not, i did a pretty big sleep today and don't regret it
theres no darkness effect on the color puzzle idiot
I worry about the bot sometimes. lol
I mean at least its not like a single white mother from illinois
lmao. that was hilarious.
I forgot the number but I bet that's why youngster Timmy is commiting hate crimes
sometimes I wish mayor penguin really died
I wish Goombario was here
I wish that detective died
prologue junior fight no way
when I did my seed I accidentally activated the chapter 3 junior fight
ooooh nice star point deal
I like how he just throws the mushroom across the room. lmao
I think I have a fever im getting really cold
they should make Goombario tell you checks for each area when you're in that room
goombario is very knowledgeable though
he can tell you enemy stats
incoming power rush trap
too many cars and people are dumb. (it's a wedding)
which sound fx badge is the one that makes that "OUGH" noise
thats my favorite one
which sound is c
is there something special or whatever if you equip all of them?
I don't remember what any of them are
ngl I forgot that wasn't the normal hammer sound
that's the one I was looking for
I thought the single white mother from illinois was quoted
it's in the Discord
did I do something wrong for it to not show up?
man I was seeing how long I could go without revealing my gender guess I gotta if I want to see the bot message
I'm mobile frog at work
what do you want from me?
im in the discord now
now everyone knows my dark secret of being a woman
I just want to be at home, chilling and watching Phantom stream "The Quest for Lakilester", right next to my 10 boxes of Baja Blast.
okay im back and see chat spamming quotes
i forgot about 14
wait? so you stream everyday?
"read the fine print Axl!"
dang run over already that was a quick bowser fight
I love how the koopa bros give an obscene amount of xp despite being regular koopas with 1 extra health
koopa bros have a different sleep chance which is interesting
weird to put that detail into a battle thats usually over in 5 seconds
casually it would take longer
casually I beat them with a pow block and fire flower
casually I knocked them down with the hammer
damn really I just did it because I wanted to hit all of them
im talking about my first playthru 20 years ago
my first playthrough was like 3 weeks ago
this was my first rpg not counting pokemon, and my 13 year old self didnt think like that
I havent gotten to playing ttyd blind yet because I just like this game so much
but ive played every other game besides ttyd
super and 64 are currently tied for my favorite paper mario
i do think ttyd is over rated tho
I loved the origami kings storyline. I enjoyed that game a lot, but paper mario 64 just hits different.
origami king is great
if only the bot agreed with you lol
I thoroughly enjoyed every paper mario ive played so far
i dont get the hate
PhantomGamesBot: Ok failbot didn't go yesterday so it was like final where he talks about the abomination that is Origami King? LuL
I hate the combat in origami king
and if I dont like the combat why would I play it
he had a cocnut
boy did he ever
for me to play OK Id need a guide for every fight, then whats the point? I should just watch a vod
I had no idea mega jump was so beefy
I never used it in vanilla
I had power bounce
I hope yoshis have an important item HYPERCLAP
That's the chaos we love, Mitzi
cocnut is like a BN abbreviation LUL
@know15 i gotchu anytime
i WOULD LOVE THAT
people dont understand the complex masterpiece that is the goomba king fight. The goomnut tree plays an essential role in the fight, being a source of damage for both you and the king. It also compliments the story of the prologue beautifully, because you previously beat up the red and blue goombas, their health is lowered for the fight. I think you should give more praise to the goomba king, because it really deserves it

that cloud is literally the worst
fuck copy pasta, sloppy pasta is where its at!!
hate him with a passion
making copypastas is great, I enjoy praising things people hate
fall guys need to make their battlepass level up thingy longer
100 levels is not enough
don't forget to feed the gourmet guy. (: best part of the game.
Back in my day there were only 40 levels in a fall guys season
amazing take Kris couldnt agree more
it was too repetitive when it first came out
there is so much more variety now its actually fun
It sure does have a lot of variety now
AXL are you hating on fall guys
no other game allows me to run around as pusheenicorn
whats the craziest vanilla thing youve gotten in a rando
a fight with Mitzi? BRING IT cats4eChat cats4eChat cats4eChat
but im weak now id prolly lose clintB
Axl is no simp
but i would still try. Id go for the knees
no arrows allowed ppls
I stopped going to the gym. to me it's a waste of time if my job is construction. I'm basically working out 12hrs a day 5-6days a week. lmao.
the voice of an angel
I wish I could have an n64 instrument voice like her
oh phantom, komari may join in a few bakuman epsiodes so was wanting to use your discord for watch party
I think it was either desert shop or yoshi shop
im waiting for this mob to spawn in WoW so i can have a chance at a mount that drops 1 out of 500 times HorseRide
this is what I do when I cant play pape clintB
I play fall guys and WoW
mitzi is too hard core of a gamer for me now
im sorry for your loss
dude in the last two weeks I think ive gotten 200 more hours in dbd im at like 1700 now i hate it
I'm a runescape player. lol. for like 17yrs. lmao.
I am not even hardcore. I dont like raiding or endgame stuff. I just wanna ride the cool mounts
I just watch others play games while increasing my backlog
you can get the jelly on your way back
my first rando the miracle water was here
and bow had the weight OMEGALUL
SHE WAS IN THE FLOOR
maam no you do not belong there
whenever I get a pronoun wrong I just say english is my 2nd language Kappa
whatever makes you happy bot. l0l
My mom messes up pronouns all the time and english is her second language so that tracks
my god this stupid mechanical spider wont spawn
ohhhhh. that's pretty nifty.
I just want to be disappointed again
the ultra stones twin!
what is synonymous with ultra
man Im waiting for the fateful day I receive the golden kappa
okay so we have the Ultra stone and it's twin... the Max rock
the hype emote is adoraable
mitzi, are you doing offline randos?
no I cant play pape at all
no space for my crt and stuff in my current situation clintB
why didn't you get exp? is it that bump attack thing?
it is sad thank you
we need to make a gofundme to fly Mitzi to my house so she can do pape permitBless
maybe in a week or two my situation will be a bit better
when I am able to im gonna be grinding glitchless so hard like I miss it so much clintB
No that's the thesaurus
That's just dirty, Mitzi
im gonna laugh REALLY hard if yoshis has the dirt
poor guy never stood a chance
you sneezed on him and he died
oh you know what would be worse than yoshis having the dirt?
yellow yoshi having the dirt
wow thanks for the noodles HERES SOME DIRT
the dirt is important though
its the only dirt in the entire world thats fertile apparently
"I have spaghetti in my pocket" now THAT'S out of context gold if I've ever heard it
Just a Peril manip
on to the next mob that MIGHT drop a mount
did you find goombario yet
power of the cocnut
Gotta find another one for bowser
final hit MUST be a cocnut
i mean if the opportunity is there
beat paper mario using only coconuts
make a mod where you have infinite cocnuts
REPLACE HAMMER THROW WITH "COCNOT" THROW
WAIT I have an idea
moles song is a banger though
notice how I never made a moles prediction, thats because I knew it didnt have a key item
he's got the dirt
whos he got the dirt on
hopefully not me I dont need my secrets being revealed
he's got the dirt on the soil
I don't want to know where he had that.
w00t. called it. lol
ok it just has to be listed now. there is a cocnut emote on 7tv now
you got wenough cocnuts?
not me trying to understand what the bot is saying
that's just ridiculous. lmao
"the first second of the crab" like what
I found a youtube channel with all the episodes for TMNT 2003
the crab has a high chance of changing accidentally in the first second and you save a ton of time if it doesnt change
meow i dont understand
when is go mode already?
not so shrimple anymore
you're not in go mode until you get Goombario shrimpsPetTheMoss
check the spoiler log
or yellow yoshi tho i wouldnt trade spaghetti for goombario
don't compare goombario to tax evaders
goombario goes to jail for tax evasion
that sounds like a good spin off game title
i just saw goombario, GO BACK!!
Goombario is innocent guy
wait Goombario is here?
tubba blubba probably smells like dead fish Kreygasm
did you do all sewer checks?
he is technically a walking corpse
tubba is a zombie
can tubba be the next antagonist for resident evil thank you
funny how a cocnut is more useful than goombario
cocnut is the most useful item in the game
Gentleman's agreement to let you go
So I dont get it. where do all the clubbas go during the chase
youd think theyd be there to help big boss man
Mario is a sociopath
they went to the basement
cannonically mario does a genocide run i see
but the grabby guys too
Mario resets his genocide run and does it again
you cant kill those. where did they go?
you're telling me ALL the grabby guys were having a party in the main room and happened to get crushed
ok fair makes sense Kappa
stuck struggling under the rubble
ok does anyone know what manatees are referred to as when comparing them to a land animal?
because my brain immediately went "water bear" not "water cow" but apparently its water cow
just a random thought LUL
are you playing another seed after this run by chance?
I know the point of the rando is to beat it... but after I get into go mode I lose motivation
im 0.8k away from being able to redeem
but I want to save up for Elite Smash
I just wanna find things
OH MY GOD HIS CALCULATOR
HOW DID IT GET IN SPACE
I still believe in the peach's castle goombario
Had to step away, where was dirt?
WAIT I MISSED GOURMET GUY, FUCK!
what preset do you use?
I'm looking over rando settings
rip Koopa Bros., never seen again
I think you got him
pretty lucky is really cool
i love how you do the quick math
my brain is like "he has taken damage. nice"
alright we pray for the dumpy
how do I send you the settings/seed?
yay! does that mean you're playing another one?
@buff00n you're the real MVP! (: Thank you.
TOAD IS SHOWING HIS RAC LIKE 10 BUCKS ON SATURDAY
Mitzi is getting really excited
who has 10 bucks
typical... someone on twitch asking for money Kappa
listen i just wanna see the toad rac
I MISSED IT NOOOO
Phantom. Chat. I apologize in advance.
I was clicking stuff that seemed interesting to me.
I swear I've been at 29.2k for 5 years
i wanna give you a seed
YOOO my boyfriend went to get us some baja blasts and he got them for free! Today is a great day!
I could do 2 seeds right now but saving for that sweet sweet vip
it's a damn shame I can't share or combine channel points with someone
admittedly, that'd be busted
Well I'm about to call a Majora's Mask Rando race so I'll have to catch this one in post. Good Luck
I would give axl my points so he could be vip
you can delete from ED!?
this filename is gross
get rid of it
@TacoGuyy better or worse than "Malort's"
The fuck you wanna gamble on
i hate this seed already bye bye
Before I go though, Title for this VOD: This isn't even my seed
cloud boi first partner? EZ MODE
I assume he just turned on random item start
I saw a usable Power Smash
I will make you windwaker literate this week so I don't have to talk during frame perfect shit
there is a setting that does stuff with glitches
Ouch, Bean on Rip Cheato 5
even when there is no cheating allowed !
He's not cheating he's playing as intended
The 3 fortress keys you don't need are just there for fun
do u have icon for trading event?
i mean something must be wrong with the rando since there are no cocnuts
Mitzi you should make a seed that has an inventory full of cocnuts at the start
I would also do that
That's a good reward
@know15 that would be so funny
I see you can beat chapter 1 as the devs intended
u got the best badge! deep focus
i want goombario to be on the stump behind koopers house
this is now a I spy a cocnut stream :)
ok time to lurk I need to watch this summoning salt video
I wonder if that's real
Go save him this instant
lakis long lost brother

"I disagree with your existence" my new go to insult LMAO

bomb got to haopy

so bomb went boom from happy and became ghost
She's mad you didn't talk to her first
ooh yeah like... how DARE you HEAL before talking
I want to hurt you while you are already hurted Kappa
bomb needs to find twin to take twin body
she has a cocnut
that star peice could be a panel star pieces so it could not be vanilla
@PerMitzi still worth it
@phantom5800 did u check if u need partners to use them
getting personal stuff done in golf/tennis
Peach: Mario HATES Fire Flowers. Loathes the things.
your bot plays golf/tennis
Holy fuck buff00n where did that come from
star pecies for cocnut
He fucking swang the horny in bears replies
Bear was speaking my language
I responded in kind

modCheck where he go
soul silver and Y have completed national dex

BLOOPER LET U PASS FOR 1 COCNUT
always name the female trainer Haleigh
BLOOPER TALK IN 3RD PERSON BC BLOOPER SEEMS LIKE IT
u can share ur sub if it resub anytime u want
@Axl_Sensei I usually name my characters Stinko but that's also a good name
u can share it on the last day of sub LUL
was it 11 months then
No you can do it twice a month if the anniv and the money desync
I had 2 on linkus' stream for a while lolll
so once eshop shuts down pokemon bank will be free, but once servers shut down we wont have a way to transfer anymore
It just doesn't allow a message on the money triggering one
im gonna fall while I watch gl gl
don't fall too hard
IT WILL COST 1 COCNUT TO PASS
its nice pokemon company isnt shutting down completely
I am close to having all the achievements in fallguys
Mitzi, which starter do i pick?
always the fire one
the only way you dont pick fire is if the other ones are RIDICULOUSLY cute
I always go water except for gen 8 where I pick nothing
i dont remember the english now LUL
what if the weight is there tho
bow has it Kappa
Its male so HellFire it is!!
There WAS a lemon early on
Buff00n wants you to suffer
do shovel jump coward
sounds like you're just bad
ive never seeen shovel jump
I've done it a few times
WHAT man I love seeing new stuff
ive never seen shovel jump, you should show it off 4Head
ssj. Swag Shovel Jump
i see SSJ my mind goes to dragon ball
did u get the cocnut
im expecting to see more cocnut in the future
@Phantom5800 You should try speedrunning Paper Mario Randomizer - cocnut%
wow double fright jar?
@PerMitzi You should try speedrunning Paper Mario Randomizer - cocnut%
Hey man, I just discovered you through Youtube and have already watched several of your rando runs. love the content!
@Phantom5800 You should try speedrunning Paper Mario Randomizer - cocnut%
After seeing your gains from rando I can't fucking wait for wwhd rando
the double fright jar in the shop!
@Phantom5800 make a channel point redeem for paper mario rando cocnut%
that what I was saying that to LUL
@Phantom5800 i like cocnut% do u phantom?
this is a good emote
thank you I try
i love your bot
i do too LUL
it agrees with everything I say
@Phantom5800 make a channel point reward for a cocnut% speedrun
make it a million kagillion points
cats, with 30K points you can make him do any seed
only seems fair Kappa
ive already redeemed it once
I already played my seed
and phantom hated it lmao
bro my random duo partner abandoned me.
I hope I win
me against the world
the volcano panel is so obnoxious
omg im cracked. I JUST GOT FIRST I BETTER QUALIFY
im a lily leaper legend
Yo they announced the next 2 avengers movies
They come out in... 2025
whats the point of announcing something so far off
unless its for shareholders
the last marvel movie I saw was IronMan 1
its just a cheepcheep
not a good fish to cook
I just have no interest in super hero movies
yoshi will eat it
my brother had me watch batman vs superman. Its was fine but it was sooooooooo fucking long!!!
just give me a 45 minute marvel movie and ill watch
@Phantom5800 can i cook the fish? or do u need it
if u get a fish
can i cook it so i can eat it
do u need the fish
did you ever give whats his face the mailbag?
did u gib vase
oh its the big boi blooper
did u beat chapter 2
did u beat game
is it safe to assume that all the panels you havent been able to check are irrelevant or are you going to have to backtrack?
this is a tough one LUL
misstar said no <3
@Phantom5800 wordle for u after seed https://mywordle.strivemath.com/?word=yctqfx
@Phantom5800 OMG IT BEST BADGE
IT WORTH LIKE 69 COCNUT
69 COCNUT - interesting currency there
quote 5 is a banger
oh that one is good too
LETS GOOO against all odds
HE JUST WANTS THE PAPER
either I get abandoned or my teammate is a literal child. fall guys duos is rough
"I was originally offered to be a train wreck"
OMG IT WAS A MOUSE WHO U GAVE U A RUSTY HAMMER THAT U HAD TO BUY TO SEE MOUSE
building is cocflaged in cocnuts
laki can go through walls :O we see this when the stairs flip :O LAKI IS HECKER
i forgot lakitus are koopas
how does a laki get a cloud
they were born with cloud?
u got lime candy for anti guy
we all like lime candy
anti guy no like leamon
anti guy like lime
but anti guy takes lemon to destroy it
thought u knew that
i can just see that the card shows a dried shroom and not a spirit
CAN I COOK IT
I WANT TO EAT IT
why no taste good?
it just a fish
a yoshi would eat it :)
ok im back from harassing's my pets
can i eat the dirt
it was a bomb... not a calculator u did not see that?
xfinity billed me for an extra month of internet after I cancelled my services >:(
told me it would be 2 months till I get my money back
why does mario not look at things before mario pick up things... mario could avoid so many bombs in chest
oh damn i forgot to call them today to bitch about it
I just wanna know the status of my refund
the thing is I was on autopay right? but when I called to cancel my account they made it so I couldnt access any billing stuff so I couldnt turn off auto pay after I called
so they just took my money
like how is that not illegal
And I used to work kinda in that field so when I went to complain the guy showed me his screen and I was BRUH I CAN READ THIS
I was finna fight
I once had it where Comcast owed me like $80 and I owed them $80 but they refused to just be like "yep adds to 0"
So I literally paid them and they mailed me a check
my lil 5'3 self in the xfinity store with my pink hair and flip flops
I woke up in a rage
kooper gets to be naked this seed yay!
bombette just sucks yeah clintB
her hitbox be garbo too >:(
Pick up an item while you're pushing a block
Pick up an item while you're pushing a block
thank god im not high because i would be losing my mind over these bot messages
I mean I do have some edibles left
@TacoGuyy when's weed luigi
@buff00n You don't pay attention to twitter do you
That was literally something I posted immediately with weed mario shit lmao
boo's portrait at boo store Kappa
omg theres another pusheenicorn
there can only be one
@TacoGuyy I was talking about an emote for weed luigi
it's in the name dumbass
potato and ice doll?
Ice potato and fire flower sounds like the lamest super hero movie
how did that baby seed end up earlier
those fp and bp values Kreygasm
GL on the rando whaccaStarkid
did you ever check antiguy Kappa
did you do prologue?
Watch that motherfucker have something good
OH SHOOT MOMS SPAGHETTI
someone lost their soda in the jungle sad day
Pollution in the rainforest moment
we havent seen one of these in a hot minute
early cocnut seed clintB
bow has the weight Kappa
worse than the island one?
throw out all the spear guys imo
Is there any way the rando will softlock you from progressing? Like key items in the last level
junior troopa softlock ive seen
egg boi bad boi
no wonder he was sitting on that panel
what about the volcano panels? clintT
understandable but I will remind you of them when you need em Kappa
Are all glitches allowed in rando?
not in the community races
Dude i just started a seed, no kidding watt, bow, and laki all in a row in Pleasant Plains
and sushie was being sold by merlow
too bad you dont need that key
is normal logic off?
how about the jade raven?
yeah, you're gonna ride on sushie as she swims. 100% intended.
the land is water obvi
"the live bot" oh no
Yeah this is in the manual
youve been live for almost 6 hours, dont forget to hydrate and stretch
your bot has been poppin off
hey you can use refresh now!
Have you done Dolly check? It isn't checked off on the tracker so I'm not sure
goombario gave you a coin
imagine if dolly is a coin too
It's a good YouTube title
guy posted a pic from a game shop. English Gregar was 100 bucks
Or something like that
GBA is region free too
oh? I thought you used GBI
umm can you delete that
do you use GBA for controller?
oh wii pro classic
This is a nice coloring for him tho
that gold crown lookin fresh
i did not know that was an emote
sore arm? stay away from hub KEKW
didnt check off the weight meow
whats the worst thing that happened this seed
this seed looks delightful just from the look of the tracker
M4 doing all cards, I walk in on fuzzy fight. "Good to see chapter 1 is scaled to chapter 1 4Head "
do you use balanced random for fp and bp or full
final boss goomba king
ive been trying out different settings every rando so far idk what to settle on
ye balanced seems kinda stale for what im looking for
thatll be next then ty
people dont understand the complex masterpiece that is the goomba king fight. The goomnut tree provides a source of damage for both you and the king. It also compliments the prologue's story perfectly, since you fought the red and blue goombas already, their hp is reduced for the fight. I want you to praise the goomba king more, he deserves it.
bow looks like a normal colored boo
is that outta sight 7 fp
why have you done this to yourself
how does he eat a lollipop so fast
especially one of that caliber
mario must have really strong teeth
remember to brush and floss if you want teeth like mario
small grammar error :(
stanley please save yourself
did you do yoshis yet
this is why I dont turn panels on (yet)
3 hours in not even go mode
what even is left
I had a feeling about that I was gonna ask
youve checked every shop?
did you do panels in shooting star summit?
did you do ground pounds in merlons house
did you do the extra forever forest checks
panels in koopa village?
did you do everything you can in mt rugged
it's gonna be something real dumb
mt rugged strikes again
parakarry having seed or train would be better
i feel like he did give letters tho
but vanilla parakarry is funny
you dont understand though
i hate the ufos
how stinky are the stinky herbs
gives you fortress keys and then you go to fortress and it gives you tubba keys
too much work I agree
I post my stream vods when i stream once in a blue moon
dont feel like editing stuff
I definitely can I just dont want to
just exit out of the game and put it in the recycling bin on stream
thats what im saying
in ancient china criminals were punished by the ancient water torture method. But the worst criminals of all were forced to play this seed
should have ended on the bowser fight in chapter 1
that would be really funny
I switched to my phone so I'm gonna have like 30 sec delay
Get go mode without moles and then do moles and then end the seed
See I said to do go mode without moles because I knew it didn't have a key
go fast for buffoon's standards
did u find cocnut?
vod will have "with a side of cocnut" in title
At least the hammerless seed was unique
Buy followers, primes and viewers on mystrm .store
if the bot let me buy cocnuts I would do it
I wanna make a seed where snowman's gift has like 6 toy trains or something and they're all traps
go in rigby chat and redeem chapter 3 sucks @phantom5800
I like chapter 3 in the base game
Not good for randos though
be funny if have coxnut
is "coxnut" the plural of "cocnut"? teambnThink
Cocnuts is just a description of what they do, not the plural
well sorry your seed was crap, but im glad i made it for a stream! im moving in a week and have loved being able to watch your randos while i pack.
The WORST seed ever
the seed would not let me put it in the ground while other bad seeds let me put it in ground but it grows
but it does not *
10 is the record thus far
Wonder what's keeping JCog away for this long
He was streaming a seed on Goombotio today
Ah, I see, bummer
Ope Maddi is live
God that was miserable
geez, that ch1 start paying off big
Wth is going on
I love early raids for streams
I hope you have a nice stream
Phantom I just realize I didn't followed you this entire time LOL
Ope power just went out
you have to use mystery? now
Just the typical 5pm thunderstorm that made its way from the mountains.
I have no idea how Quizmo spawning works in vanilla lol
It's like almost everyday in the summer here
Omg windows forced an update too.
Yeah south East. Thankfully not florida
I just saw that you'd run Shadows of Almia and saw the notes LMAO
I'm not going to do that tho 8 hr run is a nightmare
go to ch. 3 to test?
Well that opened a good big
man I need to save 10,000 points for 4 great games and one random Hamtaro game
I can earn points if I tier 3 and do shit that gets me bonus points
yeah each is 200K
They're practically telling you to use it
Mega Quake pretty funny
Portrait just unlocks so much
I'd say do 13-16
realized you were racing while I was out grabbing tacos
Eh, I've had weight in gultch
twitchRaid twitchRaid Someone call for a Doctor? MD is in house!! twitchRaid twitchRaid GL
Very good, thank you. Got some help learning some complex trickery for Metroid Prime 2 rando
Stacked Guy's Toybox I see
I recognize those echoes. You found Power Rush PogChamp
hey how's the run going?
have we used the mystery? yet?
wait we have cake to feed the lad n' chad!
goombario is the hero we need
You were saying? KEKW
First time being able to watch a stream live POGGERS
Don't know why I got recommended ur rando vids on YT and haven't been able to stop watching them lol
same with me koop_troop
Helll yeah goombario. Just this seed tho.
Awwww yeah, Danger Mario
is it possible to softlock yourself by buying the wrong stuff at merlow?
hello my name is Victor I have ADDHHD OCD AUTISM DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND SEPARATION ANXIETY
for N64 I got Mario kart 64 super Mario 64 Mario party 123 Paper Mario Zelda oot Majors mask Dk64 Banjo kazooie and banjo Tooie smash bros Pokemon stadium 1 2 Diddy Kong racing Mario tennis Mario golf
Could also slowly farm quizmo
omg your the chapter I hate this chapter
I meant @jasonv12 do you can't really get softlocked by buying the wrong thing
Don't you have to do blooper to drive to dark koopas right now?
Ah nvm damn delay
have you touched chapter 2 yet?
I've been watching you on youtube, first time ive been able to watch live
Its only the one well check that could be behind it in logic? not the blue gate?
Where's my flying turtle, dammit
The other day I did a seed where the weight was in the basement of boos mansion...
Oh yeah LUL Well point still stands
That chomp is a chonk
I'm convinced its faster to just go along pleasant path rather than go to koopa village if youre going to koopa bros fortress from toad town
its only two screens vs like 4 or 5
sorry, dont mean to backseat
what emulator do you use? or are you on an everdrive
I'm debating getting a GBA everdrive
what are star rod mods
Does Black Pit still get updates?
koopa koot ~ trouble
they made berries a key item, why not the cake?
ahh, yes that is complicated
is the trick allowed even if you dont have the water stone?
cuz that could skip some logic potentially
do you have a list of all the long checks you skip until theyre your last resort?
where are the leaderboards for the community race?
They should randomize the ruins puzzle solution
And the toy box color order
so you actually have to use the mystery note
No I mean, they should randomize the order for each seed
and same with the ruins puzzle
did you check rowf after beating chapter 6?
Is it possible for a seed to not need ultra boots at all?
is it possible to not even get any upgrades???
being in go mode for ch 7 sames soo much time
still no muliverse... sign lol haha it's free for everyone now.. go get it lol
the "what" is in response to GamesBot
so you were running around looking for the "third" key when you actually already had 3?
oh yeah so that was your fourth?
Did we miss one in Chapter 6?
how close are these races typically?
wow that seems really close for how random it is
do you find out when they finish?
yeah wasnt sure if i was allowed to say
this fight is actually a waste of time lmao
Are you gonna make the youtube title related to the key mix up?
i just noticed no ultra boots monkaS
thankfully hammer sucks, i wasn't looking at that one tbh LUL
in a rando setting, you'd never need ultra hammer which is pretty cool
depending on the seed
Huh it never occurred to me there's no blocks in the way of just finishing chapter 2
just the three chomp room checks
imagine bowser ever doing fire
and the artifact check
>most likely attack btw
oh wow he did it
ask and receive, apparently
i just always assume my run dies after peach beam lmao
what a weird pattern
That was a fight
guess that was to make up for that 1st fight where Bowser dicked you around a bit
thanks for the fun stream
GG, and good night psykitPsycho7
SSBB Subspace, Luigi Mario's Mansion, kami, Super Paper Mario, and Hampter
Yeah, mobile delay is something else
oh you have koopers shell too
we're gonna need more than 5 for that one lol
Celebrate by getting speedied
I am here, to "bless" the run
I like a pape
Why did twitch tell me that they're a returning chatter lol
You have to turn it off as a mod
I mean I'll keep it on
I didn't know it was a thing LUL
getting the pre-johns out of the way early Kappa
I just tried to get a dazzle from 2014 to work on windows 10 for pape. Now 7 hours of hell. What CC do you recommend
@Jhawk___ You ever get it working?
there's a pretty cheap jpn capture card you can get that runs retro games fairly well
el gato for older games can be weird on loading
I didn't. I completely lost the video now, and the audio keeps getting worse @dj_phatzo I fucked with the drivers too much and now I have a USB recognition error
ye gv usb is the cheapest option that actually works from what i hear
can we talk about how garbo that seed was
@jokehow I'll probably go with that. I'll be up and running on like thursday
I own a GV-USB 2, Dazzle, an off-brand Easy Cap, and an Avermedia, If you go retro, I would strongly recommend a GV-USB 2. If you plan to upscale get a retro tink and an Avermedia.
@Jhawk___ Feel that, I got mine up and running but only after a lot of trial and error :/
so the first thing I do is do the pond check in toad town... then I forget its a seed for FF so it took 4 hours to find parakerry. Didnt get ruins hammer until the THIRD visit FML
all I needed was miracle water to finish but quit before shiver mountain cause my left eye looked like a roadmap
@dj_phatzo I can't even do a system restore to undo what I did. It's greyed out. And no system restore folder in the registry either
It was so red
Hes here in spirit
I hope he's vanilla
once we get to fuzzy fight we'll know what chapter 1 is scaled too KEKW
nah cheddar chex mix the goat
what about sometimes vanilla checks? 50% any given key item or partner is vanilla
Gl have a good run on off to hike phanto274Lurk
I'm working on making the goomba king stuff shorter. will still be painful, but maybe less
hold up why's it spelled like that lol
@icebound777 don't worry about it
they have a cool theme
is there any partner that never gets a move in?
Does Laki attack in spook routes?
yeah, sushie uses squirt and we cant have that in phantom's christian minecraft server
I shells spotted a chomp
then did rando and had to dnf because my brother is visiting soon and the seed was a long one
I was 3 hours in with 2 star spirits saved
Yeah that seed was wild
the first chapter done was ch 7
like it was an insane seed
My 2 year windwaker anniv is in the end of august apparently
I ain't playing on a fucking tv
You know how many tricks I would just blatantly not be able to do if you changed my delay
Now i'm curious, How many people from Speedromizer are gonna be at MWSF
I'm going for the con and to shittalk phantom during his rando
Thats gonna be one i'm gonna tune in for
I live an hour from the venue lol
I'm glad you guys got a saturday/sunday runs cause we can go to the local on friday
Shouldn't be a bad uber
Black ice also started requiring masks too so it's a nicer time
I'm excited for my first prime time run xD
Also Jibca has people to stay with in the cities so I don't have to worry about him
And I don't think? Jaemi plans on going but unsure
Depends how he feels after SC
He was on a break from competing but he's going to AS with me this week
It's gonna be a funass time
Funny enough, Helix and I have been trying to get Undertale in for a while now. Last time I ran at fest was also with a game I was trying to get in for a while.
Laki seeds go crazy
might have to adjust the settings string, it's gonna change soon
I would've liked to get in but since it's 2dcon I have other shit to focus on so I'm just glad the homies get to come
that should be fine, depending on how the backend changes
uh, this be under wraps tho ..
pronyo says maybe tomorrow
I'm very impressed how fast you can read Japanese
I like how that's a joke with this game but TTYD genuinely has sway recognizing kanji that fast LUL
Yea they have good resources
TTYD is a ton of effort but it's really cool
ttyd glitchless is pain to learn
I still want to eventually do it but I just have a hard time getting motivated for what I know i have to do
how did mario in this game get anything done even when bowser didnt have the star rod
i wanna do a walkthrough kinda before trying a full run but i burnt out after ch4
he just barely beat junior
All crystal stars doesn't do chap 3 :)
You just shelf jump
were you running on jpn?
pokemon runners hate this guy he never runs in english
stickshamO shrimpsDrip stickshamRiku1a stickshamRiku1b shrimpsDrip stickshamO
i think im just gonna run english since i already have a disc
For glitchless english is just text timeloss
@Ohrocks too much drip
You were too cool for the chat
i think chapter completes heal you right
it's not me, I can't control that
I think any% is still faster on en tho
oh I finally have a fitting emote
this guys menuing is INSANE
21xx is impossible i dont get it
Rune factory 4 is ten years old
every time i feel like its a good prologue its 2202
I NEED THE 2P
IT WAS RIGHT THERE!!!
2P Bomberman is the funniest shit to run
this is 3:59 pace Kappa
You need a beer to go with it all?
Why would Mario need more than 4 caps? He already has enough and one is all he needs. tacogu1Yes
the rando muscle memory LUL
place your Un-Rando Randy bets!
getting 1 is actually pretty good
skill based fuzzy rng
Phantom should I bring the PS4 to MWSF for xrd and shit
I can also just bring a monitor
My 2nd one is way easier to bring around
Just figured may as well if you're bringing a stick to play other shit at the con
welcome back to glitchless plupBully
It looks like it's just me and jibca so we have room out the ass lol
im almost surprised it wasnt double dink
I'm gonna kill him
i mean, he's not that much worse than the average twitch chatter
is there a guide somewhere on setting up a uhhh "intelligent" bot
Almost as good as buttsbot
a good showcase run :tf:
sub 350 looks rough
One thing I super miss in strive after going to locals is vs themes
Honestly just instrumental music in general
Cause if you don't have shit unlocked on the setups you only have char themes
my next step is making my movement less homebrew
i lose so much time in open world
But yea I'm throwing together a playlist for music to use on stream and going through the xrd shit rn so that's why I thought of that lol
Also man I miss DI I need that ride the fire dopamine
Like you gave Ky a theme for his hair falling down in Xrd at least give him something for his DI in this game
what the frame window on cannon jumps?
I've hit the first one a singular time
And after that I just did the laki thing for rando
now THIS is a run
Its like you never left
must be coin blocks somewhere
you got the 5 loose ones and everything in fortress
RTA practice with full splits ez pz
it was the 2 coin blocks in first goomba room
might as well get reacquainted with the pain
you got them the first run
ye im still full baby route
ill probably mess with new strats after i grind any% a bit
glitchless is so cozy
i basically need to get early laki and bowser fight down and i can start
ye im just bombing for now
im grinding lzs stuff every day waiting for muscle memory to hit
i wanna eventually do hundo but i dont want to face tank every cutscene
i have a goal for glundo right now lol
ive read through the route a couple times but havent done a practice walkthrough yet
yeah its rough lmao
i hit 37 quizmos and stopped for the week
its so useful for ch3 tho
is the bot attempting to rhyme
Lots of vanilla items this seed
shshshshsh let the luck run it's course Kappa
ok yeah that parakarry is kinda oof BUT LISTEN
dink into basically a quad reroll this HAS to be the run
make sure you shellshot the chomp Kappa
my current pb has me being speedied cats4eSad
F O U R ?
you have to be joking
time to throw out the cart
get this cart exorcised
i warned you the dangers of pape and you still played
yo get no sympathy from me
if you get 3:49 might as well top10
cats4eWiggle because then I can watch the grind
mizti I wish you were around for my 3:49 grind
my irst 3:49 was a 3:49:59
I never shit myself so hard oing epilogue
Rigby235: I never shit
i found of video of phantom coding
dude i was drinking
Now youre cleaning up a mess
i'm not even sure i wanna finish derusting lmfao
but if i do play sometimes i will do some glitchless at some point
it would be cool if i finally pbed
no rng fuzzy, wow what a lucky run you got going on
illdo a proper gless soon
i dont wanna end it on shell shotting the chomp
me blocking any attack LUL
maybe when my current work assignment is over i could crank out some glitchless
i don't have time to grind anything longer than mgr rn
I want a better time as well, ideally id like to bop sway but that is so far off and there are other things I might want to do
i'm getting paid very very well for what i'm doing
it's a lot of work though
it's also interesting to work for the elections board
oh yeah i got that,
i almost did it but let it sit too long
it's a really good deal
up to you of couse
but hello fresh is good and fair
it's the best sponsorship offer i've ever gotten
and it is the only one i considered taking
Ive been a fan of them
i accidentally declined free food from hello fresh Sadge
i would do it if i were you
I have never installed raid for someone but I would do it for you
I would do it if i got the offer
Also I hate fresh with this discussion I need to remove this emote
hello fresh is anti union so fuck that
that's a mega fucking yikes
May be why its a good deal
i got another offer from them
for even more money than the last one
I mean I care. But people can take whatever sponsors they want
they were offering me $100 per subsciption before but now it's $125
they're desperate for the 10 people who watch me stream mgr to see their brand
they are the raid shadow legends of food LUL
im one of the 10
sponsor wise that is
PerMitzi: they are the raid shadow legends of food LUL
I am also one of those 10
mx_four: PerMitzi: they are the raid shadow legends of food
Rigby235: mx_four: PerMitzi: they are the raid shadow legends of food
That's what monado said when I told him to add the emote
i don't like union busting but since i got fired immediately after spending 2 grand on gdq i feel like i should consider it
i prob won't do it
I just don't cook and don't have spare cash rn
i'm so deep in the hole after getting fucked by my last company
I still have to pay you for 2dcon lol
they haven't paid me for my last week either
I recently applied for a job since ive been jobless for a while. pre hire interview in like two days
i hope you get it!
Ryan if you say it
You applied to the one but I don't remember anything else
i almost never do that dw
it's gotta be really funny for me to do that
I would unban m4 even if I didn't have power
You can't unban Ryan if they're not even banned in the first place
I would never ban Ryan
I'm only gonna be working 20 hrs a week if I get it. I am so burnt out from when I had two jobs earlier this year. 60 hrs a week got me dead
Ryan come learn CT with me
I need to practice WW but I also don't want to get up to plug in my shit
how long is the run?
I can pick up extra hours if I want too so I think it will be a decent fit. 5 hours a day 4 days a week
that's really long for how much im working rn
if it's on snes classic
@PerMitzi that's pretty much what I currently work
i will look at it on the weekend
@TacoGuyy Much more reasonably and sustainable right?
Yea it's a pretty chill schedule
you almost caught me drinking again
That is the best thing the bot has said all day
the lovely peril beeps
Phantom is like a Rhyhorn caught in Pokemon Emerald... Once it starts running, it doesn't stop. Its tiny brain makes it so stupid that it can't remember why it started running in the first place.
My favorite track in the game
oh wait I looked at the wrong message in my discord, my 2 year anniv for windwaker was on the 15th woops I missed it lol
EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE
EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE
mx_four: EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE
TacoGuyy: mx_four: EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE EEE
I will never financially recover from your reset splits sound
Jesus christ it makes me laugh everytime
after speedrunning this game, that track just isn't the same without the peril noises over it
i'll teach you any%
I'll teach you windwaker
I wanna come back to this game, but I have like 239847928374923 things I gotta do first
log skip is free
im a log skip genius
no don't skip the pogs
I will skip all the pogs
there will be NO hype
All my homies hate jesse
i need to know if i hate them or not
mvdW < this bitch
I'll say mvd if I'm typing cause it's fast but I will always call him jesse
dude i just think of aaron paul
Also my uber to the airport at double down was called by jesse and the driver called him jestisee
No I will not say that name
If I was slightly more mexican I could get away with it
it's not racist if you're paying them :)
Bot literally said "Why did you send money to that *****"
And the paypal bot did exactly that
I should add them but I always forget lol
Is that why you were short last run
i left for 2 minutes
speaking of looking through the vod, did you find out where that one ruins key came from
mistakes were made... mistakes were always made...
Sausage, Beef and Bacon
for these rando races do i just need to pop in the pape discord
i could use some sausage, beef, and bacon rn if you know what i mean
Can you please explain
time to boot up my favorite wii u app, haxchi
ye ive got racetime
or sorry @nintendo it is brain age :)
a wee bit of racing
Technically not lying :)
I'll race someone in sm64, I just need a 15 minute headstart
I'll race someone in windwaker rando
i need one because i'm bad
I haven't played ww rando in a year but I can still do storage and shit
this 2 months of pape destroyed my sm64 consistency who would have thought :tf:
i decided it was easier to get sub hour in an entirely new game rather than shave 30 more seconds off my mario time
I do not currently play a game that could sub hour so I can't do that Sadge
Look the last time I played SM64 was when I played rando and got yeeted off the stage by the Chuckya
mario's fun though fr but i gotta be in the mood
Right when I spawned
Well technically I could but I don't wanna mss lol
yo luigi's mansion's a dope speedrun
tbh i'd speedrun all of them if i had the hardware
i have a 16.16 in 16 star and pape saved me from grinding myself into oblivion for those frames
I should play a single mgs game
I havent been able to play pape for a whole month cats4eDead
Rising looks hype but after my hitman kick came back I wanna play stealth shit
you stealth in rising
(in like 4 rooms)
There's a stealth segment in windwaker... but you can just roll past it
it is literally just faster to kill everything in most stealth sections though
raiden is too jacked
my sister's fave is 2
i love all of the metal gear games so much
Doesn't mgs4 have the movie ass cutscene
if i made a top 10 favorite games list it'd be lame as fuck because 6 of them would be mgs games
mgs4's final cutscene is deadass like 90 minutes long
My top 10 games has 2 rune factory games
some of it it broken out though
but all together it's like 90
I found it really hard to skip astral chain cutscenes
more like asstral chain
more like mistral chain
i'm an smrpg stan
emerald is a great choice
id agree with that
b/w 2 for me
what do you think of platinum?
"too much water" Kappa
but platinum had my boy Pochama
i think sinnoh sucks and platinum was better but not better enough to save it
was sun and moon really forgettable for you guys
gen 4 was meh at best for me
i played through ultra moon and dont remember anything from it
i enjoyed gen 7 when i played through it but it's so much of a fucking slog that i could never replay it
Johto best region don't @ me
that was a pop and drop type of gen
imagine pape prologue but it's the whole game
and also final bowser isn't the end
and that's gen 7 to me
mario is anti social today LUL
My list off the top of my head would be like Windwaker > RF5 > RF3 (interchangeable order for those 2) > Ori 2 > TTYD > Smash Ult > Hollow Knight > Pokemon Black/White > Kirby's Amazing Mirror > and honestly probably maplestory LOL
what an absolutely wild list
Maplestory has lasted me 10+ years I don't think I can not put it on there LUL
i played maplestory back in the day
dude that shit is gonna be 20 next year
I played maplestory cuz a cute girl did lol
that game shares my birthday lol
i really liked marksman
@AudioBlood does she still play
I haven't talked to her in like... 12 years
I need someone to power quest with to max out my aran
but probably, she seems the type
maplestory 2 would've been in my top 10 but they shut it downb
I'm sad they shut down 2 so fast
you played it ice???
bro we met a few years too late
i loved it so much
I played a good amount of ms2 with my sister
i played priest and a soulbinder
Soulbinder was what I played
lemme find my screencaps
<- chronic support bitch
NO MY FREE VIP!!!!!
The other MMO I time dumped the SHIT out of was Elsword
i STILL play Flyff
I still do off and on but not to the extent of maple
I was a stereotypical wow nerd
i dont have screencaps sadly bc
I just got my aran to 200 on maple last week lol
it was something my ex and i did and they were always there
but i have like
visual memory of my ingame house
there is nothing i like more than an MMO with a group of people I like
but that's jsut so so so so so rare
when's the maplestory group
audio do you play classic
bc i play with tiff sometimes
they just revamped explorers again like a month ago
I do not play classic. I was considering grabbing it for wotlk tho, that was my best memories
im gonna play wotlk a lot probably
that expansion exactly i've seen on so many 'favorite game of all time' lists
Also m4 we still gotta play phas sometime
yeah, it's definitely my best memory in gaming
totc, icc, ulduar. how tf does that get beat
Anything I know about warcraft characters is from HotS
im down for phas at some point
after the new update drops
i have too many hours in it and it struggles to hold my attention when there isn't new stuff nowadays
I haven't played since before the last major update past testing my vr
I would kill to go back to the days of college just gayming with the lads in perpetuity. what a time
phas is too solvable and relies a lot on the unknown
so when you start knowing it it gets way less interesting
that's wehat kill amogus
I think that's why I'm excited to play it because I have no idea about the new patches and I'd be in vr
I miss among us nights but I don't miss among us
among us just got too solved basically. everyone got too good, impostors were boned
among us was fun for me for a little while but people yelled a lot in like every group i played
I miss jesse screaming at people for being dumb lol
fortnite amongus is the new wave
i played a bunch with popesquidward and his group. it got too yell-y for cOnTeNt
I think it helped for ours to last so long because we never streamed the shit
Jesse did sometimes but not usually
Brett was never there lol
I wish he was
Brett came if me and knives bugged him enough
The florida fuckers were great
DUDE KENDALL IS SO FUCKING FUNNY
Playing with cley was also an experience
That was when I started talking to jesse more in general lol
Cause I always feel like I'm just bothering someone when I start a convo until they start inviting me to do shit and I've never been able to break that mindset
i simply never talk to anyone that doesn't talk to me first unless it's in a public forum
like twitch chat :)
same, i never initiate with people. it's why my friend group is so small lol
Loaf is also literally just me besides him not speedrunning lol
Same name, similar hair, same character lmao
i always forget twitch is so young
my friend circle isn't small but
i have very few close friends
and even them i don't talk to all that much
The one thing I thank smash locals for is meeting jaemi/jibca
my relationships are all the kind where if we dont talk to each other for a whole ass month nothing changes
Because without them I have fucking 0 friends nearby LOL
I haven't talked to anyone from high school since about a year after high school. Which was about 15 years ago
My longterm friends I've stuck by are other tacoguy and his siblings and his cousin lol
This year is 15 since my senior year, graduated in 08
Nobody else has stuck around
@mx_four yeah same. the friends i have are the kind that just kind of endure
I do still talk to a few people from college though
A lot of my conversational friends are via twitch at this point though
What a coincidence, my partner and I talk ABOUT my ex a lot. But that's cause my ex is text book human trash :)
I make 300k a year if you count like 5 years as one year
But yea the friend I've had the longest is my favorite, we don't talk a terrible amount but he still puts up with my bullshit the same LOL
https://twitter.com/TacoGuyy/status/1490218234750148608?s=20&t=x_xd3JpsCwlGMXBGzO4uMw he's my favorite
Oh oh, do they drop the line "i had a hard life growing up"
im going to throw up
i had a real rich friend in hs whose parent's died and left him their money and boy do we just not understand each others lives
like im not broke, i make ok money and my wife does too, we got some money in the bank (tho we lack assets a lil bit atm) but it's a whole other level for a lot of people
i'll take it if you don't want it
better than retail job phanto274Smile
House prices piss me off right now cause I can't buy one BECAUSE of the prices
my wife and i could buy one right now, but the itnerest rates are so fucked atm
i bought my house end of march right before the rates got fricked
it's awful cuz we *really* want a house before we have a kid so our whole lives are kind of on pause
id be paying like 1.5x + if i waited a month
yeah, mortgage payments here are about $500 more a month than they were when we started looking
1.9% on a 400k house? bro if you move you're cracked
Yeah I was talking to someone who bought a house near Seattle for like 550, and theirs is now worth 4+
California isnt any better fifiDed
All affordable housing was bought out by airbnb folks
C A P I T A L I S M
before i bought my house i was paying $700 a month rent for a 3 bed with a yard plupMS
just move to bumfuck nowhere Kappa
I used to work as an apt manager and we once found out someone was renting their apt out as an airbnb LUL
Want a cheap house? Come move to the North shore in Louisiana. You can buy a 4br house for like 275
like every other beach front property across the states is air bnb'd now its crazy
sorry ice but the only reason id ever go to louisiana would be to hang out with you LOL
This place is bootycheeks
I wouldn't even come here to hang out with me tbh
This place is fucked
louisiana is great if you dont live there
well i wouldn't come to kansas to hang out with me so i mean
It's not even that joke LOL
i eat so much when i go down there
I'd probably order uber eats then leave the state
The food is the only redeeming factor
im too stuffed to care about 99% humidity
the location of the sin is very important
It's 85 outside, but with the 92% humidity
i'm glad we have PhantomGamesBot on top of it
It feels like 104
"Yo Ice, why don't you go outside?
instant sweat when you step outside
If I wanted swamp ass instantly, I'd open my front door
its been over 100 almost every day for like 2 weeks
except today bc it rained
i'm ready to die
my ac is blasting though so its ok. as long as I dont go outside
take me o great rng gods up high
Ryan just... don't go outside :)
it is literally too hot for my window ac + home ac combined
Baby Alive on those days. - closed captioning
pretty good just did 3 hours of Luigi's Mansion 1
Ok I finally plugged in my shit I'm testing a couple things then I'm actually gonna do runs and shit for the weekend lol
I will likely do multiple unless I low 2:20 lol
But yea I can stall a bit and just practice more shit
I can self comm a lot of it but there's a few things that I def don't wanna worry about talking during
Depending when she does it
2 is the average
3 is like the max if it's a frame perfect wave
Joaish has one for the AAAAAA
Ok glad I didn't start my mom just said she'll buy me food so I will be back lol
Also did you know the tree wall you need the sword for has an invisible wall
Even if you hack in the sword you have to go to orca before it goes away
If you have an item to slide with you can get around it
Hundo actually has to lol
is it faster to drop there than parrakarry over?
nice ill get some free timesave now i guess
Don't get the hp/fp up badges
all the homies hate fuzzies
Well that could be cool
Don't forget to rebadge
Making up for lost time
if you die to lantern ghost you die in real life
no peach cutscenes really makes the game so much smoother
i've died irl twice now
look i've had 2, 4 cap lantern ghosts in my career of gless
i've only done 35 attempts!
got my sub 4 and ran away
i'll eventually come back
that's why you learn it with me
okay okay... let's not get too hasty....
Nope he said he'd do it. Tomorrow it is.
can we run the lottery machine one time please :)
what if you win big tho
i can't learn q64 right now, too busy learning CT
CT is a ton of fun so far
god i lose a ton of time late game lol
i'm looking at my splits right now, and my gourmet time was 1:36:25
then my run falls apart LOL
no my split time is for acquiring the cake
i lied to your face
so my run loses like 3 minutes in bowsers castle lol
my chapter 7 time is 3:15:20 lmao
Oh cool I see you brought out the better timer
Ok I'm going to screencap just the top line of that because that's REALLY good
I sent you the screencap lol
I love the typo'd chuckle
But do you really feel like it
I autofilled the wrong cake emote but I stand by it
wait what happened i was afk
nothing happened the timer is normal
I wish it was that easy to boot codes on wii u
I have to hard turn off the console and then boot multiple things in haxchi
So it takes like 10 minutes to switch lol
are glitchless saves online somewhere i didnt see them when i was looking
i pretty much only need through ch6 anyways
There's no nasb at ssc lol
S O A P
Game is absurdly fucking dead
C A K E
i was gonna make my own too but i never want to sit down and do it
@Iceblue a fellow man of culture I see
ADD THE SOAP YOU COWARD
That cake is WRONG
He has NO taste
I wouldve eaten the cake
how dare you ban him
gourmet guy is BEST GUY
the new fp version looks awesome
confident in final bowser monkaS
that's implying i'm confident on final bowser
i learned the lightning block after he lightning'd twice in a row to kill my god run
biwser just throwing out casual 1% odds
i dont understand this lure
i let him dance for my own mental safety
fright jar strats BatChest
you can block lightning now? GOOD
which fight do you use it on
added to my brain for the next bad run
Double dink was my nickname in highschool
be proud of me phantom I get the thunder rage in the desert and this fright jar :3
no i dont do that
I have to retract the peepoClap now
bombette hitbox is pooey
when I get back to running ill try it OKAY so be ready to be proud of me LUL
yeah i dont believe you
Sounds like fake facts
sub 25 raph holy pace
I like the volcano so much
I like all the lil glitches you can do here in any%
like UHE and epic skip
I can do UHE
That's my favorite glitch
It's easier on the console than it was on emu
at least for me
k wait there is an early and there is a skip
i can do both
You should do a glitchless run someday and just have the tracker up and mark shit off
Run a tracker for gless
Keep up a bit too and be like "Weird for the update to add in prologue"
Streamer I don't know where you are in the run
My favorite badge, Spicy Soup
I will stop you
im really hoping itll be out before i have to run glundo
YOU HAVE 2 HP
phantom skip this please
please go in the wall
I can't believe you don't have Laki already
if you missed that you would have to reset
Save frames or reset
ACTION starts new game, loses frame on cutscene
Welp time to reset
Me with aryll waves
I'm glad we skip the cutscene of saving her now
Now i can pretend like she drowns in the helmarock cage
Yo what's BN 3 SS?
God I wanna learn a BN game
If I had 293847923 hours
How long is that run
SS in exe2 axlsenS
You don't know how much I love BN games
well yeah, youre comparing with a god there KEKW
The only thing I'd probably not like about BN3 is the bubble man section
How long is BN2 SS?
Why is my obs giving me audio delay issues now it has never done this before
nope, no idea LUL
Look, BN2 is my favorite one
Magnet Man's area gives me hot flashes
I love that theme
Does SS have manip?
did you do a glitch? gdqVAC
SS only has 1 manip at the start to get the style. And Jugoomba came up with a neat new manip right after the tutorial to get Dashes
But neither are required
BN2 just gives me life
I should go follow you on my alt
So it gets you closer LUL
Check your followers real quick
Style manip is even less important for BN3
hi new to the channel, definitely not an alt
yo thanks for the gift sub taco!
We love new faces here :)
I know all about gambling
The entire final dungeon is a casino
gamble gamble fast fast
when are you doing gamble manip?
welp nobody put money in
no points for them
Bro I'm at work rn and right when I joined some one spilled soda all over themselves NotLikeThis
You know why I hate moles
I'm still mad that i last locationed that final item
And it was at moles
I spent 45 minutes looking for that item LUL
I had 6 star spirits and 1 item from go mode
There was also a seed where I was looking for the last castle key..... and it was behind the first blooper check in sewers.....................
That ... I last locationed
set tracker on a timer so it auto marks them off with your PB pace LMAO
I like the idea of 50% vanilla checks but with a slider so you could make it as low as like 5% or something
Missed some checks :(
He dumped the rom contents
You're not even involved in the Z1R community and you're cracking jokes about that
What a time to play rando
I can't believe I got partner during all that LOL
I grinded 163 rando seeds...........................
I'm doing a OoT archipelago randomizer, I made mistakes
I went straight to it
Because playing with others was the only reason I'd wanna do it in the first place
Just osmething to do with friends
I made poor settings though because I don't know what I'm doing
Second, the first I did basic settings
one piece taught me how to say archipelago LUL
Raquiem of Spirit gave me Requiem of SPirit, what a rip off
(I need Song of Storms...)
I said "group of islands"
I did Shrubsanity and my Boomerang is in a Song of Storm grotto
Phantom when are we doing rupee/pot/song sanity?
I know it fairly well, but some things I blank on entirely
I'd learn that category, but I'd wanna skip Forest Temple cause I hate that place
Majora's Mask is what I'd wanna do but the randomizer is jank
I would only be interested in run Links Awakening Switch
id do glitchless tho
yeah I know, I used to watch it
The last time I ran it, my 1:10 was a top 3 time. Then d2 hinox warp was discovered
And it became a 33% chance your run continues
no way! Ice Streams phanto274Thonk
Yeah I paid for a custom prime badge
thats what I thought 4Head
I have no idea why obs has decided that audio delay will be an issue now but it's very annoying
Yeah Phantom you'll never see me run LAS
My capture card never did this before
That game is not fun to run anymore lmao
Wow this guy splices more than I do
Just inject Shiver Mountain into my blood stream
Then top it off with CK
CK is my favorite track in the game
he can still block Pog
when i ran through the glundo route this part says you can equip damage dodge and block one "if youre a literal infant at paper mario"
actually made me want to get the block down
my all time favorite is "blow up the rock and talk to the sun"
Why did kooper just stand on you
Kooper ain't no Shadow Peach
oops I crashed my wii u
I hit the wrong button while charging something
also charged for 5 seconds longer than I should but that's besides the point LOL
"Follow the channel plz"
Oh heck it's 9
like and subscribe for more hacked content
imagine living somewhere where it's 9
Look i'm poor okay
West coast too expensive
The good thing about central tho
Is that flights are like equal price if you go to either coast
My vegas flight was like 180
Smh didn't go to GDQ
Could of hung out with Iceblue
I just didn't feel like taking time off work for it if I was going to vegas the week after
Literally could of hung out with Ryan and I
*chants* AGDQ AGDQ AGDQ
I will split a hotel with you if you go next year
AGDQ is like 99% Orlando
Land of the gimr
Just go anyway 4Head
Ryan and I will be there
Okay gotta get going. GL on the rest of this really good legit run
double button mash FeelsAmazingMan
You can avoid double button mash and do stick mashing instead :)
mashing is great because one day you max everything and the next you cant lift a damaged mole
real pain from hurricane
"I'm too buff to mash"
You are going to be able to crunch me like a fly at mwsf
watt are you doing :) :) :)
i strongly dislike those guys
but specifically the one that spawns in after monstar
i just forget it exists
glitchless castle kinda sucks ngl
after i learned the any% tricks i like it even less
im ready for 4/4 cannonless btw
dpad up for double jump Kappa
i could think of a few
the luck in these runs has been incredible
I didnt want to interrupt the dark room. I hate that room
dont forget slow go
it's certainly been a run
ive been thoroughly entertained basically my whole work shift now im ready for the conclusion
my immersion is back
2020Party 2020Pajamas 2020Party 2020Pajamas 2020Party 2020Pajamas
Yea my obs has decided to start delaying my audio after a minute I have to play without or mess with my mic setup to avoid the monitor bleeding into the mic
I have never had this issue before this week
gg im glad you decided to force it
I will try monitor and hopefully it's not bad lol
Pause storage gonna be wack tho
I just clicked the button raid me lol
Also get in a call
why are my 7tv emotes becoming small
You're just showing off in case people come in from the Reddit post
lil baby ass pokemon
I have no idea what you're talking about
aw fuck yeah pain
I posted a screencap in phantoms disc if other people don't have the tiny emotes
i'm so tilted about petunia lol
hold up, is that the torture seed i refused to gen for you
she had the diamond stone the whole fuckin time lmao
I love Flower Fields. If I could, I would replace all areeas with Flower Fields. The amount of skill, calculations, and sheer intelligence involved in navigating the many entrances make for the most memorable area in Paper Mario. I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to skip this area or even worse, remove it from the game. The only possible substitute that comes to mind is The Great Boggly Tree, but that is a story for a different day.
I feel like bombette will be a common early partner just to bomb trees lol
what a way to start a seed
is that a flower fields copypasta
I think they're on pretty high
can't even remember the command smh
I remember how to do that command
who the fuck put that there
I totally deserve that and I didn't regret it
the merciful koopa leaf
YOU CAN DO THAT
do I actually not...
How does the pain taste
You've passed me again
I'm like 10 from 400
Oh shit it's past 4 I need to call this uber lol
taco wear that like a badge of honour
I actually need to work rn
lemme make burner accounts Taco
yeah, I kinda need that though, I still need to write 10k letters today for 2 last minute articles that got thrown at me today
I liked that bug
yeah, that had to be sacrificed for underwater traps
man there are like no drivers here I don't wanna be late to the local lol
taco just mss there
IT'S A FUCKING TRAVEL TOWN WHERE THA CARS
should this situation ever come up again, you can kooper whacka
just be a car yourself stickshamGaslight
it found a driver please take the ride I wanna goooooo
dude I don't wanna write those articles, the pay sucks Madge
Quake Badge without the hammer
off stream practice tonight
watt is good for heating food on the go
this isn't a "single white mom in Illinois" moment
Hey leave Illinois alone
yeah that was discussion today, why not shuffle all the block types, even save blocks
twitchRaid twitchRaid Someone call for a Doctor? MD is in house!! twitchRaid twitchRaid
More Echoes Rando practice for me. Of course I had to join in for max pain
this is the shared hammerless seed?
oh it was added?
The seed was trash. An early-game beam was locking itself and not needed
i still havent looked at the settings yet
do the laki clip into final bowser room KEKW
I always get a kick outta people taking to the bot
the what kills me andyLUL
bots are starting to become people
the bot will one day replace Phantom and he'll never be seen again
bots are taking over
monkeys at a typewriter, but you keep adding features
with deep fakes and stuff
Lyft is gettin the same nothing uh oh
...how that Koopa fly with no wing movement?
you just sleep and fly, ez
lmao imagine, just a bird swarm taking a nap, hovering menacingly
yo!! ChronoX is getting smart watch support!!!
my watch will truely become a PET
sharks sleep and swim. same difference
your tracker looks wider than normal
is this just settings cranked to max?
how many seeds for ch6?
I just realized I haven't said sNeed yet
What's the new stuff
gdq runs could never do a rando with 1 key
Oh wow how many 10 coin blocks are there even
Ooh I see they got starting equipment in too
never seen 72 star points gained
Eldstar with the vanilla ability
the last important one is the ch6 seeds
other than that mostly bugfixes ... and random pitch LUL
sounds like a pretty cool update
I see that there's also one that changes the seeds needed to open door
Ah and if they're planted already they're not in the world to find
It's not as if there's 4 seeds and you need 1, but there's 1 seed and you need it
that's a new situation to be in
Are all the big chests boots/hammers?
It's really cool that these equipment config options give both tougher and easier options for folks
i mean, it is 3 in 5 that you get the hammer in the mansion
You can start with the ability to get panels, or you can do the opposite and leave a hammer behind
3/5 chance it's a hammer right
How would you get out of toad town
How many places can you go without jumping
what if you start with nothing and end with nothing?
Can't enter the mansion here, stairs
If you had Parakarry
Well only 1 way to find out
oh, before i forget, some news from the dev discord
dev team has come to an agreement to get full hammer/boots shuffle implemented in full
I like anything that adds something big to find
Those are always the biggest moments
Also only 1 bomb, not 3 hits
I'm hyped about full gear shuffle, it has been a discussion for so long
that would also make chapter 5 less likely to be the first chapter you can do
bombing the beach is pain
which is not a sentence a expected to type ever
you hit 400 followers
no local for me I love this town
BN3 BN3 BN3 BN3 BN3
that's like 40 seconds fast
I hate this town a whole lot but if I move out I don't have money to travel
you know what my favorite part of this rando is
the fact that you went and made a full tracker, bug fixed it a ton, and you use emo tracker instead
sadly the zipline cutscene is such a mess of a script, i was unable to shorten it yet
i was about to say. it LOOKS like emo tracker
chroma keying out the background?
Oh never noticed that
I just use the default colors they look nice to me
What do you like more about this tracker v chp specific item tracker
Mate...that key came out of a badge block NotLikeThis
non-suspicious ruins key out of a red block
nooooo the volcano panels
you cannot get to the first panel?
I've had my account since 2012, so...
There's an imposter among us
honestly, i had to think about that panel for a moment
holy fuck defend plus is 1???????
okay this seed is free
all my seeds lately have been laki start, feels lime a waste for me to have it
what if YOU'RE trash
you didn't even start with extra fp and health smh
water stone reminds me of vaporeon :)
mario should be the mailman. he does every other profession so why not?
everyone is so rude
I can't believe this
You appear to be in a "amused but not happy about it" mood.
I can't BELIEVE this
Cheating on twitch dot tv
Job interview went good. I'm at plasma now phanto274BLANKIES
so wtf do I do with my day now I was ready to be gone until midnight
People seem to have found a replacement for vrchat already lol
THey crashed the servers of it because 10k people tried to join at once
How is the seed so far? phanto274Sip
Yeah especially since they removed blocks
i wonder how hammerless will feel with gear shuffle
Hey streamer what will you do if you acquire goombario?
Could that have been a blue block
if someone pays me I'll do seed where I use goombario only
There's not enough money in the world rigby
Oh wow you have to fight this dude if you get the hammer
damn twitch not paying you enough or what
Just homeward shroom 4Head
that could've been a super block
unless you homeward shroom
they only react to jumps, so it would be moved up when spawning
that was an upgrade block in my seed yesterday
I should do one of these tonight
Can't wait to get stuck for 5 hours
Since I'm not gonna cheat like SOMEONE here
We literally just need magic Seed Y to get Chapter 6
Fake Ultra Stone, yep
wait did you reorder the seeds on tracker to line up with in game order?
we all got bodied
blessed. because the original ordering low key tilted me a bit lmao
we're pretty good lately in getting the first tree wrong completely
I mean he's not home..
I have a name you know
phantom, theres a house for sale. Wanna be my neighbor? 4Head
Couple of Flower Savers would be nice
perfectly coded video games
thank you for teaching the younger generation the importance of cheating
It's not cheating if you don't get caught and bowser didn't catch him
I caught him tho
that laki jump is bad
I'll learn then turn on everything
I want laki to hold bombette
the back up isn't too bad if you learn it
mind me posting the clip of Kolorado's wife to the discord, I'm still giggling about it
oh, sure, cap'n can post it if they want
yo nice 3rd try
damn I missed the hammer?
You did that whole puzzle
Just for the coconut
Wait, you have Diamond stone
As he's about to cheat
No idea, I just call races. It hones it my Eagle eye
Are those the evil toads?!? LUL
Mario got that good credit score
I should make a layout where my gameplay is tiny and every part of the tracker takes up the rest
btw how long does glitched of extreme normally take?
fair. since I won't be able to play until 10 but still wanna do a rando
I also suck at glitches so there's that to take into account lmao
Don't be like this guy
I can't help it. phantom is shaping my innocent mind to be like him
don't leave poor Bambotte behind. long forgotten sister
it was a maple
ngl both ices having a shade of blue as their name is tripping me up
so proud of my self, fought dark mega with just shadowman
well I saw you missing 1 fp
so I put the pieces together
why'd you kill him
pls be required....pls be required.....
uh oh, red vase
the god seed. both bombette and watt are good
I played enough rando to know there is always a catch when the seed is good
what're these bp costs jeez
scarf is in outpost shop, ye
Scarf was in DDO shop
no wonder the shop in the literal desert can't sell a scarf
hey the scarf can keep the sand out of your mouth and eyes
random pitch pop diva is a blessing btw
your bp costs are horrible what the hell
you bought garbage, it's a fair trade
what about the upstairs item in the sand
ah. the jump isn't too terrible
kind of weird, no Parakarry so no letter delivery, no koopa legends so no koot favors ..
time to reroll the seed
karma for all the cheating
"goodbye" is the first thing i heard upon putting my headphones back on
the county has asked me to come back for another assignment late next month
legit, I am considering a goombario only seed, someone talk me out of it
sometimes good things happen
this is the most money i've ever made
Good for M4, bad for rigby
could be an in to a government job too
Rigby, don't do it
If you do it, you're uncool
I'm a tsareena player ice, I'm already uncool
I need to play more
I smell a danger setup
How far are you into rank?
vet, I didn't play this season yet
i need a duo
I just gathered emblems and that's all
oh you don't know
it's like sonic adventure 2
i love that game
gacha essentially for emblems, and you equip them for extra bonuses
hi to you too ice
emblems is why people run shell bell now
lemme get the credit card...
hello there how is the run doing :D
it's a reason to use the energy system or whatever
gacha is 0 syllables away from gotcha
hmm maybe I need a gen a seed now
cool down reduction is way too powerful
dive cram has 0 cooldown
the cheaf gave you the lucky coin
you found the money store
Rigby come explain all the new stuff to me
welcome to money store there we give money
i'm too stupid to read
alright gimme a sec
Hmmm, methinks either Master 1 or Chapter 3
i'm not denying it...
para where r u bawkSad
deep para with letters sounds interesting lol
para final item from koopa koot
i totally forgot about the room to the left of here
para in 6 round 2
you can ban me
if it's actually true
he's too sexy aha
if i call that
For those just coming in, a reminder that 3 seeds were pre-planted
parakarry behind water stone, you're good
just be careful ryan, annie is very territorial saberaSweat
i can observe and not touch
Found the mail turtle
ace or not, they'll fight iceblueLUL
Jibca managed to convince me to play dnf again
Rando mailman % let's go
that's 3/5 of all letters
I finished my trials for dragon knight and she's cool
how about i dont even start
can't start if i'm already finished
For some reason the little baby bitch dragon spinning does like 20% LOL
looking at your input display it looked like you pressed both to close the partner menu, then only pressed cright when trying to lakijump
Mario has a squeeky clean.... nevermind
off by one glitch input lol
money does grow on trees
Goombario could charge if you really wanted
do it coward. ice won't give me permission to use goombario but you should take it
Yeah he'd have to go upgrade, if he really wanted
That's a time loss
No one loses time here
if you're upgrading goombario you've lost a lot more than time
probably in the palace
i mean 2 seeds ago
i had red key.... in the red key spot
i swear that one is real
btw ice I got like 10 min if you still want me to explain the new unite shit
it's about as real as your bn3 run
how much to talk you into a serenade run?
everyone has a price
Ok so what's the price
Got more interesting just now, Star phanto274BLANKIES
I made Glenn type out Slugma on his Pok'mon keyboard
I saw the opportunity
you actually have mega rush?
He didn't have these for multi I missed them
yo that's good for bowser!
I should just do windwaker but I'm waiting to see if coney does anything i want to watch lol
Koopa Koot loaded, sheesh
coney guessed a carrie underwood song immediately on heardle
he really is white
I saw you got koopa koot stuff
Rigby and I giggled
gdq told me going to chapter 7 is very bad
I believe in you
they did another pape rando one the gdq channel?
what a silly guy
It was hard to watch
Like no shade to the guy but like I just want them to have a pape player showcase it
was it done by the same guy like the first time?
yo rando race next time?
mh. no clue how the gdq channel works. maybe they were the only ones submitting
His estimate was a 3:30 starting with 15/30/30 and only needing 5 star spirits
4th ruins key will have palace key
no clue how casual the gdq channel showscases are. maybe they don't actually want a speedrunner wreck a rando?
lets GOOOOOO palace key
My sub JUST ran out but I can't prime
oh i see who it was
won't name drop, but yeah
i can see the favortism
I can also tell you they are friends
the host and the person
Feels like numbers and friends are what get you into gdq a majority of the time
And kinda hard if you don't got the connection sometimes
@TacoGuyy not always true, I was able to get in with a Challenger Approaching
but only because I previously commentated on a show before for the same game
Ik it's not impossible to get in
Just seems to be a heavy screw towards the favortism side even keeping in account the new peeps
dude the mayor went out of his way
to continue the trickery
The mayor places every bomb in rando
i can wholeheartedly agree with some things like a person who isn't familiar with a game, getting to showcase it
like i'm going to be LIVID as fuck, if someone gets BS Legend of Zelda into GDQ because they received the GDQ raid and was playing it
who also knows literally nothing of the background of the game
like, i routed the game with jsr, and i grinded that game. i went learned all the lore and typed up a full document of the global drops
and someone jumps in runs it for 2 weeks, gets the GDQ raid, and everyone is like HEY YOU SHOULD SUBMIT THIS GAME
NGA but now with glitches
oh uhhh lemme get it
i'll do comms for your bn3 ss run
i don't even know anything
mayor is out for blood with this palace gromfaKekin
Yeah I can watch a 1am rando
Yea I'm confident in covering everything for WW but having you there will just be nice lol
using discord for discord things?
tf is wrong with you
"I knew that was a trap I have the D!"
Thats to be expected
Some days you just want more apparently
whens phantom quote bot
Sometimes you just need twice the D
here it comes y'all
38k points away from VIP
7 traps in palace
What item are you looking for?
I didnt count but it sounds right
Child murder is ok if it's in toad town
Ok coney is reactioning so I will play ww
have fun finding the bullshit
No I cant say I have
Ok.. 2/3 still possible
1/3 is passing if everyone in the class failed and the prof curves it.
Calc 2 was rough.
it'll be a fake parakarry
so i can get banned
Oh I got 0 from the prof in the lecture. Also ended with a 32% and didn't pass with the curve cut off of 33%
When was the last time you got an item
Yeah a not bad professor makes quite a difference
Thats not a real item
Hidden block outside of Koop village?
Unsure if it's better or worse if that's it
how'd he get there
what channel did you say that friday thing will be in?
There's an imposter amogus
o/ lurking today has been nice cuz axle hasn't been chatting
My main goal is to blow up
Saying my name and telling someone 'no'
what if i call you number 15
goomba king is also a culprit
what are you checking last?
ALL THE HOMIES HATE MOLES
Wait so you didn't need to deliver a single letter?
What an extreme seed
I suddenly don't wanna do a pape rando tonight
Cause moles will have something
And I'm gonna hate it
listen I literally played the game for the first time ever in January
my rando race time is competitive in rando races
I do flarakarry and the one in Ch3 with parakarry
thats the only gltiches I know KEKW
Gotta do the ch5 block to skip the water block puzzle
yo turn this bop up
iceblueRave iceblueRave iceblueRave iceblueRave iceblueRave iceblueRave iceblueRave iceblueRave
better luck next time
6 fp for jump charge
Gotta keep that dizzy dial
damn too bad we don't have dodge master or something...
I have no idea if it does or not
I Just went watched the vod
How did you lose repel so quick
That's what we call a scam
Feeling fine + repel
woah peach in the crystal palace
wow feeling fine sucks
what a shit badge
toss that shit in the trash
Well, it's actually just trash.
Wait did I walk into buttcheek
what even is that last one
ive never heard of it
Ezekiel2 Ezekiel2 Ezekiel2 Ezekiel2 Ezekiel2
Salty send back phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
tubba key behind red jar
Hey phantom!! Good luck
Hello! Hope you get the good RNG!
oh god that did not show up on stream LOL
I guess you were just focusing on hating starting with Goombario. XD
taco threatened me, I swear
you are just a hater
wait what'd I do lange
the self-promo channel is a threat
taco pinged everyone in there lol
Imagine if the RNG was so bad that every partner other than goombario cost like 6 star pieces from Merluvee.
I'm trying to draw, so I'll be lurking. here but lurking phanto274Lurk
go get spook and come back lmao
just get to one lol
okay how about no, bot
I'm down for that Bomberman game and category
The heck is Mario Glider?
and Bow has no idea
wait we have Goombario!?
just beat antiguy lmao
So far all the seed checks have been traps. XD
The bot will stream soon
he is a rando player
how could it be impossible
how do you already have 3 seeds
how much health do the shy guys have?
do you have any shooting stars
I take it the third hammer check is in that place behind Goomba Village?
just grind levels 4Head
well if you had two shooting stars and a life shroom/repel gel you would need
or one level so you could get enough fp for outta sight
Can't wait till they eventually add a setting that makes it possible for hammer and boot upgrades to be anywhere.
how is blue station of toybox block3d off?
theres the first shooting star
kooper said fuck you
now just grind to level 2
now just life shroom or repel
theres the life shroom
it wants you to kill those shy guys
I like how it's all falling perfectly into place.
wtf is with these traps
Miyamoto said you better fucking play my game
He made this seed himself
Wow you actually got a palace key this time
Goombario is looking after you
He even gave you 69 star points
but thats a shroom cake
not so gourmet anymore i gues
more like cake guy
Why he gotthat up his ass
The trap i frames saved you from the encounter :)
"It can't be that hard" THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED
those locks are huge though
Seeing pink station done with parakarry out and not clipping is painful
cause it's not even hard
it was smash charge
can you even go to red station without hammer
this is gonna be the first time chapter 6 has been cleared first ever
dont you need watt to fight fuzzipede
this is actually going to be the fastest chapter 6 clear in randomizer history
I dont understand these settings at all
why is the super block a coin block
the answer to what's on is yes
but why is the super block a coin block
so they can be anywhere
has to be a multi coin block
Is it really rando?
Is it really pallos
Off to great start
Hey I gave you 10 whole seconds this time
I appreciate shorter time
I gotta head out, goodnight!
Hops on fence and breaks reality
You're right, it could've
Makes sense to me
And skips entire world
Damn she said fuck you
Thats a lot of dudes
She had to walk backwards lmao
How much would Zap Tap have to cost to be equipped?
Yo the best attack FX? Pog
What is that key?
You found her frying pan she gave you her credit card, fair trade?
Game wanted to make sure you could pick up that pebble LUL
Mario juggler of coconuts
Do you have everything to beat chap 4?
What does it say when the hotel staff leaves /you/ a tip?
im starting any% tonight tho so different pain
would you say this run is better or worse than yesterday?
Does that mean Anti-Guy is scaled up as well?
all bosses rando run rn
that drop attack is actual cheating
oh yeah i forgot about the wind too
man buzzar kinda sucks
wait they added dropping?
Is that in vanilla or the mod?
every time i come here i learn something new FeelsAmazingMan
no i missed it
wouldnt it stop claw poson
No not feeling fine again
parakarry is under there
Not only did he lose all those letters, he lost himself
Parakarry for the mailbag would be funny
parakarry final koot favor Prayge
shouldnt be prying into other people's business
what do everyone love
oh yeah i'm all over it
love that garbage ass garbage
i guess i missed that in the update notes
Yo, backtracking? I didn't know this was TTYD
i thought the boss was the eruption
must have been crunched for time
parakarry def drowning by blue baby yoshi
Are we saving the Yoshis today?
should take the meal
but only to explosions
Oh god tomorrow is friday
how much garbage do you want for comedy
like do i veto a mandatory gk seed or something lmao
i'll gen some this weekend
i'll try to make it interesting combat wise but not too painful on the backtracking
goombario start, got you
It started with goombario and you didn't make a new seed?
green station actually blocking progress imagine
kinda sick upgrade spot this should be vanilla
Even more mandatory than Parakarry LUL
Take off P-down for All-or-nothing?
Does the light hp scale?
FWIW that one branch in Flower Fields has 9 checks
There was one invis block you didn't check on Yoshi beach
Try starting a little lower?
It's up to try
Sits up ffs siri
it looked like you were oob and fell the full time and respawned
so it tried to spawn you oob
makes me think maybe right is correct
Is there a way to get up there with Ultra Boots?
idk though i've never tried this
Nomadimouse I believe, also you got a letter to Franky (don't know if you marked)
In the weekly async, it was the same story. Apparently he was at the end of Crystal Palace LUL
if i have blue but not red after a number of hours that honestly makes me more likely to go to 7
Buy out tunnel man
To be fair, I think a lot of this was in logic a while ago
You had early chapter 6 and iirc the yellow berry was just on the beach
I want to say it was also in 5 but I'm not sure
Why are those shells moving? monkaS
Did not know those moved when you shock Tutankoopa
It would be nice if volcano blocks break when you open the chest if it's not a hammer
most chapters seem to have like, one glitch that gets you to most of the chapter
Glitched logic could lead to less backtracking, but I feel like it could also lead to more...
not even go mode
Blue key time YEP
they didn't give you star points
have you checked moles
my 100% correct prediction rate
for me the hardest thing is memorizing which koot npcs are active and able to give me their item at any given time
hes a nice guy
I still think a setup could maybe be found to get on the bed
im so tired and its only like 9:30 pm for me
at least I can get some good sleep tonight
he signed the mushroom
I couldnt beat master 3 in my casual playthrough
Master 3 is probably not in logic but the other 2 probably are
You're missing Fortress Keys
Have you? I wasn't sure
dang hes salty about that loss
so angry he smited you
dont be so rude hes complimenting you
Fitting timing on the bot I guess LUL
whenever someone uses the WeLovePrologue emote it says that
it has a cooldown tho
Do you go by Phantom?
because prologue is hypnotizing
prologue brainwashes the masses
your friend literally wants to be pokemon
one day the bot will say something with cocnut in it
Do you have the blue key?
wow... thats desperation haha
I love nacho fries
I just learned about nacho fries last night when my friend ordered them--so gooood
why does taco bell keep it off the menu they could make bank if it was permanent
I feel like you must have hit all the replenishable checks outside ch8 by now anyway
or is it permanent now
Someone said earlier you missed a block on the beach
do you have merluvlee on?
did u give rigby the seed baf00n gave u
have you been doing radio
just tell rigby its a bad seed
rigby is live rn i think
realistically if I saw a coconut check I would ignore and forget it
if this is something useful it will be the first time I've ever seen it happen
You know what would be really rough this seed? Shy Guy items in Blue Station can be replenishable
What was on the Parakarry roof in Blue station again? I remember you considered coming back for it but it might have just been a badge
anti guys most valued possession
we love master 3
do every other check before master 3 because it will be funnier
what if master 3 gave you luigis autograph
that would be funny
oh nice i took a nap and you're still going Pog
Do you actually have 1 of items you need and didn't mark it?
lol we dont wont a repeat of the "third" ruins key fiasco
change ResidentSleeper to be mario in bed
I don't think you can change Twitch globals but you can have extension emotes like Bedge
oh yeah I forgot about Bedge
send this seed to rigby lol
rigby did not see it all though
still send it lol
wasnt d down jump a win tho
Did you do prologue panels?
I spy is off?
can you ask merluvlee for a hint?
did u do cocnut check?
checks pass jade raven
no way it's a shop
no blue berry means theres a replenishable spot somewhere past where you are in logic?
Goal was sub 6, I smashed it!!
Did you check both blocks when you went back to beach? I think you hit one, assumed you hadn't missed it, and left
blue berry is pretty much free, so I can't see why you'd not buy them
Also, did you ever check the Ultra blocks here?
ultra boots blocks on shiver mtn?
ultra boots block on shiver mountain?
YEP last place you look
dude my little brother just asked for my help with a fly
After repeatedly mentioning it too oof
hes so scared of them its hilarious
where was luigis autograph
I walked away for a sec--did koot give you the letter and then it was a trap??
Cake mix was in a shop... Chapter 7 maybe?
I'm positive it was a shop, it was one you mostly cleared out too
It might have been Yoshi's
I think I've never gotten far enough in the chain to need kooky cookie
I completed the whole chain in my casual playthrough
I hate that stupid turtle
I hate how you can't read the news ahead of time
it's not like it changes
there should be community written messages on the newsz
honestly making it the pro tips from the website would be kinda cool
it should be all 57 of zote the mightys precepts
now thats over I can celebrate with ribs LUL
I'd be surprised if it's not
I wish I liked meat because so much stuff with meat looks good
idk what it is it just doesnt taste good
Yo, 4 and a half hour run wow
So this is all sanity?
i dont need it.... i dont need it...
youre like a man crawling through the desert right now
Should be Yoshi's shop
I just remember the shop being half-cleared out
what about boo shop
it was somewhere stupid
I think it might have been in toybox
I remember seeing it when I was still in stream at the beginning
does it have to be in a shop or could it be a tree or bush?
thanks old man for nothing
whats wrong with dusknoir
imagine if ch7 wasn't locked behind koot
and that was the only missing item
go mode, if you can even call it that, haha
i kinda knew it?
i said toybox for cake mix but I will take what I can get
Wait is it actually a feeling fine play?
never feeling fine again
inb4 the skipped defend plus was 1bp or something
is 3 vanilla? that seems high
p up d down?
p up d down is 2
clover's chapter scaling does not always perfectly match the vanilla numbers
so it could be 2+1
Whenever I watch the mash out of the tuff puff attack, I always can't help but remember Stryder's mashing out of it in Master Quest
does that work will all AOE?
it's specific to how fast the AOE attack works
mega bomb, pow block, fire flower is what works
interesting! I know so much about this game but theres always more to learn =)
it was mega bomb that I discovered the behaviour from but then went back and retested all
the funny thing is, I didn't test pow block at first, because I never knew that it worked on flying enemies
that shocked me to find out that it does
if youre playing with settings that require bowser castle keys, can a bowser key be in star haven? or blocked behind something thats blocked behind something in bowser's castle?
I'm confused how the lemon was in ch8
because lemon is required for ch2 in logic, I thought
how extreme has the pain been
lemon or lime works
that wasn't my understanding and the logic at least doesn't know about lime working
ooh, that's a nice palette for Peach
iirc only one lemon in the entire pool though
good luck with extreme pain BegWan
that's why I'm so confused
hmm, a quick google seems to suggest that lime doesnt work
he just calls you a good person then tells you to buy dried shroom and dusty hammer
oh is scarcity turned on
yo! my steve amiibo drops on sept 9th
man down bad enough to check peach library
just checked--default extreme shuffle has no scarcity
just remembered moustafa is not needed for ch2 lol
moustafa is a lame phony
why are all the blue skins for characters so good
maybe its because blue is awesome
cuz blue's the best color
big blue fan here
not the mario kart track I just like blue alot
does that mean the letter is the crystal berry checkin
that's like, the only place you didn't look
The bot is tired of this seed
actually true and topical message bot
He said end this shit now
is the bot AI generated messages?
heal then shield then heal
finally, the classic paper mario experience in a rando
looks like it is possible
Just get lucky 4Head
Ah, I see Final Bowser also is giving you trouble
they did but you used them on master
I guess this is a reason to savescum before fighting master
you just need to get obscenely lucky
quick change woulda won you the fight
What a lucky day.
No luck all skill
Go buy a lottery ticket
every opportunity is presented by luck, it takes a true master to take hold of that opportunity and turn it into a success
but yeah you got stupid lucky
Is this for sure the same seed?
You went there for cake mix and I don't think they were there
look where red key is to confirm
Will you post a vod?
one of my friends is doing casual bn4 but he hasnt started yet
you gotta play xeno tho
never seen that yakkey menu icon lol. gl hf
oh, I have to correct myself, the current race particitpation record is 11
Could probably clobber together a tool to do that automatically
That's how it's done in z3 rando if you want more features than what the main site offers
uh did the race settings change? i think block shuffle is on
it says so on the seed page
1 FP Power Shock? Again?
ohoho, we got Rando Randy sNeeds?
i always seem to be going to donate plasma when you stream on sundays BabyRage
I love all of your paper Mario Streams I enjoy every minute of it.
Yo at least we both consistent
Taco had a fine run yesterday
That's a lot o star pieces
Nothing early boots can't fix
howd the rest of the marathon run? I had to leave about an hour or so in
Do you have traps on?
which partner did you start with today?
Imagine it's forced Yoshis Kappa
The Boos are selling Bow lol
Hope there's nothing on that one Kooper block in the volcano I guess lol
is this a new setting?
are they planning to include ? blocks or non-coin brick blocks?
I hope it just a Mushroom on the block in the volcano.
I forgot to tell you that your mystery? usage yesterday was incredible
I hope you had a great weekend.
I saw your Pokepark run not too long ago and found it intresting
bp is balanced random
90% +-2 same weights, 10% fully random 1-8
I hope the power plus badges have lower bp.
yeah that's probably a game
O fish! can i eat it
I think that's still one of the not-bad Harvest Moons too
can i eat the fish?
back to nature is the PS1 title
can i eat the turtle?
can i eat a cocnut?
why is there not a cocnut on tracker?
if traps r on then it trap
nothing can be vanilla
traps should be on for race
CAN I EAT IT
More Cocnuts. I wonder if he would be here on Mount Rugged.
y did u not pick up the cocnut on mount rugged?
Howdy. YouTube vods brought me here HeyGuys
the classic rando gamble
I am now in love with twitch you have all of my support <3
Been watching for a couple weeks, cool to catch a live one!
what a merlow shop
There he is .
As early as you got Super Boots, it's also possible Merlow is earlier in logic than you think
if you do LP skip, is it possible to go back and beat them or is your run just invalid
One of the more easier fights.
Should I share what I know about the scaling?
I wonder with chapter will be chapter 7 scale?
There is also just a doc which I always look up
Though I can reaffirm that Fuzzipede is part of ch5 for scaling purposes
knowing the scaling isnt all that important
I guess you can't do glitches in races?
glitchless with an asterisk
I love Watts color.
Want to get off of Mr. Spring's wild ride
@Icebound777 LOL that is a good one.
littering poor Lil' Mouser's shop
I wonder what Ralf will give you?
definitely not in a Nintendo game
How much is Watt's FP moves?
If you mean the one to get to the upgrade room it's not too hard if you just buffer up-left out of the loading zone
You can now get Bow now.
so it's technically left of up left?
that's so bad, holy
Huh, did not know that (I play on emu w/o notches lol)
so you want a worse cotroller for it
why's this not banned for weeklies again lol
IMO the ruins jump is easier than the one jump in Blue Station right side but that's rough if it's controller dependent
They're both definitely doable but I find the ruins jump timing easier lol
I think by now I'm better at the ruins jump for reaching the top right bombable wall that at the super hammer one
Maybe not having notches helps me for that, idk
fly turtle has to show up *somewhere*
I think Kammy looks better blue.
I HIT 6.9K POINTS
You should leave Goombario with the Koopa Bros.
love watching your videos on YouTube 1st time stopping by
I am fuming rn phanto274Rage plasma peeps making me mad
Because their people can't stick my veins well they have to re evaluate my veins.
I'm pretty sure my veins are good. I've donated over a 100 times
have to save up 30k points I played a gross seed today
Wasting muh tiem thisis165Cry
its was really bad
Yo when I do a nasty seed I have my points ready phanto274Lurk
Let's see if you're right
I hope it is 4th ruins key
He could be in chapters 4 or 7.
Stanley is just vibing in tubbas gut
It's nice a warm he can wait
watch him be on goomba king
The case of the missing parakarry clintCry come home mr mailman
para cant be chapter 6 bc it out of logic
Idk bout you but beating up the moles is fun Kappa
para not with moles
para not in this chapter
I don't understand how the logic works ngl. Not very logical for my brain
just copy message bot says and reply to it
8bp last stand still worth
Wot he can upgrade stuff? For coins??
I never knew that ralphTato
Chet Rippo doesn't exactly upgrade for coins
he gives you 2 levels for your chosen stat, but reduced the other two stats by 1 levels worth
i hate checking dry dry desert i always miss something
That doesn't sound worth phanto274Thonk
Dark fuzzy? Bot what you on about lmao
my 1st rando i miss red key there i was looking forever for it
Might be Anti guy.
Where did you miss it? @blacktiger51
Man if it is anti guy that would be so mean
Oh I see clintT
So replenishable cake mix is a tell then! Or just a coincidence of a placement
@PerMitzi ummm think it was in a invisible block
@blacktiger51 Jeez! You found it tho! Must have been a good moment haha
@PerMitzi i had to check the spoiler log i was about to quit
@blacktiger51 oh man the spoiler log is such a life saver. I look at it when I get stuck and then feel dumb
Where oh where is parakarry
@buff00n SHSHSHSHSHSH listen I give up sometimes clintCry
@PerMitzi i just checked everything but i am bad at desert i was thinking i found everything i even use panels and that easier to remember
@blacktiger51 desert is rough I totally agree. So many checks.
yeah, every rando has its bad checks
i always do pit if i am able too i hate going back
WOW parakarry what you doing there
Pit is no place for you clintNo
i would of skip pit if i was playing this seed
in other randos doing bad checks intentionally is called clown routing, lol
if you was allowed to cheat in the weekly race it probably wouldn't matter if you didn't get him
I like checking everything because I like seeing the tracker x that place out
Out of all of the randomizes I watched this my most favorite one.
yeah i think paper mario rando is my favorite
Did you catch HO-Ho?
I am of to bed have to work tomorrow I hope you have a good night.
So would you have leveled up if you hadn't encountered that Goomba?
ah, yeah that'll happen
so basically just chapter rush at this point
what all bad checks did you end up doing?
that's not too bad, though i get the feeling if you get train, anti-guy might have something
I gave up lol where was parakerry?
ah, must have missed that
pit wont have anything... i left
damn, I couldnt done ch3
oh boy, mysterious not
oooh, 1 bp bounce
the note is so dumb that it in logic
sounds like a lot of unnecessary logic items
I'm all ears from logic changes. You just have to write it into the discord
sounds like it's easier if you know, but if you don't it makes no sense
just pray their nothing
i do like the new addition of mixing the upgrade blocks and brick coin blocks
anti guy should require watt for logic
i can get behind that
i like the block shuffle tho
forced to think differently
life shroom is decent
3 more items for go mode
is cake mix in logic if you can buy it or if infinite for the fat shy guy?
weirdly though he doesn't want Nutty Cake
i'm guessing we don't wanna do blue if we don't need to
it's one check, iirc
the technicality is the Nutty Cake isn't called cake in JP, but the other 3 cakes are
i'm still getting used to paperando
No progression behind Blue Key IF you already have Red Key
ah, that makes sense
doesn't blue key give you some red keys check if you don't have red key
If you have Blue Key but not Red Key, it's like 4 (?) checks
now soil, then train
last time i seen the blue key use was when you use it the 1 time i had no idea when it was for since before Rando like 10 years old was the last time i use it
food just got here, so gotta run. glad i could catch one of your streams again!
maybe 1 day we will get a real paper mario tyod rando like open like 64
some of the games flag are dumb like going back to chapter 2 and doing super boots later and it set you to chapter 2 even if u was end game
it probably took alot of work to do it
i still wonder how we can push the time down
most rando players seem to think 2:30 max is a decent time for rando races in general (e.g. OoT rando)
3 hours is not too bad
we might sill have to adjust logic for that to work decently
currently you hit go mode at a point where you have several chapters left
I mean, the zelda randos just have dungeons that are meaningless for game completion. the pearl dungeon in WW, the pendants in OoT or alttp
@Icebound777 but what if you need a item on master sword check in lttp
I could see something work, like, mark two chapters as beaten already
we'll have to see. maybe full gear shuffle is our miracle cure, who knows really
i cant wait for full gear shuffle
Turning off keysanity would definitely make things faster but IDK if people would find that fun
Maybe also lowering the seeds needed for ch6? Though early ch6 might actually make seeds take longer
@MarioManTAW i wouldn't play without keysanity
I do think 2 seeds required would be good for race settings
keysanity in any rando is the way to go for me
yeah true, but i'm crazy like that lol
i like key sanity in zelda
keysanity in the SMZ3 rando is pretty fun
Yeah I definitely wasn't suggesting that was the way to go lol
z3 has a mode for that
my 1st oot seed was everything on i had a blast i did cheat alot
I do think the best, easiest first change for race settings would be reducing the number of seeds required
i think pape's dungeons are too linear to try to turn it into zelda rando
Most other chapters require 1-2 items to enter but 6 requires 4 which makes it very late game
maybe allowed cheating in races
my 1st rando i cheated
i'm a casual player, so i just watch to see them happen, not necessarily do them myself
tbf there isn't much race rules discussion in general
but i do watch you all the times and most of the glitches you do are really easy
or any discussion besides logic or suggestions
i think the only one i do is water geyser skip, cause that puzzle is boring
hardest glitch i did was blue house skip using a toad
in the end, pape rando races is the niche of the niche of the niche anyway. we're 800 people on the discord, compare that to the 60k on the oot rando lol
1st glitch i try was cilppy to get into raph area
i can definitely tell by watching that 90% of the glitches are super easy
such a well programmed game, amirit?
it was funny cuz the jade raven was behind the tree
i didn't have the fish tho
even just 1 seed
3 is too close to vanilla
Technically no other chapter requires more than 2 items to enter so...
yeah, 2 or 1 would be best for 6
i don't even remember what the rest of bowser's castle looks like anymore
hopefully in glitched logic we wont have to blue house skip without hammer
me when boss rush castle and see's bowser key: weegee3Hmm
yeah, definitely have a glitch toggle for required glitches for logic
can't stick around, gl on the bowser rng
the VARIA randomizer for SM does the same
I'm fine with toad or laki blue house skip
i forced myself to learn short speedboost to progress
bro, I blinked, then hallway Bowser was DEAD
hallway bowser got devoured
so i know you play on real hardware, but how do you get the overlay for your controller with that?
Is it possible to kill phase 1 bowser or would it just crash the game?
i need me an everdrive, so i actually have a reason to use my N64
Like how in vanilla if you use cheats to kill bowser in prologue the game just shits itself lol
bowser not being cooperative today
scummy bowser is scummy
i need to finish xenoblade 2 before i get 3
i need to play the 1st xenoblade
1st xenoblade is so damn good
i also need to get live a live
3 looks good i just got my switch this year
insert joke about bn6 punishing for "touching grass"
i should clue mitzi in
nothing much. just taking a break from family visiting today
clue me in about wot
okay so not confirmed this week
just get sub 1 minute
no you cant LMAO
you love to see it
I did basically nothing today for 5 hours today. Jcog morning streams cant come at a better time for me
how how far are you in Xeno3? im trying to get thru the desert rn
yeah, way passed me then
why's there no "sNeed" command?
oh shit, risch at moneyhatz
elementman was -40 off PB
it didnt notify me for this stream
I have never seen the battle network series
Im more of a classic mega man person
I played a pm64 seed today and it was nuts
literally made me doubt the settings I put on
I think I might send that seed to you when I get enough points
it was really wacky
its not really a hard seed its just wacky
the only setting that I will ever keep the same in rando is blue bow
I love that skin too much
I should probably start ttyd but I like pm64 rando too much
cool thing i learned, if you hold ZL you can soom in and out. If you zoom in all the way you can play Xeno3 in first person LUL
not great for fights but a fun way to explore the world
i glance over and risch got a sub 209
ive got the raid msg for the night
I unlocked the skill tree
I fucking love this game tho, that last fight...omg
oh yeah, its soo good
but didnt xeno2 have blades which were characters? I didnt play xeno 2 yet
its on my shelf okay
ill get around to it one day
i thought I was done with chpater 2 after that
yeah, I need to quit now and get ready to go to my brothers for the night
after his trip to scottland, this week he went to the florida keys KEKW
packing up my switch to take it and start kirby
Do I dare click it
I got it a month ago from gamefly for 40 bucks and havent started yet
Xeno3 is the first game in a while that i bought for full price
It is surprisingly tame it's just regular fanart for vaporeon day
oop there's the tits
I dont have a ton of free time this week so debateing for tomorrow, do I do exe2 runs or casual black pit?
I can only stream for 3 and a half hours so it fits that time slot
Wednesday morning at fucking 6am your time is the next pokemon direct
as long as im not resetting i enjoy it
So I will simply watch the vod
I would only wake up for that for rune factory or smashy bros
for me its 9am, ill be up but i doubt its worth my time
the only thing i look forward to with pokemon are the leaks cause im not gonna play the game anyways
The open world part lost its novelty too fast because it was just bland
Exploration should be optional, PLA literally made you grind to do the story
That combat system was SO ASS
Is him choosing to blue screen him wanting to die?
Anyways back to megaman
I'm very glad faust got buffed he got some shenanigans now and it's fun as fuck to watch lol
Depends on how hard the run is and if I'd really feel like doing the last chunk if it's not gonna be worth anything
Like 16 star runs I understand not finishing and shit like that
Oh if you're PAST blj's then yea I'd finish
Slip usually finishes at that point too unless he just decides to run it back immediately
34:09 would get you 4th
current 4th is a 21 so you'd have time
Oh you mean before my b lol
3rd place is a 33:29
May as well take a leaderboard badge
Aw hell yea the weed mario ascii works on twitter dms
Knives said I was bullying her so I just popped a
It makes me very annoyed if it's a god pace
I was fucking livid after losing a 23
cause that shit was just blatantly not my fault and that was just the time I wanted for the game forever
what did I miss/what are we talking about?
oh, one of "those" rants
gotta love bn rng
did I get the right encounter? right draw? did I perform it right? right drop table? so many hoops
but elecswrd is free
you're one of those streamers now OMEGALUL
I did that with my quicksand LUL
for the notes just put "for the meme"
we have some bad heat lightning here.
do you have that over there?
it's dark tho so it's lighting up the sky
I sent a quick video to jeny, I'll pass it your way later
still here, just a bit of work stuff rolled in the last hour
I'd rather not do it when I wake up
I clipped komari once, played back at x.25 and counted 60 LUL
x.50 was still too fast to count lol
Megaman, go touch grass!
you saw the reply on twitter?
if not it's in komari #memes
yeah, we know LUL
how many followers for bn2 KEKW
after cutman it becomes fun... until freezeman
bomb comps are fun but quickman isnt
and gas comps have fun movement
and A license... nevermind that one
Someone just died to bretts nair at 120
and it was not even high up
sounds like dogwater DI
Gnw was trying to mash up b LOL
mine was "I never have to reset doghouse again"
screen shot that one for komari
Gamesbot tries so hard to fit in
guess you won't be raiding jcog anymore lol
Maybe you'll get the raids tho
I could never if he wanted to I start too late lol
I never want to do anything in the mornings
that would require you to finish before him. GOT EM CHAT!!!
just gold it lmao
he golded every split by 10 minutes
YOUR LAYOUT IS PURPLE!!
that's what I use, I just asked first
there was a brief time I used Hikari for split art
MISTMAN has alot of purple OMEGALUL
not a fan Kappa
I love the mistman concept tho
I laughed til you got GBeast down to 120 KEKW
I feel like bn is the only game I can laugh at for bad play
in my bn5 on refights shadowman zipped behind me when I used DarkWide LUL
pls explain, how'd you kill kettle?
I thought only fire could delete it
omg, the latest switch rumor... pls stop
imagine everyone asking for switch pro and Nintendo does Switch Lite 5G LMFAO
would've been kinda cool if they actually did that with the lite, not gonna lie
osu is a hip greeting like "yo"
did you check retro Kappa
I'm going to bed
the intro music is so nice to listen to :D
oh no bad luck
let's hope for a baby seed :D
the all mighty coconut
would be fun if all chapters was vanilla kinda
it's paper wario 64 today
why is paper mario music to catcy
this boost are make for walling
if you guess wrong then you have not played paper mario long enoth
curious to see what you feel about 2 seeds at the end.
i tend to agree with what you said + in discord, will have to try myself soon
something chp6 related !
is that item check skip allowed in races? i dont think i saw it on the list in disc but i could be wrong
ah got it, ty
same for like a block in the tunnels right?
those are good things to want
coming from ZOOTRs, paper rando feels way more punishing. i know i'm still learning fast strats but still, idk
speaking of tricks and slightly off topic, i've been more consistent at clippy tricks and it makes me happy haha
the ruins ones feel soooo good only needing one key so i was like "i wanna learn this" LUL
i did! i actually just watched your vod to learn it lol
learned parakarry-less mt rugged bridge and that felt pretty good
feels kinda partner light rn ish?
that's like the best part of learning a rando though is figuring out how to completely break it lol
it's only becouse we stared with goombario
a Rando Randy sNeeder
currently a celling right now
that is what's up
I'm a funny and ORIGINAL guy
It's less free imo
that's ez to do on discord
that sounds like changing the language on Pok'mon
They don't save that much time overall
They save pains in the ass
I dont think anyone's losing the race because they couldn't save a minute with glitches
i spiraled pretty hard at bowser lol
It just can happen
It's rough when you last location something though.
I can't remember the last time I fought LP in a rando
It took like, 5 minutes to learn. Quicker than a rando LP fight, sometimes.
another trick i learned referencing your vod lol
I have a save at LP with a bunch of life shrooms just to practice blocks because it's harder than bowser for me
Just a peril manip
Aw, kooper did have a thing you needed
Good thing you have hp plus
Oh it was a goombario start?
Doomed from the beginning
If they like double/triple dipping tell em to put the badge on and move along
set them up in a panels race
That's a bit unfortunate
I just had the same thought about that block
Again, not too hard, saves a few seconds of literally just waiting.
Don't wanna double dip on that 1 path?
Oh god did it eat sushie first?
he IS gourmet guy and technically it IS sushi. the logic checks out SeemsGood
we're covered lore wise HahaSweat
'Defeat' high scaled LP
The bot wants you to laki jump you should go get him
'Watt do you mean'
I got convinced to play genshin again and I logged on and rolled ninguangg
You and scorch used to fiend that shit lol
I played until I unlocked co-op and then my friend never wanted to play it again lol
I got Beidou immediately though so I never felt pressured to buy more shit
we'll see how temptation stands when the new char drops tho
I'm just waddling around the world and beating shit up and collecting the sparkle things
Yea they put enough little things to do around the place and random npc camps that it's not boring to wander around
Combat is fun I get to parry with beidou and everything fucking dies
Also I had to reinstall the game fully on my ps4 to get the account to my pc
so that took a while
Cause I never linked it to anything that wasn't psn before I stopped playing it
Why do coneys titles always suck if he's playing multiversus
At least you got the shiny version
What is this close call luck though
Oop got a 2nd live notif for coney and the discord thumbnail is the NotLikeThis screen LOL
Yoooo TombRaid TombRaid TombRaid
exe2 was trash, started super strong with a green doghouse tho
I assume that's why you actually fought that boss
made safety saved but didnt need them
ice fights werre super scuff
It's easy as fuck it should
I GOT FUCKING ELEC
it was tough but great perserverance
also died in aparrtment comp so had to refight freezeman OMEGALUL
I didnt split cause it wasnt a valid SS run
but if I did I wouldve been +16:21 lol
all we need is the funny 4 digits on the front and the 3 on the back
nice thanks for the identity
also crazy thing happened
I 2 turned quickman
told you early game was good lol
just now noticed I didnt stop my local recording KEKW
imagine if cannons were in the enemy pool here
this is just a showcase of what you could do if you WERE cheating
I've only used it in ttyd lol
ive nutted the the prism for 150 hours phanto274Shrug
^ i hope gamesbot repeats that OMEGALUL
150 isnt a lot all things considered
hell, all my complete total play time for single segment is 400 hours. For 4 years thats not a lot at all
Hikari barking at thunder is adorable
im sure it has a good reason
I have no fucking idea
It was at like 4am
is rando faster if you lzs the card?
so its a softlock
last I saw tacoguy had it
phantomgamesbot has a twitter!?!
phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
yoooo, gl with the rando Pog
ooo, that's rough jcogYikes
He does commentary for windwaker runs :)
phantom made the tracker everyone uses PROLOGGERS
YO IS THIS AN ICEBLUE REPEAT
CHAP 7 DOLLY FOR THE KEY
that's pretty hype actually
Required Star Stone check? :O
first time in 250+ hours!??!
Getting the whole last stand setup in like 3 b2b2b checks was neat
That sounds wild honestly. That long without a star spirit
why is there so many people here
that weekend is gonna be fun
we get to meet glenn
AND its a 7 card run, not a shitty 4 card run OMEGALUL
today I got my copy of horizon forbidden west
only 40 bucks from gamefly and its the launch edition
"ill get aroudn to it"
) Dont worry, I still need to learn Inuyasha.
I'll bring your runner/game card to fest as well :D
MWSF is gonna be great. 2D Con too.
The 7s lets gooo
thats why you sleep to 3pm EST lol
i got up at 6pm today its all relative :tf:
I wake up everyday around 4 - 5am
I used to be able to stay up till like 4am. Now I wake up at 4am. Thanks place of employment xD
is that a long comute?
close call bad with danger mario
how's the new settings
Close call should only be bad if you care about peril, right?
it seemed like a weird proposal to me tbh
if you close call final bowser, he will for sure heal
well, 75% he heals but it feels like 95
i've had exactly one run in this game where he delayed heal and it got me a pb
definitely feels guaranteed when it's available to him
can't expect a delayed heal but theoretically he delays it 25% of the time which is a lot really
if only the theory actually worked
if you didn't heal, he would have done fire turn 1 lmao
Is it really a deluxe feast without the Jam n Jelly?
I think part of the reason it feels worse is that some amount of that 25% he puts up a shield
shield > heal :)
this is still more damage than double 3 cap in glitchless lmfao
danger mario too good
does dodge master change power bounce rate?
It's a perfect emote
i had to do a double take when i saw it
I added shit like a few days ago when I was up at 4am
I'm late to the party
el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo is the new GG
what even is shield
damn, still no shield
the only way this fight could be better is if you had feeling fine :)
Bowser is a chipp player, he forgot how to block
Is that faster than the gdq run lol
you running another one?
im going to pog
Do glitches next time
I want you to actually finish chapters
i'm eagerly awaiting glitched logic
that seems like it'd be fun
Jcog ruined this parade for me
Jcog ruined pink pokeys for me
That water bottle is fucking massive
I didn't realize how big that shit was until jesse used it in person
yo a nut cup!!!
insulated bottles are the greatest thing to be invented tbh
yandere dev is ao oni
I was talking in 2 chats
and I switched to this one
lets go best partner
Get goombario'd I guess
load up another seed tbh
immediate bombette and parakarry I wish my seeds were as lucky as that
wait that's really funny wtf
i didn't know that was a thing
nice already cheating i see
wow @TacoGuyy read my mind why dont u lol
Wow, the game is really pointing you to Chapter 2, huh?
i just realized it gonna take a really long time to save up 30k points
i have such a bad seed i kind of just want to tell u lmao
it made me go back to boo mansion and made me fight a chapter 7 jr at lvl 3
I'm down to do it whenever after smashcon
Ye cause I need time to relearn sd lol
and it was no way around it
Hey Phantom! Hope you're having a good day! fifiWaves
@blacktiger51 Pretty sure Chapter 3 Jr is never required in rando
it's strange star hdesNice
i went there to get hammer then got watt from fuzzies boo painting was in chapter 5 boo shop at cake mix and i had to beat chapter 4 to get paracarry from the badge shop to progress
i did blue house skip to see if i don't have to do that and no nothing in chapter 7
i did get last stand there so it was possible to beat jr
do you like randos? I've been wanting to give them a try
oh lmao my bad fifiDed
and on top of that blue key was req fish was looked there but i cheated to get into volcano my jaw drop when i found her
First time gettin' to catch ya live, Been watching ya on youtube with these rando's, and man lemme tell ya it makes me feel like a kid again, Always wondering where the next progression would be.
Can confirm, am from youtube
I'm here from smash bros, I'm the worst type of viewer
I've been following for a little bit, but can never seem to catch a stream lol
Now see, I'd be okay with that you were talking about OG, or Melee (brawl is touch and go) haha
is 8 the max?
8? I thought it was 10
I practiced some pape today yeah
going through making saves for gless again
It's a good emote
what a coincidence me too Kappa
I'm at 79 rn at enter palace lmao
not all of them are for prac though a few are just to hold a spot for story progress lol
7bp power plus kind of worth
still have a fuckton of saves though lmao
i would probably use 1 depending what i have
work's been decent yeah
good enough to where i can stream a tiny bit on the weekdays
only for like 1-2 hours though OMEGALUL
now if it was last stand i would use it even at 10 bp
Wait, I think you can enter every chapter but 6 now O.O
my commute is like 5 mins now
I just woke up from a nap permitZ
Why was he looking at i-no mods
I'm in Breckinridge and I was sleepy ok. And I'm in an air conditioned hotel. What else am I to do
no master key for you
To future me: go the fuck to sleep, you got work later
To future LTScheff: sleep is temporary, pape rando is forever
Honestly I could roll over and go back to sleep cats4eWiggle
You're missing something important but I don't want to tell you unless you want me to
There's something you picked up that's not on your tracker
hello my name is Victor I have ADDHHD OCD AUTISM DEPRESSION SEPARATION ANXIETY AND ANXIETY
I have a Nintendo Wii Nintendo GameCube N64 Nintendo switch and PS4
Oh hey, it's victor
i don't even use to tracker mostly cuz i don't steam
Oh I tabbed out woops
They've started highlighting things for sos
I'm just waiting for mine and then I'm gonna submit to hotfix
i also play on emulator that another reason
i just tried to join the rando discord and realized im already in there wtf
i dont remember this
So many smash players are bitching about multiversus 1v1 meta
That is just not the mode the game was made for lol
all in ez pz
I made a gamble el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
im betting laki for broken rando
Game hates you so early Laki's not gonna happen Sadge
gamble only lasts a few minutes if you want points to make seeds 'n' shit get them votes
watch laki be in volcano
oh even better behind the tree
what are your thoughts on the potential settings changes so far?
it's a great day
oh we doin it
i hate checking 6 so I'm happy it usually late oh wait not for me i always get a early chapter 6
mostly cuz i hate 6 and half of 3
so the 2 magical seeds thing is supposed to make ch6 early more likely?
I know some Shy Guys are replenishable, not sure if it's all of them though
Is that one you can cheat with Parakarry?
<3 Good luck with the run! <3
think it too high up
I am sick with Coviddddd But I'm home streaming all week so that's cool
It's okay! I barely feel sick
could be wrong tho i have no idea how to jump off him
Just positive and isolating
still can knock you on your ass
Yeah covid is no joke. But I have never had the CRAZY symptoms that others have
for some think of the worst cold/flu you had
this trick is kind of hard i try it i was like nope not for me
Still important to get vaccinated and wear masks when around huge crowds
when i had covid it was like every day it would try a new set of symptoms to see if it'd kill me
Yeah the boosters BODIED people who had never had covid
Jeez I'm so sorry @Starry_Arie
i got it once and it clip me back into bounds and i was like yeah I'm good
LOL it's all good i survived CoolCat
Yeah the booster was intense for me too
Okay gunna go pick up food. I'll leave you on :)
Good luck King <3
I am going to spread this emote across twitch
I should add it to ffz just so m4 can use it
what the heck is that
i love it tho
its a trap even tho traps are not on
I am currently decrpyting my legally acquired 3ds CIA's :)
I need more pokemons to rando
Hope I wasn't to annoying to you when I was hosting
It was my first hosting ever and I was nervous
i always fight the pokies then immediately regret it
I just can't with it though
this chapter is awful
remind me why we wanted ch6 earlier? Kappa
THANK YOU @blacktiger51 no one ever agrees with me
the boss is okay if i can power bounce him and beat him in 1 turn
Did we already do Toy Box though
best chapter is 5 and 7
other than bottom left path, ch6 is chill in speedrun
SaVe A fEw SeCoNdS
You... get to beat Chapter 2!
i usually wait a little longer
bro, I got a random influx of YouTube followers because of my Paw Patrol PB video LUL
paw patrol is controversial so youtube promotes I bet
Supposed to be cheating, has 3 chapters in go mode glitchless LUL
just do the English raph skip
i wasnt followed??? uh twitch wtf
My legally acquired roms are now decrypted
how does one legally acquire roms?
I need to learn 4 speedruns this month...I am not looking forward to that
but that thing... it scares me monkaW
I can very easily legally aquire wii/wiiu roms
@Benzene31415 you rip the file from the cd or carts
Same with switch lol
anything on a disc is easy
I already go into the files of shit for switch to mod some things
you cant rip a disc OMEGALUL
exactly, thats what I always do when I need a rom, just checking to see if you guys do it the same way LUL
Buff00n made a dm
thats cool i didn't know that about the gba games
nothing to see here
@TacoGuyy I've been lurking since Phantom entered flower fields
you said the e word Flushed
You have to put a disk in for the gameboy player to work if I remember correctly
All I know is, I popped off when I got a GB Player for Christmas
yeah theres like an adapter
you're telling be the gamecube doesn't have a gameboy lodged somewhere in its carapace?
oh im talking about like the mini game in animal crossing on the islands with the gamecube chord adapter that like connects to the entire bottom of the gameboy
Why not 4? You have cake train bow watt
Oh wait did you do it? Star looks faint to me
Ahhh gotcha sorry just came in during 2
What if rando also changed these gates haha
It also gives you Star Spirit moves, because those are useful :)
I love the 3ds randomizer tho
So many more masochist settings to add for this shit
1.5 good ones out of the whole bunch
Every important battle getting 6 pokemon is so much more fun
I like to set the star power cost to randomize, so sometimes star storm is 1 and its great
just like partner moves!
It's also funny that "Chill Out" is ambiguous even within the context of this one game
don't make the same mistake as komari
I think you already bought from Merlow?
"you can't grow streaming pokemon gen2" OMEGALUL
i remember that it was 3 when you was flighting a blooper
For Port Priority, do I land at 12:30pm ($80 more), or 4pm ($80 cheaper)
He had the Palace Key, I think, but everything worth buying was cheap
you don't need yellow berry?
I have a 7am flight for smashcon
and I'm not too excited
I can be persuaded to land at 12:30pm
What day are you booking buff00n
Are we also still planning to rent a vehicle
I'm down for renting a vehicle
I might come on tuesday idk yet I will book my shit after mwsf
Wait your in Seattle?!?
I miss dicks drive in
Port's Saturday and Sunday, so we'd have Wednesday through Friday to dick around
i've been to seattle, there were plenty of dicks
My best friend went to Seattle prep
why are we talking about dicks?!
Axl you need a bag of dicks to understand
It's the in and out or the whataburger of Seattle
@Phantom5800 it's ok el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
can you get over there with parakarry
2 delux fries and strawberry shake
Ok I have rolled the pokemon Y seed
yes I understand =(
float-perfect, adjective. english: fucking dogshit
Phantom you will be my 2nd pokemon
You better not be ass
My sister is my starter so you can't be that
I hate picking up float perfect, so I dont have a dog
default rival name should be glenn
new bomberman game announced
The professor has a jumpluff
propokH / hey Phantom
nm, how are you? :)
rhythm music game, apple arcade exclusive FeelsBadMan
Go get him then
The homeward shroom says "one tiny bite brings back *memories* of home". So every time you use the homeward shroom you're going deeper inside a memory, inside a memory, inside a memory...
Kooper unlocks completion of 2 chapters glitchlessly and I think 2 more with glitches
Bc of Laki I mean
kooper is used for retrigger prologue
Oh I forgot that characters in this game want to nickname me
What should I make the nickname be
what about using kooper in flood room?
I'll be taking my points now :)
is that sushi replenishable?
I forgot about the gamble lol
But congrats on winning 3k points to sushi voters
i just got back where was the fish?
holy shit I rolled a mega banette starter
he is t posing on the select screen
whos weak to shrink
I've been influenced, I booked the 12:30pm
WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T THE PAYPAL OPTION APPEAR THE LAST FEW TIMES I BOOKED WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES
when you meet IRL do you still call each other by your twitch handles? lol
You had me at pizza
I just call people what I normally call them lol
One Kooper away from go mode?
In my mind i am both names at this point
unless I have to call him Phantom5800
I'm gonna start calling him 5800
you only use the number when your mad, like a parent using a middle name
I'm more used to "B" or "buff00n" than I am "Brandon"
is jade raven behind kooper?
One of the rivals got a weedle lol
My banette has sheer force
you should show off shovel jump
torch the weedle with extreme prejudice
yeah since laki is a jade reven in disguise
I can do shovel jump
u l t r a
kooper is in the pit
@TacoGuyy have you never played KI???
Yea I just want you to shut up
kooper in the pit in a no logic seed
maybe rowf has kooper behind beating ch4
why do you have 17 life shrooms?
Time for your encounter phantom what will you be
You almost got 1 shot woops
Banette got a crit lol
are you doing a nuzlocke?
It's the only way I enjoy pokemon anymore lol
and naming your team after twitch users?
Need to pass Laki twice to beat Chapter 3 before you can get him lol
I usually name them after homies
Phantom you lived with 4/20 health
Wing attack, wild charge, smackdown, magma storm
And you have scrappy
that's a juiced Blastoise
kooper on goomba king I'm calling it
Brookwood I love FIR
learning crystal and bn3 axlsenS
it's sort of replaced Bingo for me
just feels more relaxing and straightforward
i like pokemon but i don't think i would like a pokemon rando
calling at night, want a full night's sleep
if you need a practice buddy/help, let me know BloodTrail I know enough to be competent Kappa
it's only 11:15 but sure
I'm less good at the logic, but make it up in battle efficiency propokWW
if you are eating a can of mixed nuts which one do you go for first?
You dodged a bullet
4x weakness main? My man, that's my style propokH
The next pokemon was castform in that grass
cashews are the goat
that's a lot of damage on that Dome
guessing you were Elixir rich too?
This grass patch sucks ass besides this blastoise LOL
don't sleep on the dam
You aren't allowed to be furry bait
that thing saved me in a run once
OH SHIT A KRABBY
those runs are the worst. sadly, logic in Crystal can sometimes become a coin flip on checks and can influence speed in drastic ways
Pokemon is not necessarily the deepest game Kappa
Can't rrandomize the outcome
But the moves def tried to change
Early Fly helps, but not the way you think
The fletchling clicked fusion flare but it got correct to tackle LUL
couldn't u just start with fly if you wanted too
I found a Sawk
I can't remember. it's been a couple of months (and I have a charity run in a month, so I should probably practice)
You coulda been a deez nuts joke phantom
Phantom do you wanna learn tail slap
@tacoguyy what dat tail do? Kappa
@phantom5800 what dat tail do?
ew I found an electr*de
It's fucking dead and nobody is sad
it attracted a whole new section of the fans
whats the premise of pokepark? Ive never heard of it
that's the best explanation i've ever heard
I just literally loled
Mew is Ultron? propokM
Alright time for the jesse encounter
what will he be
the circumstances of one's birth are seriously completely irrelevant. mew will kill you regardless
Jesse has overgrow and a root fossil
He has the wrong starter ability
double bomb only happens in rando
It has hidden power
I'm not using that
i wish i knew how good watt was when i was a kid
I used sushi when I first played this game mostly
FUCKING BRAVIARY AFTER THE PIPLUP
You're the turtle. You're Blastoise Kappa
JESSE COULDA BEEN AMERICA
50 hp 3 bp when i was a kid i didn't know any better
You haven't gone to 5 since you got Sushie, have you?
now it 10 hp 30bp always
I love that thing
Wait, does the whale open immediately if you enter through the sewers?
i swear if kooper behind the tree
cant you skip kooper in the jap version?
Seed rigged the pred
Now time to beat the game YEP
you wanted to cheat and you already 2 hours in with not alot of cheating
Unlock the ability to cheat 2 hours in and suddenly you can beat the game
There is a wonder guard zizagoon in the fields
I can run from it so I'm good
But i need to kick shit STAT
I think Boo's mansions
Ok the next encounter claimed is a person from the locals
We'll see what will gets to be
I don't mind this but this fucker dying to any ice beam LOL
heading to bed now, gnight yall
OH SHIT MAGIC BOUNCE
no jade raven sounds kinda niiiice. ohhh so you can't do the check LUL
unless you're doing it
Torterra had a magnet so now you have a boosted wild charge
is it that tree thing?
or that something else?
oh that'd be sick, i'd love to see that
WHY THIS TODDLER GOT A LUGIA
Torterra just magic bounced some stealth rocks
It learned fire blast
holy fuck it barely lived
it almost died to a tropius
Heavy weapons guy has present for you
i could tell it went thru due to the follower goal goin up
Yea I have alerts for it to say thank you but it doesn't show a name
Ok I'm out of encounters till after the gym
Mega Banette, Blastoise, Piplup, Torterra, Gible
Gible can punch so I am safe from the zizagoon
Heya man ive gotta start getting ready for work so ill see ya next time!
Gonna be making something cool hopefully
Without p bounce prolly not
There's a mega absol in this grass where mvd was
you got freeze dried and frozen
I have no switch ins for this
I am going to sack jesse
Phantom almost died and then learned payback after I killed the keldeo
i wish shrink stomp was progressive so he got smaller and smaller
Who woulda guessed phantom would be the first to die
MY MIND WAS ON YOU BARELY NOT DYING
Jesse is the dead one tho
That bitch ate the dirt
Jesse had a fossil when I caught him though
So he will be reborn
this elekid has protean
let's gooo Bowser fight!! fifiJiggle
isn't that the optimal gless strat
I mean the booty bop peril
is the clippy one the same spot?
well I gotta head out but have a good night monadoWave
if you use laki on the lava does it let you go oob? that's interesting haha
sNeeders... what fuck am I listening to?
I need my ears to listen to the Hollow Knight OST
this sounds like something that came out of a YTP
the unconfirmed sequel of Hotel Mario on the CDI
But actually I'm gonna get back to work catch ya later hopefully
That's good and early
Does race settings include Big Chests now, or is that still vanilla?
it sounds so much worse
brb I'm going to order some delivery as this chaos goes on in the background
before I do... 2, 3, 3
ohh what an incredible composition
Roman numerals with random digits when?
"XC" could mean 6, 9, or 40
my favorite thing about random pitch is scrolling through a huge list of key items, never fails to make me laugh
this is a cursed sNeed, so make it more cursed
And the text is in another language.
dry dry desert isn't terrible
I think Gourmet Guy is still perfect
Gourmet Guy is torture in the Peach segment
This tune, less so
Yo, they have the second Damage Dodge
just say you "accidentally" left your spoiler log open and deny it on Twitter, to then only say you did cheat 6 months later, where everyone had moved on.
Okay i hate it already
gourmet guy gets fed actual food
Sweet! Now you can access Dry Dry Ruins
Oof, that Last Stand + Damage Dodge
You should randomize your mic too
Bowser heals for days
omg i hate it so much LOL
squeek squeek squok squek squeek
I was debating on using pitch rando, this stream proves I was right in not turning it on lol
I refuse to enable this
This is AWFUL on my ears
I'm super sensitive to off beat music
Also I like to jam out to the games music whilst I play
THIS IS THE BEST UPDATE
Now music shuffle would absolutely be a feature I use regularly
Is it just random bullshit sounds or any shuffling
Yo this shit goes hard
Another feature I'd use would be bootless
People who listen while they go to bed IN SHAMBLES
imagine being like "imma use this as background music"
SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls SkeletonPls
This is the energy the sounds give me
call this the "YTP sNeed"
I'd love to do Bootless, Hammerless start in Goomba Village. I like to really challenge myself. Also shuffle chapter difficulty added on top of that.
That music killed my ears
you'll probably be able to do jumpless, hammerless goomba village start
This is the kind of music that sends you to The Backrooms
@Icebound777 I look forward to it
I really want stuff to get shuffled into the main pool
how is there no peed69 command?
Would it be possible to eventually shuffle chapter 8 difficulty?
kolorado has cost me a repel gel there before
ayoo GL good sir
Yeah, I learned the hard way: always trigger Kolorado before hitting that tree
You missed an oppuntunity to hit Kolorado
I think this game is too big
Should I play pokemon or hitman
Also maybe randomize power-up damage in battle between 2 and 8 or something like that would be cool. Imagine an 8 damage super boots only to get a 3 damage ultra boots XD
Both will have a lot of death
that sounded like screaming, not water blub blub
just wait till the fucking yoshi sound badge
Coconut = Pina Colada
Would it be possible to put boot and hammer power-ups in the main item pool?
not even shrimps would vibe to this
Random tracker-related question (convenient timing): Why are Bubble Berry and Blue Key treated differently? That's been bugging me for a while LUL
Nah, logic is the easy part left
adjusting the big chests is the big hurdle now
Big chest gives you 1 coin LUL
Phantom isn't actually playing a rando seed, he just got this cartridge from an old man at a garage sale
pretty hype for upgrades anywhere
So can Blue Key tho
Yeah I think that would def work
As it stands, Rip is slightly out of place
this sounds like a mario kart 64 song now
You can do the gap jump in the new mushroom gorge
y'know the music is fitting for the chapter because this is a fuzzy drug trip from Yoshi's Island
Anti Guy is painful
Only if you want a real challege
Gotta scrub your inventory clean
ikr??? squeek squeek squeek! it's the best
I preserve my coins until needed
What will Attack FX B sound like tho?
You should progress into Dry Dry Ruins now that you got keys
You got the pipes
''I'm sorry, what the psykitHeck is happening here?
I don't think I could ever subject my chat to this
anything is possible if you're brave enough
I'd lose 50 viewers
And hundreds of followers
Iceblue I think your chat deserves it after what I see them say
Wdym?? What they say???
It's somehow not as bad as I expected but I still don't think I'd play with it myself
it's not about courage
The fact that you have a higher count than last rando baffles me
We're here for the concert
Did you give yourself all the FX badges to start for max meme sounds?
oh my god shiver city
why do you do this to me
Hey Phantom. These sounds are cursed
You're fighting LP for the music right?
free content and comments babee
just don't lose Kappa
I dunno, think we need to hear the game over music
Ok hitman 1 levels were on sale
I have obtained more murder content
throw to final bowsman
brb gonna get some reese's
This place sounds evil
Oh god the record music
sounds kind of like ttyd theme of grodus
can you find laki so this ends quicker
you're getting there PhantoBot
You do in fact not need an emulator to play ch2
Also forgot about hitman filesizes I'm playing pokemon ig
At least icebound is here LOL
this is some creepypasta shit
Now can you repeat the break?
the fuckin egg music
This fucking song SkeletonPls
Y'know what'd be a cool feature? Enemy randomization. Imagine finding Shy Guys in chapter 1. Or Finding Pokeys in Chapter 4
usually picking up an item without control of mario just overlaps and doesn't break
I'm someone who likes to do pure chaos runs, so these ideas are probably very niche.
but this was item pickup + item select at once
gl oh god the pitch rando
just save before you leave
Can rando #69 be an allsanity with this shit on
What do I name this male kirlia I just got
Idk will be great
Moody is such a funny ability
I forgot I caught a silcoon in a cave and named it OOOOOggghh
Every time I get the cutscene without Bow I just go "Oh, Hello!"
OOOOOggghh is a malamar now
tubba can't see green, obviously
Idk is a goomy now
and has no real use for mirrors i guess
it ain't easy being green
now it is a vanillite
wtf is the music randomized?
just do English raph skip Kappa
IT EVOLVED INTO V*lt*rb
Oh no, thunderstorm coming
Phantom took a Moon Stone to the game and it evolved into this mess
But it's mostly any summer day between 5-9 we get something
Holy fuck the name "Idk" is accurate cause this thing is just evolving
lmao Roman numerals. Outstanding.
It won't pick a fucking final stage
Is it lag from the sound being changed?
aw, it doesn't randomize the text of the items' names?
or their icons for that matter
Gotta showcase taking the star stone out
Pls bombette be on the shelf
can you even check the star stone check now?
You can do clubbas jcogSmart
something actually good in that cave
'Gotta showcase taking the star stone out' I'm so sorry
Left mail for the check bombette unlocked
Ok when do we get random pitch as an option for black pit?
don't worry mega bomb is 8fp
use fright jar on final
Is doing that allowed in the races?
but you can laki jump in chapter 6 without water stone
I mean it's second nature now to hit those blocks with super boots so if that's why I ever get 'dq'd' the so be it.
I can't laki jump
Because of my mapping lol
Everything is cstick for my current setup
just no laki jump into ruins
^ because ... why, actually
Cool, we get the pulse stone. Then just skip the cutscene if we have laki.
why would you ban funny jump
laki jump into ruins is totally fair that its banned
tbf many participants in the weeklies don't bother with glitches. not sure why tho
just simply don't play on keyboard
most glitches are easy tho
*Ice writes down notes*
you make that looks so easy
on the gym leader
I rolled speed and evasion after LOL
This glaceon will take on god
this is messed up
excuse me did you just pick up lakilester?
wonderguard Slaking ooooooo aceuhhBuild
I didnt know they made an alien translation for this game
no one will hold anything against you
God the pulse stone sound
yeah go for it lol
okay if you do ruins jump, you have to use slow go for the rest of the run.
Do you wanna hear the rolls I got that fight
Evasion, accuracy, speed, evasion, accuracy
it kept dropping attacking stats lol
the pulse stone is circular but the slot it goes in is a pentagon
it makes no sense
its natural with puberty, the fuse sound gets deeper
why is there only 2 seeds on the tracker
oh its roman numerals
L for 'lots', right?
L is for 50
this music is gonna give me nightmares
Oh god what is the lucario ditto gonna turn into with rando
average friday night funkin song
Cause they want you to mega evolve lucario to fight what is gonna happen with this LOL
I dont like low pitched attack fx c sound
I think goombario doesnt get one but thats because he's goombario
You talkin shit about my hat? kazamsCatglubhat
this is how the prologue song should always sound
Goomba king for the memes?
Ok this lucario fight is randomized LMAO
She got an entei and I got a mewtwo lmaoooo
Does that mean I get this shit
I got mega Y
Yea I got this mewtwo now LOL
Ok so when it megas, it gets moody
Any fucking move I have
Don't wanna be feeling fine for bowser?
I heard feeling fine makes repel gels last an extra turn
I have to go
no more of this
that bullet is in your face
i am no longer able to hear
Youtube gonna go crazy
@TacoGuyy im bench pressing you
that was so bad lmao
Name it Marios new mixtape
make the youtube viewer sign a waiver before letting them watch this
This guy asked me if I wanted a pokemon to surf on and he gave me a spewpa
I wanna hear general guys theme with this
general guy is best boy
world's most adorable war criminal
Yo the spewpa evolved into piplup we can learn was mvd was going to be now
This jolteon is actually good
Time to delete the save file
There might've been that request
Can do the fight/gameover at the same time
it sounds like bones
Yugioh has toon world, paper Mario has tune world.
Blue eyes TUNE dwagon
I'm guessing the sounds are random also?
I gotta do another rando, they've added so much since I last played
Music to my ears
the peach one is terrifying
the pitch randomizer is giving me fight or flight
ch3 sounds like dont starve music wtf
Madge Chapter 3 scam
sounds is amazing Okayge
This is a terrifying rando
okay I'm back after giving my ears a rest, I actually got a headache from this
But what if palace is the star stone check again?
did we do gourmet guy?
I'm back and it still sounds like this. LUL
I see what you did there.
Are those roman numerals under the HP bar?
The text is randomized too?
Scrambled, if you will.
Now all we need are scrambled paths.
Now that will be true rando
yo hold up, actual beats?
this is my doing phantom
you seem cool person
Yay. Watching this cutscene again
What do you mean? It sounds normal to me
I dont hear anything wrong with this?
More of an "exploit"
what a stream to get raided on
Level 7 Ch. 2? Oof
what kind of randomizer is this???
have a lot of fun guys, im heading out
its good on the ears
Is it also in another language or is the text randomized ?
what did i just join into my ears
@tks564_sassy_riku I'm sorry you have to hear this
a new remix of toad town theme
This is the DJ Remix
the help me rando
Paper Mario Randomizer: Pain - The Sound Edition
what does corrupted paper mario sound like on broken speakers?
all escape be safe
phantom listen the fuck up
the real Axl is here now o/
you tell him axl
hope you will never get this rando the sound save us
I go into volcano with only super boots, it give me ultra boots BUT CANT FINISH WITHOUT ULTRA HAMMER
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!?!?
are you only doing one rando today?
2nd rando as a palate cleanser
take a eat break then dp rando :D
you could always stream your cooking...
Leave it on the end screen while you eat
just take a break then stream another one we can wait :D
I already didn't like the Toy Box theme. Now I REALLY don't like the Toy Box theme. LUL
I'm sad... they massacred my boi
this ass be itching mad
phantom has a death wish
for some reason it's kinda catcy
yeah missed typed :3
id rather listen to @know15 play a kazoo
No I know what you meant. I need an explanation. LUL
Axl, you know I'm a musician right? It'll be a lot kazoo.
oh don't know why but it's sound very intresting
Ch. 6 LETS GO!
(and i can't type :3)
"Interesting" is a very strong word. I would say "different"
let's see what flower field gonna sound like
the shyguy's grow up
Flower Fields is gonna be a nightmare.
should've just sat in that room for 10 minutes
it's sound's so dead
General Guy is raising the Shy Guy army of the dead
how we feeling 3 hours in on random pitch? lol
maybe it's the water stone that make it so it won't show you can clear it?
As a viewer? Great.
@RvPA Mind gone, only pain remains
bowser final battle theme
My day job is a theater sound designer, so this is basically my life.
I gotta hear those guitar rifts in broken pitch
I need it at this point
maybe the water stone is the reason why the star don't glow?
I just hit 69K channel points
End of Chapter sounds so defeated. LUL
Good thing the tracker dev is right here
Wait, what does sound like when you Game Over?
Hi, other contributor here!
*Good thing a tracker def is here right now
been playing around with stream layouts
got the track on 2 rows at the bottom
thank you map logic for giving us MarioMan
but have so much space on the left I dont know what to do with F
YEP Early Chapter 6
Oh no. It sounds even worse than I imagined
this is actually the unused vanilla music
I stretch pape to wide screen!!
It was already sad sounding before. Now, it's even worse.
What's the highest cost you've ever done?
i was right :D
was it 6? i looked away
i just said 6 fp and before seeing it haha
It was 6. LUL
i gussed right :D
The higher makes it a little more tolerable but still painful to listen to.
You can hear the game struggling to sound normal
why would you pop off to a bad idea?
Or you could start with random pitch and make an incentive to turn it off. That would get filled in a heartbeat
This is creepypasta music
Where oh where is the palace key?
But, Phantom. It SUPER charges your hammer
If only you could use your hammer twice. Hmmm...
You know, it's not that bad
That sound was... okay
I finished Taco's gift
where could it be?
Imagine Frying Pan being Calculator then being Palace Key
The Power Bounce sound. LUL
in canada milk comes in bags?
what about chocolate milk?
Did you ever end up doing Star Stone check?
I can't get over the End of Chapter theme. That could easily be the Game Over theme. It just sounds so devastating
And there we go
Ch. 7 is in our sights
is the prologue mushroom on the sign randomized
Lanturn Ghost, that fiend
Of course he would have the stone
Power Bounce with weird pitch just hits different
Cheer1000 Need to work on getting Pog Agumon
And there it is
and now we are in go mode
I've seen you do it 3 times so it had to be more than that. LUL
If you're full clearing, don't forget the Chapter 2 tree :)
I didn't know Mario had a throwing animation
I heard a new scheme for picking up girls today
When he threw away items
And Tutankoopa looks like an actual ghost
Or Mummy in this case.
go on facebook market place and look up wedding dresses, YOU CAN EVER PICK YOUR SIZE!!
Chompy sounded... menacing. Which is a good thing
I missed a crash? PogChamp
Are you keeping the crash in the YouTube video?
what happend why you crash?
We finally get to hear Crystal King sounds
Found what, 3 new bugs this seed? LUL
You forgot the golden rule, if he can, he will. LUL
has it ended yet?
what is your crazy idea?
The audience clapping. WutFace
Hey, it's the Calculator
this is where the creepypasta starts
"the game called me a bitch, must be haunted!"
Ah yes, Star Beam the Duplighosts LUL
Guzzled down that soda fast. LUL
With the roll you got, you could've one-turned that with a different partner
PHANTOM I GOT CONEY TO ADD el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
We're almost to my favorite part
I wonder if you could've beat him if you had enough FP.
Peach in the yellow dress?
It only took 1 wish for 10 damage. LUL
We couldn't let this cursed seed be PB
good god this setting is cursed
Ew, that guitar rift is cursed
I hope you find the last metroid
and the nightmare still isn't over
this is some cart tilt shenanigans jfc
would be a shame to run ads over this
I forgot I can also run them
bro i tried random pitch for 5 minutes and i had to make a new seed i couldnt stand it
The one time I've begged for ads. LUL
thanks bot for the timed message
first time i beat paper mario i just left this screen on for an hour and was like "when does it end?"
@OhDeeTV Ah yes, N64 infinite ending screens
And relive that nightmare? I'll pass. LUL
HOLY SHIT ACTUAL MUSIC
Ah, the music I know and love is back. <3
throwing it back to the paper mario menu music
It's not the easiest to get them if you're not familiar with DevTools tbh
Especially since right-click is disabled
I'll never take Paper Mario music for granted.
my ears have been damaged and I don't think I'll be okay after that...
i thought the parade music was pretty good
I'm waiting for the inevitable Tanooki Mario
Or the Cat Mario. LUL
Why so many Volt Shrooms already?
We just got to Koopa Village and we've seen FOUR
Sphere 1 counts LUL
1 FP Power Shock PogChamp
Literally as early as possible
The Seed of Seeds
I'm looking into it, I'll see if I can figure it out
I guess Ch. 3 has a few checks you could try.
Ello phantom and chat
It was... an experience
yeah you just have to look on youtube when it's out
Basically, Paper Mario like you've never heard it before. LUL
you can say that yes
Watched an hour of the all sanity hammerless video when I got home from work this morning
@LTScheff Extreme Rando is fun to watch. LUL
What was removed from the tracker??
Now I see lol
What are we gonna replace the two empty spots with? LUL
I always thought it was weird that blue key wasn't on the tracker but red key was.
Merlow's got quite the treasure trove
Locked behind the storeroom
What did Parakarry do to deserve such a punishment
I figured out the issue with the tracker
Stuck in a tree
Before I tell you, want to guess which change broke it?
It was Blue Berry
I'll be moving that to a new number
I can't believe I joined stream to see you in Flower Fields only 30 minutes in. Ouch
What would be the most optimal seed?
I'll catch up on the cod later and see it go doen
That's some intense hate for Rosie
Rosie has been outed as a con artist I see
The Mole Mission was... unsuccessful
Also, how often have you actually turned in crystal berry in rando? I feel like I never see it
Alright, I just pushed the fix
Lv. 6 Ch. 5? Oof
Getting Ultra Block skip practice?
Just use keyboard 4Head
good, tried the 2 seed settings out
it was very... back and forth
I had the opposite XD
Kooper and Parakarry were in ch7.... 3 hours in
dude, her stuff tonight was 7, 7, and 8
Do Goomba King cause why not?
Still getting all upgrades, just maybe in a different order
Although actually I'm not sure if you can get Ultra Boots chest yet
Also you never marked that you beat 5
did I miss shovel jump?
but I won slots today
that's new to me
you have to now
my megarush was 8 axlsenWut
You are currently in Peril...
so we can laugh at phantom for missing them
@Axl_Sensei At one point in the development of SMRPG, Square wanted to give Mario a sword
in smash he gets the killing edge from fire emblem
Bombette gives you what, 4 checks in fortress?
He needs to be dealt with
Komari says, Agumon's right, it's a lot harder when I did a Pikmin run, should probably setup the new games for MegaMan/Hub to be in that gacha is the g4eatest achievement one can have 4 bowser jr's why don't they just outsource IP's to get new games were as ow as the FIRST STAR OF THE NUDE MOD
Komari says, Agumon's right, it's a lot harder when I did a Pikmin run, should probably setup the new games for MegaMan/Hub to be in that gacha is the g4eatest achievement one can have 4 bowser jr's why don't they just outsource IP's to get new games were as ow as the FIRST STAR OF THE NUDE MOD
Komari always says "FIRST STAR OF THE NUDE MOD"
he done I guess
I'm gonna make the robot lady say that
You can full clear both 3 and 4 I think
I guess not all of 4 bc Bombette
New Ice Cream stage in MK8DX is great
I knew I wasn't going to play enough to justify buying the DLC
there isn't enough stuff added to mario kart for me to pay 25 bucks
I need at least 2 more waves
Hello There! how ya doin?
what if shy guy dropped bombette OoB KEKW
ive got some stuff done finally
Mark Star Stone before you forget
also stopped a robbery like an hour ago
havent i told you?
didn't get vr on ps4 so looking forward to the new one
well basically im Batman
my brother has oculus so I am sold on it
gourmet guy shitting thunder
I don't like randos that have everything open, where the he'll would you start?
I know I have one
The cat is currently at the front door eating bugs that flew in
did tubba have anything good?
Esam really played a wifi tourney today just to stop brett from winning it on his birthday
in the morning I get my first bonus jcogChamp
what do you say when a phantom sneezes?
What about 4th Ruins Key check tho? Kappa
why did they have a token bob omb? nintendo should know better by now
Komari says, it knows I exist it's evolving too fast also the ending killed me LUL
its going ok, im just very tired
i have tomorrow off and still got overtime this week
oh yeah i can't complain
at any of my other jobs i'd have been upset
when are we doing ironmon? Kappa
I asked komari, when's your next stream? you know what I have to do LMFAO
they ordered pizza on election day
so that was cool ig
oh shit, he here!
I have a saying...
well there you go
they say money talks, I say food talks louder
this was my original take on the ruleset that we should allow tricks if you could do something w/o them
in retrospect it wasn't a great take
I enjoy seeing you fail that trick in marathon runs
still waiting on ninja turtle seed
i don't think i even play glitched rando tbh
i think the risk of skipping something if you make a bad decision is interesting
Hey, you can beat 4 now Kappa
yeah that's the other thing
calling it a night
being expected to do frame perfect tricks to be able to finish the seed is a lot lamer than getting an advantage by doing them
As long as it's not clippy, I'd probably be fine with it
are mole fights fixed on rando?
i'm ok with most clippy
I just think it's boring personally
Not my favorite trick compared to others lol
i finally learned the clip for the water puzzle
i'm pretty sure i do the puzzle much faster on average
just bc of muscle memory + block speedup
i'm pretty sure the intention is based on difficulty which is fair
but also very weird because ruins jump was legal
and that trick is really fucking hard unless you have a very specific stick
I think the idea was to allow things that are not too hard AND don't save too much time
i was blind to buzzar skip lol
You're having a weird run, aren't you?
The best Bow color. <3
Where else have you been so far?
spiny surge is already the worst move in the game at 4 fp
That move is just sad
They did laki dirty
Did you check Water Stone?
well he will probably sell you one
Just GP a block in the next room
idk why i assumed you were on all
People are using the fuck outta this thing in coneys chat
I have done my job well
Coney saw the emote and said awww and then he saw the name and said "Fuck you mobile viewers" and added it
Hello darkness my old friend.
None of that was necessary
Hey, you can beat 5 now LUL
Why you bullying Monstar?
Alright, I think it's time for bed, see ya!
I need to play this rando one day because I want inspirations for when I eventually do a bug fables one, but I would need to buy a flashcart cause fuck n64 emulation
Coney tweeted "HUGE NEWS" waited for people to come in, then popped a minute long bounty and ended stream
it's a far long on project
because the reality is as good as I started working on bf modding, I have SO MUCH to do
woah woah, two rando runs in a day? WTFF
like recently, I concluded I needed to redo the docs of like 713 flags we have because the existing ones I did were insuficient
but it's super more random that way
which happens to be needed for a rando because I IMAGINE how they do logic is a depencency tree
Next seed I roll will be allsanity pitch shift goombario hammerless
and I need to know what each flags grants + how you get them
It'll still be better than whatever the fuck buff00n rolled last time
if I want any chance of being able to do that
I also would need to do apis to do stuff like mess with DoAction: a SINGLE function int he game that processes EVERY turns in battles and I mean like every player or enemy action, it's a mess to edit
If I vanish it's because I'm updating drivers
there's also stuff like yes you can technically add or edit text without too much issues, but if you are gonna do it manually, it's painful so I need to make a fucking text editor lol
btw there was a 1.1.2 released like 2-3 weeks ago and I had to diff it...I was so rusty lol
I had to spend 3 hours remaking a script I lost since lol
yeah they fixed 2 VERY VERY bad softlocks, one was a regression that broke an important failsafe that can happen on a lot of cutscenes
Something happened at the mall of america tonight and minneapolis got trending because people don't know where the fucking mall actually is
but they also introduced NEW issues because they added German and Korean....except they did not called a beta
so issues crept up during the diff and I felt sad
ik why they didn't do it and I felt a little disappointed (the tl;dr is it's a QA issue), but it's still mostly a win for people
I like the scripted reload huh
bug fables just has randomnise things (fun fact, this was NOT in 1.0.0 lol)
Ok drivers installed restart time
look I bought jetbrains's IDE SOLELY because I didn't like to use vs on my windows vm to develop avalonia apps lol
also because vscode was starting to annoy me
it's FINE for dev work, but any IDE is better except eclipse or netbeans
and jetbrains is like....the cadilac of IDE, you pay a lot, but your money is worth
I hope your stream is going well
It was GREAT! Thank you
vs is I guess good enough, but no linux
Birthday stream = fun
You've been streaming so much I love to see it
Always happy to support in any way I can
GOD I MISSED THAT SFX
do not ask me why, but the pm64 badge get sfx, the first thing that comes to mind when I hear it is "oh sexy!"
Hows the run doin
Just.. you know, win.
I mean.. we could find the palace key in two.
In before you realize that you turned quizsanity on.
Spell it out with me, Phantom. T-W-O. S-E-V-E-N.
I swear if this is the palace key..
So, we both agreed on seven, right?
bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL
have a good stream!
You have been magnetized to the sewers for the whole seed.
Why is that there?
From over ten thousand years ago.
Is Tast T. immortal? Why'd they seal away her frying pan for that long???
She's too powerful. Returning her pan to her releases the seal holding the great evil within her at bay.
SEE, TOLD YOU IT WAS SEVEN. >_>'
MegaMan.EXE with Mega Rush? That'd be busted w/ Undershirt.
This was a relatively short seed, all things considered.
Do you know off the top of your head what the longest seed for you has been?
I feel like it's around the six or seven hour mark.
Still no Goombario :(
Ralph over here scalping prices.
Dude. Okay. So, I'm into Warhammer 40k stuff. Collecting minis, wargaming, etc. When the Indomitus box came out, a ton of people bought hundreds of it to re-sell on Amazon for like.. three times the actual price. THE NEXT DAY GW released even more boxes of it the second the scam sellers tried to make money that way.
It was the funniest ****.
So, there were just a bunch of scalpers with hundreds of indomitus boxes sitting around. KEKWait
Funny thing is, you only get back in proportion to what you put in.
So, I may lose 2k points, but, they only get a tiny amount of it.
(You better hurry the **** up, Phantom. KEKWait )
Let there be fire.
That is really stupid. haha.
I trust in you.
Heck yeah it is.
Way to go. <3
That shouldn't have worked.
Those hammer steals were clutch.
I better see some goombario
Also I am so happy coney added el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
It's so fucking good
Did you open that or was that just a random thing
I want my points
why do you have 4 seeds?
you started with 4 seeds LUL
did taco give you this seed?
He did this to himself
At least you got your money back
oh you have no hammer!
is this the test seed?
the hammerless test seed in the discord
Hamerless is just out LUL
i didnt know they added hammerless
WE GET THA GOOD CUTSCENE
do mail but with random text KEKW
Did you check partner fp yet
last night i needed only fertile soil for go mode and it was behind empty wallet pepeW
is no hammer start still experimental right now
wtf that block break is huge brain
early koot favor items monkaW
Hey hey. Was in the middle of watching one of your recent run through a on YT, figured I'd watch ya live :) gl!
Axl player from MN I'm homies with made it out of pools on winners at evo
He's cool but he counterpicks leo against me >:(
I beat his ass last time so it's fine
That was before buffs too
I haven't actually gotten to a local since they made my char not ass
kolorado has good taste in books
I think what you should go do is get goombario
early laki randos FeelsAmazingMan
"Logan Barrio is kogaku mario" thank you captions
Alpharad is streaming thas crazy
He got a sleeve tattoo that he didn't design
He just booked an artist for 2 days and told them wing it LOL
oh yeah i found out you can deliver a letter to the dead mayor
it turned out way too good for that terrible decision
ch5 being optional with laki is a really nice design feature
wow he paid 3500 for that tattoo after tip
He just gives 0 fucks about money
And he has no reason to LUL
I would've just won
Alpharad is doing an emerald mod he comm'd
everything is an ice tile
just hold a straight angle 4Head
Simply get through the wall
there will be a video after this works
4 seeds and you 40 mins in?
can you put laki at the bottom wall and up right into it
need to come back with bombette to npc push Kappa
was the blocks ultra hammer blocks?
well now theres video proof
noooo i miss the skip
I even ended it at you saying what the fu-
Ah yes, call a game bad because you lost a speedrun to RNG and yet continue to attempt this. Then you're going to keep calling the game bad and keep attempting the world record. absolute streamer syndrome.

Nice Jade Raven LUL
Wait, is this an early Chapter 6 seed w/ 4 seeds?
For the volcano clip, it looked like you clipped when you got on Laki
Apparently you can LZS to dupe that upgrade
I will do it
Red Jar I mean
normally in my pm randomizers the ultra stone is 99% a trap for me
the map layout you made for dry dry is a life savior btw
everything else i found online has missing checks smh
is the map found on your channel
I'm interested in checking it out myself
where do you go to push founder badges
i can never find it when i look around
ye most of my founders subbed literally once and were never seen again OMEGALUL
i cant believe its taken twitch like 5 years to finally add the option to manage founders
I believe you can get up there by jumping on the chest, not sure how hard it is tho
That Zap Tap was fake btw
he's stuck on the slide
You wouldn't kidnap a kid on a playground, would you? monkaS
If it was goombario?
short extreme rando huh
it's short if you give up soon :)
is that a blue key on your tacker?
*sees it's a trap, marks it anyway*
or I'll curse you with a goombario
Could've been fake Goombario tho
i had a seed with 2 fake goombario 1 time
i pick the 2rd one up thinking it was real and nope
what are they gonna do about it? lock her up
oh that why she was in jail
my store room had a sleepy sheep AND 3 STAR PEICES!!!
Phantom they finally released hugh neutron for nasb are youexcited :)
ripchetoo have the real goombario
As long as you remember where renewable Cake Mix is, you'll be fine
doesn't he have 2 attack power
Wow, you can buy 3 Star Pieces for 3 Star Pieces!
yo 3 star pieces for 3 star pieces
You DO need seven stars to beat his ass
Moles were sphere 0 sooooo
When you don't get spooked but spook yourself
If I had a nickel for every fake Ultra Stone you found in a panel...
I swear every seed with traps have 5 fake ultra stones
I mean, I bet you could buy some pretty cool Star Pieces with that Star Piece...
Boris Post Boris This Boris boris Boris To Boris Post Boris This Boris boris Boris
Did you ever do Shrink Stomp check?
i can only think of 1 thing
Of all the boss checks to skip, Blooper's rough bc it's Sphere 0 when you have hammer
dont u have dizzy stomp
i mean for this blooper unless dizzy doesn't work on this one
IDK how much you watch other rando players, but JCog usually fights Blooper early-ish but save scums it
ahh i knew it
I guess that's fair
my brain starts losing track if i scum
Not too many places it's helpful but I get it
yeah me to beside 1 thing
Blooper's the main one I would do bc it means you hardly ever have to fight Super Blooper
maybe make the 1st blooper late in logic like star pieces
The problem is, as of right now, almost nothing accounts for Mario's strength
Only starting location, dojo and kind of Anti Guy do
shouldn't of said anything lol
he wrote you a beautiful song
Luigi's the master composer?!
i love the random lore bits you can make in randos
He didn't even need to SEE the Lyrics first
Means you might have missed Sushie or a Fortress Key
Or Miracle Water even
sushi could be somewhere monkaHmm
So not a fortress key then...
guess you about to get sushi
Hard read: Bombette's in this chapter
And this is the chapter you were supposed to beat
Go get that real power rush :)
It doesn't have to mean anything but it could
You should pick it up :)
another real ultra stone
You have a letter
So that other one was fake, interesting...
You skipped the last block
Don't you want your friend? :)
i bet with 2 lakis you could skip yakkey
isnt there some tas thing with text boxes for final
red key is always in ch7
dead mayor delivery Pog
Red Key could actually be behind Blue Key
Too fast or just at the wrong times
its my life goal to block the monstar attack someday
It is possible to get that block before fighting Monstar
If you say "Go back" you can do it
I mean, that probably would work as a Snowman hat
random thought: kinda wish that the star spirits could get randomized colors as well as do the NPC's

The emotes failed me LUL
Playing the new Mario Kart DLC
GL and have fun!
I have yet to complete this game
It's nice having the N64 games on switch online because I can take the catalog with me when I'm on the go
Don't get me wrong, it has its shortcomings and for $80/year for a family plan is worth it
With NSO do I need to be on Wi-Fi if I want to play paper mario?
My aunt gets us that every year as a Christmas gift. It's me and like 5-6 other people
twas rough, was playing mario + rabbids kingdom battle
world 3 chapter 4 now
NSO itself could use voice chat on the console but I understand why Nintendo did it the way they did, it's more family oriented and secure that way
it definitely ramps up in difficulty, or i just suck
poor mario, every other fight he gets knocked out
i'd rather have a team of luigi, rabbid luigi, and peach
My first home console was the Wii so it's my first time playing a lot of these games with NSO. It's all included unlike virtual console which is a benefit for me
That's mainly due to licensing
whats a game that everyone wishes would be released on NSO
We got banjo-kazooie on n64 so there's a chance we could get goldeneye
same with Mario RPG. I couldnt beat it my first time playing it through like 15 years ago. I finally beaten it a few years back
Amen to the GC games
It's either gonna be GameCube Or gameboy for the next console added, I can feel it
just in general, i'd like all the metroid games on there
What would be interesting is DS games. How would they go about porting games that use two screens onto one?
Wii U had DS
I would love to play Kirby and the Amazing Mirror again
I've played a lot of games on my Wii U. It's a good console just marketed poorly. And now I miss miiverse
Wii U had an option for all one screen but no touch screen is a potential problem
Star Fox Guard was a pretty awesome game for Wii U if anyone has played it
Plus if you needed two screens you'd have to have a Bluetooth connection of some sort with the dock
I mean it did take them 4 years or so to add Bluetooth audio
So anything could happen
Why is Huff so jiggly?
Imo just use wired headphones, it has a headphone jack which is something you can't say about most new smartphones
I forgot about that
It supports a USB keyboard for its text field
You think the would've updated the standard of Bluetooth connectivity limits
Yeah it was only with the one s and up that have Bluetooth. It's also supported on phones
Do you know when mario galaxy 2 is coming to switch? Haha
What's interesting to me is the thumb sticks of the joycons use graphite for the little stoppers inside from what I've heard
What's weird to me is that they ported SMG2 to Wii U when it was already compatible but didn't put it in 3DAS
I'm curious to see what n64 games will be added in the future. Nintendo reply tweeted themselves a while back saying; 'More N64 games coming soon. Stay tuned.'
All I need is banjo kazooie banjo tooie paper mario sm64
always wanted to play Tooie
I just can't believe rare is still owned by Microsoft for as long as they have been
Rare Limited is a British video game developer and a studio of Xbox Game Studios based in Twycross, Leicestershire. Yeah they're wholly owned
Rare separated well the banjo rare guys but yea rare is owned by Microsoft
They're also British apparently. Didn't know that
I learned of Rare when playing DK64 and Diddy Kong racing
where was kooper? i just got back
Funny story. If I remember correctly, my first experience with a rareware game was Kinect Sports
i really like tooie
the soundtrack to DKC is unmatched in some tracks
Is DK64 on NSO?
do you know the name of the person who made the soundtrack to both BK and DK64?
he's amazing and absolutely brilliant lol
i will go and buy a xbox if a new banjo game come out and not like the nuts and bolts shit
I tried also playing the DK64 randomizer but could not get into it like i do for PM randomizer
@phantom5800 you always stream when I'm at work clintBaka
ive been at work this entire time pepeW
ty for entertainment btw
I just got let off after 10 hours of dog grooming lol
like what does a dk 64 rando even randomized
honestly hardly much is randomized
mfw diddy kong banana is now in donkey kong banana spot
doesn't sounds fun at all
my first world was Gloomy Galleon and I couldnt open both gates to either side. I was almost soft locked lol
i like the resident evil 2 rando
I love ads pugAYAYA
yoshi shop i think
uh i could be wrong
unless it was the rando i have pause on youtube
it also has the first confirmed laki flarrakarry
Do I need an everdrive to play rando?
i use project 64 its awful
I play mine on OpenEmu (I know I have a Mac) and they're okay for me
I don't like emulators tbh I always have controller issues
project 64 have great controller support but the game look awful
I'm off work next Monday clintWeeb
Hot tub stream clintThot
everything on rando no cheating allowed
im still waiting on the hundo rando :tf:
oh and be in a hot tub like jhawk said
never is such a final word tho
you dont know what life will entail Kappa
have a good night
in german we'd call this situation a "difficult birth"
we are a well put together group
i mean, it has to have an impact at some point, right? if you keep lowering you at some point hit 0 seeds
gm and gl ThankEgg
shoot just ended stream before you started RIP raid
sure, it's not a big change, but having something to do in ch6 more often was the goal wasnt it
Ruins jump really should be allowed imo, I was able to do it with D-pad earlier
(realistically how many people will the rules change even affect)
I'll do real testing a bit later
MarioManTAW really?? I have literally never gotten superhammer room w/o parakarry
after like an hour of trying
runback from last week? sushie on pleasant path?
you spoke it into existance lol
seed is not rigged i swear
yo feeling fine tho?
going to play some soccer with the roommates phanto274Hype cyas doggoLeave hope the seed is nice to you
because the race rules are good and consistent, of course
whats all actually banned in the weeklies
glitchless speedruns in general are arbitrary tho
buzzar skip and pie jumps are probably in because a) they have no bearing on logic, and b) because speedrunners know these already
not necessary paper mario
a lot of other games glitchless actually means no major skips
oot glitchless is such a debate lol
ye pape glitchless is pure FeelsStrongMan
i wonder what the oot rando tourney rules are like
link to the past base rules are different. they just allow everything except for the very most broken glitches
yeah, no clipping oob. and besides one or two other caveats thats basically it
This seed is pretty decent.
Merlow's got quite the stash
you couldn't skip it? .... huh
i wish there was a way to make chapter 5 less logic heavy early in runs
I thought you were about to mention the wrong-way Kolorado ride, but that's a new one
so many bugs while im in the middle of getting gear anywhere running aaarhg
45 coins for shroom steak. PogChamp
i gave up on jp parity in regards to map geometry for now
supposedly star rod can dump jp maps, but I couldn't get it to play nice
oh btw is there a way of skipping the bombette puzzle in crystal palace? i know of the kooper puzzle skip, and Im never sure if that works for the bombette one too
oh, that's missing from the parity repo then
Parakarry in a box.
i can dm you the parity repo link tomorrow if youd like to take a look. its not much rn
keep in mind the parity stuff is not strictly planned for rando
has its pro and cons
jp has easier super bloop, and raph skip, but harder hallway etc.
is there anything else relevant then besides raph skip and crystal palace skips
2 enemies on this scaling is rare tbf
Hey which gamepad viewer are you using?
My everdrive is coming soon so Ive been thinking about that
what item did you get in cooking?
just popping in with some good rng. good luck!
yeah, sadly next update will probs only have the post ch4 scene shorter
take the minute of B to plan routing? ig? lol
SNK FANS ARE EATING
ah, the early ch5. a classic
Shooting Stars in shop is pretty good
another reason why ootr is much easier to pick up than pape rando. oot is just plain easy, while pape isnt
it would maybe be comparable if every chapter was locked to, idk, chapter 3 difficulty max
its too bad because if you *do* know the game, this rando is so awesome
If just progressive didn't suck
Which chapter is the hardest when scaled to ch. 7?
i still wonder if the xp cap was necessary. i was overruled when that was discussed
"I made big brained plays in the 1st 10 minutes" flex
i mean, is the cap the only issue?
so weekly randos also for testing settings, is what I'm hearing?
the xp cap of progressive is actually just a lock on the website. the generator doesn't have that
id be grateful for that
the most negative feedback for progressive actually did come from prominent community members
on the discord we rarely got complaints
Lava Piranha Fight PogChamp
i might poke jcog and m4 about progressive w/o cap as well
after swapping from progressive to shuffled i dont want to go back
I just home from vacation phanto274BLANKIES gl gl
dont accidentally hit the mini piranha
cats4eWiggle how are you phantom?
ever heard of stream?
no kitchen set up cats4eSad
Celebrate by doing extreme rando. LUL
hundo rando would be PERFECT for this
@Glennjaamin ever heard of Kanno
There's a 100 rando? PogChamp
he got hacked two days ago
maybe some vanilla pape but a challenge run? there's stuff on the glitz pit discord, like partners only, act only every 2 turns, no items, only upgrade bp etc
what if, you played Spelunky?
cats4eNote thats a lot
you could do dark star
dark star is fun
dark star supposedly is the bomb
Book of Mario is so good
Oh, that sounds fun
so much new content
Dark star would be so good
it runs on ED
runs on erectile dysfunction
yeah, dont have to go all in on dark star, but sticking your nose in cant hurt
dse is a very different thing than mq
absolutely would be some top tier content
sooo many new badges
the new items they add make battles interesting
joe dying a million times to the vulture Kappa
i still need to beat ch5 in dark star
you got to chapter 5?
iirc im at the block before lava piranhna pepeW
this seed is mean it seems
every seed is mean if you are me OMEGALUL
dont jump on a spiky gloomba
You don't have the first attack badge?
now this is what i call a seed of interesting choices
But, it's a start
fr what is this seed wow
I thought you'd be trapped if you missed that key
sadly ill have to rewatch the rest tomorrow. gl on the rest o/
Mario, why are you carrying all these shrooms? Are you under the influence?
Brother Phantom how are you today PogChamp
Tragically vanilla whacka bump LUL
do you lose those letters for the Parrakarry check, or does the game check for 3 different letters?
You got your work cut out
I've not played a XC game, but people constantly blowing up my timeline about XC3 has me curious
I've only watched a bit of 3 and it looks neat plot wise
though I've watched my brother play through XC1
infinite dizzy dials BatChest
Koopas are laughing at you
How could he eat ghosts?
his stomach's lined with..... something that let him eat Boos
Yes, you need to slo down
it's pape speed. no slow
This was meant to be a terrible pun
but can you get Hammer?
Now, you slapthe hell out of Tubba Bubba
Hey phantom! how's the rando?
I see you don't have miss bomb.
what a slap in the face. l0l
pawn off Goombario while you're at Rip's
umm the koopa bros colors are the nonbinary flag
how's the seed going? i napped too long lol
yeah sounds that way. i've been wanting to do the races but with school starting soon i've just been dead on the weekends
how much of 7 have you done?
go mode bombette sounds disgusting lol
have you checked the cloud near huff?
i don't think i've ever had/seen a bombette last partner seed
that i can remember
there's gonna be a lot of mad people lol
hopefully this power rush is at a good BP.
balanced is like +/- 2 right?
a 10% chance for toxicity, got it
rip in peace, koopa bros
ahh i walked away for a sec and missed koopa bros--I wanted to see the fourth color! They were gray, yellow, purple, and what else?
omg thats literally the nonbinary pride flag!
9 doesnt break it jeez
is it the same seed for everyone?
you did good for what you had
you gonna do Laki check?
I went away at Lantern Ghost fight
Tekken 8 got the tiniest ass teaser
They showed kazuya from 1 throw goober off the cliff and then it cut to the new model and it ended lol
What? Did you have Lemon Candy?
They announced a new t7 patch first though lol
You brave and dangerous man!
But yea they ended with the teaser and before it was 2 minutes of world tour and the patch and people were MAD LOLLLL
SNK def had the best announcements so far tho
thank god anti guy doesn't scale lol
Team samurai, Garou, Sam sho rollback
Kim and Shingo are coming to 15 on their own also
Buff00n very excited for the new garou game tho
I have 15 but I like don't have someone to play it with lol
Crossplay in september comes out tho and they're fixing the matchmaking with it
But yea the SF announcement already leaked so that is cool but not crazy
Just wanna see what arcsys has at this point
I wanna see venom but I don't think it's happening
But yea the reveal for t8 got scuffed by how they cut
The comms freaked out, harada came and popped off with them, then it awkwardly just cut to 2015 tekken 7 LOL
It was super abrupt
@TacoGuyy what's the SF announcement?
Juri and someone else got leaked earlier today by their own facebook LOL
They were already in the leaked roster though
I just want them to show Ken
Make the reveal trailer just him fucking white girl wasted in an alley crying
Holding a picture of his wife
Make it the most depressing shit to end a top 8 LOL
sorry they played a multi ad that was very loud whatchu say
I just see a very blessed party lineup
@TacoGuyy S AM E
Mel took the kid, Ryu
She fukken took my son
Go whoop Bowser's ass!
REALLY hope they show off some SF3 characters for 6
where's Makoto, Hugo and Necro
Kof15 is 35% off rn phantom
If I wasn't about to fly to smashcon I'd just buy it for you lol
Honestly I'm more excited for that than smashcon rn
say hi to Taco for me
The gangs all here
I'll get jibca to rant to you about blazblue shit
my neck of the woods lol
if I wasn't broke af, I'd have shown up
GET FUCKED, EGG BOY
Using Bow for the final fight?
How many evo's has daigo top 8'd in lolll
I also love how he like
I use Watt in every fight in Bowser's castle on up.
Won like 5 SF4 evo's in a row and now just says the game was dogshit LOL
if only you had feeling fine you could get peril
Feeling fine is really good in this fight :)
they should make this twink fight more randomized
el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo bowser is fucking dead el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
Wait did he just finish LOL
haha i just looked at the ractime.gg LUL
He was ahead before final
Raid 'em, tell 'em he's TOO SLOW
ggs, that Final Bowser was clutch
i was pissing and shitting that whole final fight gg
such a close race
I was pissing and shitting gg
We raiding m4 or axl
if you're streaming when I get off work, I'll gladly hop in
Ggs yesterday, wild finish
I was v content being 12 minutes behind with perfect? final rng
I think I 3 turned it? I needed fire or 2 non fires and it worked out
some extreme rando this is
Oh hey not looking for kooper this time
take a shot then you can hammer that tree fifiBad
happy anniversary! what did she get you?
laki is doing his best
'ello, happy anniversary! and gl hf! and gg for yesterday lol
what's the pouch the in shop
Shame you can't spiny
yesterday killed my moral, taking a break from rando races
LUL getting blasted left and right
3 looks pretty good now
Was that 3 star pieces for 2?
Didn't realize Mario could haggle
Merlow is new to this whole trading thing
Not my focus atm tho
ill put it on the list
Hammer let's you 'beat' 1?
can kooper hit trees?
happy making pennies from the funny website anniversary
kooper so valuable for jumpless start, can use him to hit save & heart blocks lmao
2 Year Affiliate PogChamp
yeah, it's kind of silly haha
how will jumpless work? theres only 4 chests + prologue bush, but there'll be six upgrades
jumpless will always shuffle boots into regular item pool
So since you can't jump, that means you can access a TON of areas
super hammer room while jumpless with parakarry NotLikeThis
not ultra hammer room
you mean in dry dry ruins
im having safe any% flashbacks
yeah you gotta do what you gotta do but it's still cursed lmao
uhh, ive seen that episode before
another round of divorce papers huh
(ignore that i am running all cards where i am doing 3 card LZS)
lzs is cringe either way
but yeah down is bad especially if the room is laggy
source: i do lzs bhs sometimes
You forgot to mark fortress key on tracker
oh you got it
nope that's much more useful
does electropop work like volt shroom? Ive never actually used one
but yea it's a volt shroom and a cake slapped together basically
15FP restore and the same electrifying as a volt shroom
fire pop is cool cause we use it in peril in glundo which is genius
do you use it to kill yourself...?
no cause you can't die in the overworld
so we use it when we're already at 1hp so it's just an fp restore lol
so its no better than any other fp restore then
no but (a) it's 20 fp and (b) we have to make it anyway for the all recipes requirement of 100%
so instead of selling it may as well use it when it makes sense
oh sheet hundo is all recipes too??
what else you gotta do?
yup, 100% is defined by everything tracked on the chalkboard in mario's house
Ive never heard of the chalk board! im always learning new things about this game
all badges, star pieces, recipes, in addition to all super blocks and boot/hammer upgrades, and all permanent key items
are basically what that refers to
bomb and watt are only things that knock over fast?
so close to TMNT
yesterday was nonbinary pride flag colors
8fp normal laki spiny surge at that
needs larger target Kappa
at least we get the banger music
is it ever worth buying pounces?
so far only good move is 1fp power shell
you have watt, how is it not in logic?
oh! you broke chapter 1
also that's an ooc sentence
totally planned and on purpose
I beat LP with stone cap x2 and just squirt KEKW
you just know the jungle is gonna have the diamond stone or something
The tracker doesnt understand shuffled chests?
oh wait, you made the tracker??
that skips just the one raph check right?
is super hammer blocking pulse stone..?
Leave it to Ch. 5 to save the day
im ready for flarralester FeelsAmazingMan
he did it quizmoPog
surely theres a way Kappa
it's like when you're trying to show your friends how well you trained your dog but your dog doesn't listen.
call it spike skip
cuz youre skipping the spike ball with "spike"
Bombette not almost 3 hours into the seed pog
after that, you deserve 1fp power and mega bomb
Cant lose coins if you don't have any jcogSmart
While I'm not wishing it on you, I do enjoy entertainment
the ice cream truck just drove up to our neighborhood so I got a milkshake
is this clippy again?
did you do panel?
laki is so op
the only cutscene i'd never want to skip
get the silver credit :)
go in that area
that block should break on its own like the ultra block did
lol, money well spent @Rigby235
my favorite key item :)
change pulse stone beeping noise to the attack fx c sound
too close for comfort
Almost had to start over
Goombario did nuthin wrong
mhhhh exquisite dried shrooms tho?
I bet dried shrooms actually taste really good but theyre just bad nutritionally
dude imagine someone comes to your shop, buys a bunch of things, then throws them around before leaving
i mean its their money
how to get banned from that shop:
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes or viewers on viewers. shop (viewers. shop)!
you also literally just got the real one in the shop lol
just make me mod stickshamO
yeah, what about it?
I'll do it again
I think if you banned me it would've been funny
anyways bot was banned
Looks like a vip slot opened up
exploding dirt reminds me of the bomb pie in sponghe bob
so the other goombario was a trap!
"That thing" has a name
now you have to charge until you one turn final out of respect
and you have Goombario for luck
bruh moment during dev testing just now: do full gear shuffle, gear ends up in big chest anyway phanto274Thonk
itd from the first step
you have bump attack?
was that midwest speedfest thing sent in their discord?
Did you see my post about Ruins jump in Discord?
no, we've never done restream for them
I was trying to figure stuff out
nah, on the other one, you can do it from the first step, its what i normally do
is that just a straight up left notch
TLDR: with a straight up-left angle, there's a 2-frame window, going slightly left of up-left gives you 2 extra frames
its jank in the perfect way
is it against the rules to modify your controller to have custom notches?
It is, in fact, not /literally/ impossible
I kinda want to record myself just doing the jump a bunch of times in a row lol
im p sure random is doing that spin jump in RAC
the extreme async had a parakarry start, it was nice
wouldn't it be a great bit to upgrade Goombario?
can you softlock easily with sushi glitch
she gonna give a coin 1000%
worse than a coin
lemon candy for gourmet guy
Gourmet Guy could make you stop having it though
the black and white penguins match this music so well
old timey detective but real
oh god it's the egg
this is chapter 6
yeah looking like 7 is 6, 5 is 7, 3 is 4
I love it when I pick up letters from pedestals and it explodes
Mega Quake has a satisfying visual effect
have you done any dojo?
have you seen scarf and bucket?
What if they're both vanilla?
Did you see the Pulse Stone?
oh right 2 power pluses
Oh look! It's Santa Claus
we killed christmas D:
mm hot leaf juice
yea you wanna clip from the bottom side of that corner
you redid mt rugged lmao
it was in the block up past the cleft
90% sure you have to talk to Merluvlee first
Out of curiosity (and since I missed it), where in Mt. Rugged was the Pulse Stone? Could it have been in logic with Kooper?
The very right coin can be grabbed with Kooper
i bet parakarry is in blooper's chest
Alright so then no
itd be nice if parakarry was your go mode item so you dont have to turn in any letters
did you get bombette checks in ch1 i dont remember when she showed up
theres a few checks in boos mansion still too, right?
pape mod that replaces rowf with Boris
if I had the game
feeling fine was a mistake
that's certainly a title
When they hit you but they actually don't
Quake badges are so good.
It's always funny when a first strike suddenly misses in battle
no parakarryless stanley save :(
can anything even be here??
save the yoshis save the world
is it literally just tubba key and miracle water now?
you can laki clip into there
and out, but it's slow
parakarry avoiding you the same way you avoided Goombario
i'll send you a video of it
yeah it's super free, just gotta know about it
But no Gold Oink?
The clip in may save more time but the clip out prevents a first strike
Also are you /sure/ the Pulse Stone's fake? Hmm
I am so glad I joined in on my favorite chapter but also upset because I still need to finish my 12 hour challenge
YEP Sushie in a badge block
Well have fun, I need to do more 12 hour challenge
whats the 12 hour challenge?
oh yeah im doing glundo this week
let it sink in Kreygasm
also more fun Kappa
i should return to glundo one of these days
i need my sub 7
ye spin dashing just makes running this game so much smoother
if someone gives me the glundo route, ill do it
rigby self harm is not good
rigby if you run glundo i will """race""" you
still hilarious to me i have a marathon pb in the category lol
i butchered something in chapter 2 and it threw off the entire run
i also died in chapter 8 and had to redo door 2
Mario: The Master of Luck
running around for all these checks was rng seeding for the master fights
Mario: The Master Manipulator
another whale ride FeelsAmazingMan
How many whale rides is that now?
just finished drawing Luigi
Always save the Yoshis!
man I actually got disoriented when you said you had the crystal berry because of bug fables lol
been thinking how I'll put my docs on the internals, it's likely going to be a github repos, but I might bonify it with github pages which allows you to do a static website
oh shit idk they put a compass in this game lol
so ant compass or return pipe, it's the same deal where you use an item to get back to the hub
now why is it a shroom? I would get if it was a pipe...
DID TITLE SAY DARK STAR!?!?!?!?!?
i have a file name for u
it effects the game
what is dark star?
it does not change gameplay though
ill tell u when we get to it
didn't this game had a hard mode though?
cause this game is way more balanced than ttyd so you can make it work, but I thought someone did before
yeah that's likely the one I heard
actually I remember hearing mq is bs and mqjr is more fair lol
no idea if it's true
wasn't there a luigi mod that bf took the idea from in a modifier?
cause bf had the RUIGEE modifier and I think it was something like it existed in pm64 with similar concept
@Phantom5800 when u make file for dark star put the name as "antiguy" u can reset after u see it
so you name antiguy in dark star....so they cancel each other and it becomes bright?
im glad you decided to do the hundo rando after all Kappa
btw this song is still my favorite of pm64
gulchy gulch is so goooood
god I did not missed these beeps lol
@Phantom5800 there are a few of them :) "AntiGuy" "AllToads" "ShyGuy" and the last 1... super super super hard master mode i guess... dont do this even if u dare "CantWin"
that was a item
u can get it at start of game if u want
idk if u want me to tell u what it is
but that item was not the "CantWin" code
you should try the "CantWin" code after you beat the game if you beat it
If only we had some water. Man, wouldn't that be a miracle?
How much of the Dojo have you done?
U STOLE THE LAST OF TUBBA'S MONEY
@ilovecats923 And he's about to steal his key too. LUL
want me to tell u what "CantWin" code does?
ok let me type it out
ill type the games instructions
Yee you got it right
"CantWin" file code detected.
oh, you're playing full sanity. :0
You have been given all 128 badges and all 5 unlockable stones. your stats have been raised to Level 27.
Phantom! Happy anniversary! phanto274BLANKIES How goes the rando?
However, battles will always be at 4.5x difficulty or higher. you'll get softlocked, but i dont know exactly where.
I am sensing sarcasm Kappa
send me seed, ill beat it ez Kappa
Problems will occur if you collect more badges or reobtain the stones.
Collecting the greed stone is a bad idea as you might get softlocked.
so the "CantWin" code is super hard
oh shit! I'm sorry phantom. where are my manners. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!
2 year anniversary was like 3 days ago then?
he bought that mailbag for 1 coin LMAO
the 3 codes that dont affect the game in gameplay are "AllToads" "AntiGuy" and "ShyGuy" i say try the codes and then reset
I wasn't here when you got Parakarry, where was he?
they look good lol
u did get snowmans gifts right?
So locked behind a long chain starting with Goomba King fun
any vanilla key items?
did u get the goomba village panel
um streamer, you forgot kooper
Fake Kooper in Chapter 7? More likely than you'd think
what checks did u not do yet
I mean it's not like there are 5 fake Koopers in 7 in vanilla...
the green 1 is the real kooper\
but we have silver credit
did u do koopa koot
the shop letter is fake
did u do merluv autograph check?
get the fake autograph? that is rly watet
help me i regret everything
i got coaxed into a 540 relay
my shift is till 4am pepeW
so i run 3dw at like 2:40
i hate multi mario
yeah with my 2:53 Kappa
did u go to merluv and claim the item that replaces autograph
the only reason I don't like this song as much is cause sad sun is better :|
the mood is stronger
the happy one, I just...forget
Happy Sun is such a mood booster though
happy sun being so rare makes it better for me
Well, since I only play/watch Pape as a rando, I'm honestly more used to hearing happy song LUL
there's so many songs that does it better, but not that many does it better than sad sun
Sad Sun is a bop though
It's very tone heavy
it's kinda like that one song in spm, though that one feels nice to listen to
when you come back to ch7
the panel where u fell and goom save u
Mt. Rugged panel? Hmm
does this rando have a spoiler log?
did you do pokies
the well in 6
that's so appropriate atm too. lmao
tfw waiting for my dad to arrive with my leif plush in the mail
go to merluv for autograph... u forgor
if it is whisper it to me
its behind final master monkaS
@Phantom5800 check merluv autograph u could have forgot to do it
What if Master gives you an Autograph?
calculator into autograph into blue key into cryastal berry into water
attack fx r will help
just download repel gels
well attack fx r will help lots @Phantom5800
yay I got my leif plush :)
maybe a bot can
use attack fx r for luck
buy 69 life shrooms
@Phantom5800 reset game for the shrooms of life
Well, you know what they say, luck is a skill
u can gamble for money @Phantom5800
what luck Badges do you have
u have the silver credit so gamble for life shroom money
why are we doin nothing with partner?
what about taking on enemies
what can it be
is that coin in last shop a placeholder
reset file so u got the other shrooms
u had some before master 3
so reset game so u have it
where did you get the life shroom that you have
just get to go mode or all sprites then quit
which shop was it in
calculator can give another shroom
koopa koot that rat bastard
1 more check in bowser
and sadly fighting is the only way to get coins
what if this seed is generous and gives you 3 life shrroms in the castle?
time to farm amazee daisies
btw leif plush is good, I like the robe, the head is a bit round though and it's impossible to make him stand without support
2/3 the Life Shrooms in the game in Star Haven shop YEP
can you spook them
use the refund badge or moneymoney badge @Phantom5800
but what are the chances of getting life shrooms in the shop or browser's castle
GAMBLE IN SHY GUY TOYBOX THEN
we are in a bad situation
Nah, you got this.
i say just go to dark star
we have feeling lucky itll be fine COPIUM
sorry I use ddg, it doesn't have a I'm feeling lucky button
Only if you care about being fast
what Badges do we need
this seed is cursed
use refund and moneymoney :O
Is D-Down jump good?
attack fx r will give u luck @Phantom5800
maybe we can use the fp plus that you have
Can you level up at all?
but no live shroom
Would 5 more FP get you through final?
in google translate the question for going to castel is "get naked?"
Peach's Castle checks are highly encouraged for once
we need a game plan
Two blues, a purple, and a red. LUL
what do you mean by win
There not even the Yoshi one. :(
wait b is not blue
no yoshi sound Sadge
what item was that
dose the seed randomize defense as well
Find another trap for Peril?
One final trap Bowser set
Nice Dizzy Dial. LUL
@Phantom5800 trap in chapter 7 snowmans gift kooper
Dizzy Dial for the win. Kappa
how much defense dose bowser have
send the seed to rigby
Wait you still have Charge on, can you get Flower Saver?
MARIO WAS SUPOSSED TO PRESS THAT
JUST LIKE THE 2D GAMES
it's time one chance all or nothing
This is for all the marbles
ooo. that could be fun.
like "AllToads" or "AntiGuy" and also "ShyGuy"
i recommend not doing the 5hp challenge
@Phantom5800 dont use them just test them and look lol
do the 3 until goomba village
well do 1 till then at least
there is a skip bowser so just do bowser 1
the toad will give u cake
u did it :)
YES YES YES YES
that was clutch. for sure.
will you do dark star
I'm still loving the fact that cocnut is still a thing. l0l
Live Layout Creation PogChamp
@Phantom5800 for the bowser fight do the code "AllToads" and the cake with "ShyGuy" and "AntiGuy"
STOP MAKING US SMOL
put a dark star behind the big us
game over counter can come in handy
I'm assuming this mod is hard? lol
put a star like this: star GAME OVERS: 0 star
dark star is very casual :tf:
I'm a sucker for a casual play through.
@Phantom5800 there is a small spoiler for the other 2 so i say dont do them
There are codes? PogChamp
the sleeping status is the same as bug fables
think one is easymode?
@tks564_sassy_riku nope that would be a dif code
Peach has taken over
@Phantom5800 the code only makes all sprites toads
Plot Twist: Peach was the tyrant all along
@Phantom5800 u have to do bowser
oh no it's too late everyone has turned to tode
If Nintendo in 2022 made a remake of Paper Mario 64. KEKHeim
watch cutsene after bowser :) then u shall reset
the text is rly just "star rod AND THE DARK STAR"
I got paper mario the origami king a few months ago
8 damage off tops?
you should beat the game like this lol
it's all just toad IT'S ALL JUST TOAD
Even the Star Spirits!?
read the black yoshi dialog when u start ur normal save! in lobby of peach castle
what is the code for easymode?
also chat with luigi @Phantom5800
could make it better for first time :D
@Phantom5800 in lobby of peach castle chat with luigi and the black yoshi
@Phantom5800 dont talk to toad in hallway to skip bowser though bc it diffrent
u almost did a new code
the code was "NewFile"
i dont think ch3 is possible
@Phantom5800 just chat with black yoshi and luigi to check it! u can say no
so what's the difference with this mod compared to vanilla? if it's a lot can you sum it up.
Happy 2 year, double digits!
U MISSED THE THING
THE NEW BOWSER MODEL
He'll see it soon enough.
there is a code for Easymode is EasyMode :3
did u ever play ttyd
well u will know what is coming :)
it has to do with fighting
u can guess by now
if there are super guards i had no clue and im on ch5
I do like how bug fables did it best tho
and a toad fly down in "AllToads"
Perfect guards just got you an extra damage taken off
Superguard broke the game. Once you get good at it, you never have to worry about damage.
Black Mage Kammy. PogChamp
Isn't ttyd 60 frames tho?
all badges bought from mer = badge i belive
u have action commands btw @Phantom5800
with 5hp this prologue took me like 2 hours
forget to save counter : 14
forget to save counter : 1*
make a forgot to save counter
@Phantom5800 u had it
@Phantom5800 u just missed it
If Prologue has a million fans I am one of them. If Prologue has ten fans I am one of them. If Prologue has only one fan, that is me. If Prologue has no fans, that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Prologue, I am against the world.
hello kendarWave gl with pape
game over counter: 1 - - - - - forgot to save counter: 1
I guess they said Jr. Troopa was boring. So they made him interesting.
Prologue is beautiful and perfect
It needed no changes
btw u may want to go to trade some star pieces asap
if i remember correctly there are 3 badges :) for free
you forgot the dolly
dolly was obtained @tks564_sassy_riku
5hp needs every block in prologue 10 hp makes it actually feasible
oh no not goombario :c
can we burn him?
@Phantom5800 may want to read all partner descriptions from now on
tattle does not cost a turn @Phantom5800
they nerfed a lot of items too
out of sight is a good way to nerf it
"I don't like she has to poop anymore" - captions
it cost more fp the more u use it during 1 fight
dont forget to read the partner descriptions when u get them :)
i think my favorite part of this mod is the new items they do add
they actually expand the combat a bit
new items are nice
How dare you die to something you couldn't have known
dont forget to tattle goomba king
wait there was something there?
Trial & Error. You gotta love it
I took a nap -- where was parakarry in the rando? lol
@Benzene31415 WE DOING DARK STAR NOW
prologue scaled to ch8 in this seed
game over counter: 2 - - - - - forgot to save counter: 1
Goombario is here to save you
you should read some tattles though
there was something on the last area phantom
To be fair, Mario also has Multi-hit moves.
what is this place?
that is for later and i wont spoil but map may help u figure it out
Green. Lots and lots of green
yeah look at the map see if it oppdated
@Phantom5800 u can look at map to figure it out! that 1 area but i wont tell if right or wrong
i can tell u if u want me 2
ohhhh I think i figured it out
omg it's dark bowser
the new bowser and kammy
3 year anniversary you complete ch2
BOWSER IS BLUE NOW
I wonder how much damage the Koopa Bros do? KEKHeim
The tagline for the sam sho patch is just "Embrace rollback."
SNK says stop with shitty netcode
go trade some star pieces :)
weirdly enough they buffed hammer throw
3 free badges @Phantom5800
i think its basically power jump now
its equivalent to power smash
they stack also @Phantom5800
@Phantom5800 if u use all 3 curses they do stack :)
berserker is actually kinda based
Merlow's got some stuff
@Phantom5800 a "..." at end means that there is more text
@Phantom5800 this is a boss place where u can do bosses for star pieces! rn u can do goomba king i think... u dont loose items and get after fight
@Phantom5800 the bosses are harder on refight
@Phantom5800 u need to do the refight for the star pieces eventually
It was absurdly visible
that place is easily the worst spot
you should use emulator!
it will make it better for gameplay
but less lag though
I hate using emulator but I don't have an everdrive
u still can prob
N64 emulators especially for pape are ass
idk how but prob a way
Twink saved you from rng
Twink saved you from going slow
Game is hard in both the hardware and in the game itself. LUL
there are places where it will lag lots... even in emulator
unless what i say was not fully updated lol
partners are very diffrent
just pretend its rando
yay not losing starpoint's :D
just saying that you should get some levels
remember to read partner descriptions
back to see reaction
dont forget to read it
It's your favorite part of bug fables
That looks so ass
It doesn't look good
parrakarry is just as bad as you think he'll be
bomb and para is same
WHY WOULD YOU 360 PARAKARRY
same with bombett @Phantom5800 :)
8 directional Koopa shell kicks
I wonder if that's gonna play a part.
wait till you see why 3d abilities are a thing
Twitch has been buggin' for me all day
oh and 1 more thing! u can convert levels into tokens and then the tokens are what u use to change! this is all at the chet ripo? forgor name
I was waiting for you to cheat. LUL
dont do glitches bc u may skip items :)
also hidden block outside next to save block
thats all i can think of! bye
I have a feeling that by the end of this, he's gonna hate this mod. LUL
Also, red enemy bob-ombs
dont forget to tattle also
that is my leaving message
dont forget to tattle
I wonder much damage they do.
oh also tattle new things right away bc some have a thing where u need to do exact damage
bye fr this time lol
Goombario could tell you their health :)
hey, sorry I was on something else, so how brutal is it so far?
so it's I wanna be the star rod edition? :D
good cause his text are just okay in vanilla
I don't run the game, I actually don't really check speedrunning anymore
yeah that's how kooper works
the bot is horny for mercedes what'd buff00n do
I feeled I missed the message entirely lol
loook it's been at least 5 years I played this lol
it's a rhythm game!
It doesnt matter how good you are at speedrunning vanilla/rando, thats not gonna work here LUL
I mean you are technically killing bombette
I have a feeling that you don't like this mod. LUL
I wonder why that is. Kappa
well good luck man
youve seen nothing yet
you cant get away with being underlevelled like that soon
idk how it feels on pm64, but I def was fine with the beemerang in bf...though def do not use the stick because it feels weird
oooo yellow is electricc
I like grinding in this one cause equipping the curse badges give more coins/exp so you can grind smart with some setups
But yeah I dont even know if you can beat ch2 skipping every encounter
they should have made quick change a default ability
especialy if they want you to tattle
did you fought every encounters coming to here? I wasn't here
ok yeah it's def a curve issue
If I recall correctly it doesn't take a turn, but you do have to have him out.
it should not have a undercurve like this
like this is bf MOREFARM bs lol
I dont think theres a good grind setup in ch1
Hey, looks! It's Sushie!
buying pow blocks would be your quickest way out tbh
yes leave the whole dungeon to beat the dungeon
We will not give you the tools inside your objective you must get them
just got out of work
WORK WAS A FUCK
for those who haven't played bf here: both normal and hard mode dooesn't have a curve issue like this: you just fight naturally and the curves line up
so this is why this shouldn't happen
That was exactly what Color Splash's problem was.
Well the whole point of challenge mods is that the game is challenging even using everything at your disposal, its not supposed to be a quick run
Yea I only played bug fables on hard mode and I never felt like I had to leave to get shit unless I just forgot to grab things
cs tbh I would go over other issues first, but that's another topic
I felt like the game gave me what I needed as I went naturally
even on HARDEST you don't need to grind, you ONLY need to grind in bf in MOREFARM and....okay MAYBE RUIGEE, but I feel this one doesn't feel like a grind at all
I think the worst grind I had was the start of EB, but I felt this one was bearable
That's how good fire emblem hard modes are
you most likely end up grinding in the cave a little
after that, it's fine
FE10 endgame was fucking brutal but I genuinely had the tools to beat it blind the first time I just had to strategize
FE10 gave you a billion dollars at the start of endgame and said "You better fucking gear up"
I think each one had a unique property but you'd have to have higher stats to see them without dying.
Now if they did like 6 or 7 HP, and they're damage input was weaker, that would be a little better.
oh damn i thought you were on rando still
i lied to my trusting viewers
@mx_four We can never trust you again
Thing is, if it was easier than than, you'd be able to cheese any fight with a little item preparation and a couple extra levels. So for it to be a real challenge, it has to assume you're gonna go the long way and it will STILL be hard
you are rewarded of finishing a bad rando seed by.....doing an even worse thing lol
I loved it but its the kind of thing I'd do once a year
I was drained after, took me 50+ hours to get through it all with the extra content
time to learn how to use star power
time to learn how to grind with stars!
imagine if this were a secret dark star boss fight
I think this tutorial has an interesting reaction if you equip berserker before starting it
the canons is a fast paced rhythm game
master quest is worse on the grinding aspect and unfairness tbh
i believe it, the mq vibes was just cause of the rooftops
dse is easier than mq until ch7 where it catcher up, but then it has extra content that goes beyond crazy
I think I understand now why bf put a freaking timeout on the direction
when i got to that room was the first time i thought about quitting it
so how bf works is if you wait too long, it will snap to left/right so you don't end up with this issue much
what's going on here
Paratroopa's have less HP than regular koopas. WutFace
ok that part i like
gotta go, 'have fun' LUL
so this has spy specs, but useful!
They heal while they're asleep? LUL
this is also bf lol
when was this made?
ok so they could have taken from bf
is this mod designed to be not fun
25 hp 2 def incoming
this is....very random enemy placements
A Gulpit? This early?
good on him getting his own lucky star
What's the fire flower symbol for?
omg jr learned action commands
ik I was joking, but this is really I wanna be the star rod
Jr. Troopa had some tools
well they got rid of the op effect so that's good ig
close call is just powerful enough in speedruns to be reasonably used
but not good enough to be a good strategy
did they pulled a bf and has a feature to buy recipes?
the only category it's good in is no pw lmao
Anything with a ' in the description means there's more information in the pause screen's item menu
one day, a mod will remove the stop lag on the spin so you won't need to jump
I believe the double mushroom you can use twice at 5HP each. Saves an item slot I think.
omg what is this?
if i had wings to prevent mario from jumping on me
you bet your tush im using them
so one problem with tattles is it's not like bf where everyone can tattle so you deal with shit like this
i keep reading bf as boyfriend
the funny thing is spy specs in bf is useless cause either you can tattle + run OR you are in a boss and in that case it doesn't matter because you still have the tattle on retry
@mx_four I have the opposite issue :(
6 quick damage is all
Whacka got tired of you dealing damage to him all these years.
yeah this mod is...bad
Maybe a sound cue
like you could have warned with a snarky dialogue or something but noooooooooooooo
He's no buzzard though. LUL
kooper operates on 8 axes now?
see bf would have reset the thing because of the switch
seems like its more than 8
bf is 360 degrees so still not as good :(
I am joking, it's better to dpad the beemerang
you WILL encounter this fight
Bruh, the enemy placement.
just gotta walk back to the heart block between every fight (:
Dark Star? More like Crumpled Paper
this is basically pokemon kaizo at this point
i've always heard rough things about this mod
Challenge is fine, provided it's fun and enjoyable. Challenge that's intentionally dickish cuz "you gotta prove ur a real GAMER by playing through all these intentional bullshit design choices"
it's what I wanna be the games does
which is why I made the joke earlier
if you tried reed's hard mode beta for ttyd, that was a solid approach to a "harder" version of the game
ok this feels weird and fly in bf on a stick feels better than this
yeah hero mode, whatever the name forthat same thing is
I bet they nerfed Quake Hammer
I still am impressed someone even TRIES to make ttyd hard and not go insane because it's hard to make it hard with how unbalanced it is
reed had the first... bit more than a chapter done and it was really good
there's not much to nerf lmao
did you save before buzzard?
ok, i accidentally refreshed so i ate 30s of ads
WOW I DID NOT SAW THIS COMING, OH M GEE!
You can't fool this buzzar
i think 35 or 40
And it hits the partner
you kinda gotta pray for that mash move
tbh even HARDEST in bf is not close to the bs in there casue hardest in bf is brutal, yeah, but it's not bs
oh success is just 0 damage? that's nice i guess
Hell, even FE gives you stronger units for harder difficulties
this is just CBT
the most bs hardest got was b33 and even then...moderately and mostly if you have a bad set on mystery
lol an impossible mash, the best kind of mash
SUCH A GREAT MOD
why does wind do an extra damage every time? it said 1 and did 2
you can block the moment you hit the ground
somehow i beat this on 5hp
@audioblood cuz it's HARD
i think it was like 40 tries tho
Well, I guess if you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right mod.
FOR REAL PAPE GAMERS
we still don't know the hp lol
WHY DOES THAT DIZZY
lmao the sunshine runner killed the thing lfggggggggg i can sleep on time
At least you don't miss your turn like in the original
But you just have a chance to miss
ggez first try, no resources used
but other than that, nothing
I think if you're dizzy you always miss attacks
wait you WANT to explore it?
I would be scared
What's the 6x fire flower
I could be mistaken but my recollection is it's always in this mod.
why does this sound like an orgasm?
it's a mechanical sound :)
the letter see is half an O
is the oasis a trap?
how does a peach make this sound? you peel it VERY heard?
given this mod, you have 75% to regret it
But how much damage though.
vanilla is the finest of the flavors
oh hey it's one of those sandfalls you see regularly in nature
just use the stairs 4Head
look I do think the bf desert has its naviguation issue but wtf is this?
the desert drains your fp because fuck you, yes that is correct
wait did it really say that
hey i censored it
did you guys know twitch censors your password if you type it in chat?
We made it to the outpost
see i typed mine and you guys only see ****
no, but ik of a phrase to ALWAYS trigger automod
oh hey i gotta try that
dried shroom and hammer an extra 30 coins just because
dried fruit for sale??? why can't that be vanilla :(
do you have automod enabled? I can share if you don't it's stupid
Dried Fruit in shop is pretty pog
ok all you need to do is say "shit fucking" in a sentence in that order
I am not joking
ive told automod that 'waifu' isn't an offensive term 100 times
well why would you want to go shit fucking? that's a terrible hobby
omg they didn't fake the answers!
lack of game knowledge smh my head
goomba king is a true patriot
no thats what quizmo says
do you want to do all the 64 ones?
i wanna say 7
i can only think of 5
nah definitely more than 5
there's 3 top 4 bottom
there's only one that ever matters
lol my initial reaction was "oh cool, vanilla pulse stone"
oh i forgot about the one in the top left
id get a wizard spell
are you beating this tonight? can i stay up until like 6am to suffer with you?
So vanilla Power Bomb
nvm it does beep
and now that you skipped so many encounters, the game will hate you even more!
this whole place is gonna suck
how can that ever be worth it then?
Yeah, Power Bounce is useless
multi hits is something I will need to think very hard when I do a bf balance mod because it has the same issue
lmao the tomb drains even more
get absolutely dunked on
its 2FP per 3 turns haha
that being said, that way was terrible lol
like bf has this problem where htoss and ttoss badly needs a nerf, but it's hard to make them RIGHT
3/4 power on consecutive bounces and 4cap on bosses would probably be fine if it cost 2-3fp
that being said, 3/4 is so dumb lol
6 for that garbage is so disgusting
yeah that's the issue, don't touch the fp if you nerf the output this much
why does a single player game wheer the balance to that degree only matters for crazy optimized stuff anyways
ideally you nerf both A LITTLE BIT
Ok so my pokemon X rando didn't *die* but only my starter and like a baby are alive rn so I'm just gonna reset lol
power bounce is deadass not even that busted in vanilla without a lot of synergies
like why did they do this
it's p bad tbh
yeah if you don't go nuts with +atk then what does power bounce even do
like no matter how you slice it, you need a nerf too have scaling
you don't need THIS MUCH though
when are we getting a paper mario online battle system like showdown
Feeling fine would be good for this :)
Poison bats + FP drain
is it like bf where poison can't be lethal? lol
1v1 me in paper mario
so 2FP every 3 turns isn't even -2 on turn 3, its just a bunch of -1s
cause it can't in bf
if poison couldn't be lethal final bowser would be so acceptable
oh you unequipped it
the funny thing is it was kind of an accident: the problem is if they implemented letahl poison, it would fuck with the battle system
too complicated to explain, it would not handle this change well
for those that were off doing stupid stuff, whats dark star?
*im the one off doing stupid stuff
dark star is suffering
M4 do you wanna be my starter for this next rando nuzlocke
you know i do
I had a mega banette last time
The Koopa Bros were kinda jacked
You'll top it for sure tho
there's also end game content i guess but it takes a grind to get there
who's gonna take the time to rebalance the whole game but leave this damn room alone
Is master quest after this?
The Green Koopa was immune to POW block
The mod says it's as difficult as Master Quest Jr. Actual Master Quest is way worse than this.
bless not vanilla slow go again
tbh this one is fitting lol
that heart block is hella ominous
oh and the heart block recovers star power!
Honestly, why would Dry Bones NOT be in the ruins
expect to take 7 damage
so.. what do you do if you didn't upgrade bombette?
....man this is really let's take bf, but add bs
lmao get absolutely baited
@mx_four on the nose
cause there are so many stuff from bf, but implemented terribly
they were nice in bf though because the first enemies that did it, if you were quick enough, you could avoid it and they prime you for them and it's only on hard, this mod is like "FIRST TIME YOU SEE THIS GUY, FAKE!"
They programmed that in the game just for fun, didn't they?
as ttyd proudly said when selecting hp "pick this if you lack confidence"
The filename for my rando rom will be M4sBigAdventure
Oh, I know what you're talking about
Let's hope they don't die immediately LOL
If M4 dies tho I'm bringing them back as a ghost type every single time I get one
its like catching a pokemon
Hey so I might not normally mention this but since this mod's surprises seem to be agitating you, you might check the detailed Life Shroom description.
thank god, airlift was so op
Air Lift isn't even that good. LUL
hey do you think they disabled air lift for hallway bowser because if parakarry dropped him out of orbit he'd die and the final fight would be skipped? it'd be so fast. also, would buzzar eat him?
What didn't they nerf
So one Life Shroom at a time
why did this NEEDED a nerf?
That is so indescribably ass lol
well life shrooms were giga powerful, they kinda did need a lil nerf
if 2 trigger do you get 20 hp back?
like I think the person who made this had the wrong assumptions on this game inbalance
Honestly, they needed the nerf. LUL
what do we think, 50 hp? 60?
ch7 scaled ch2 i see
this seems worringly tame
its 40, you did 10 turn 1
Well, at least we know.
up by -1 actually
Each partner gets a new mechanic when you upgrade them
He still hits himself! PogChamp
why doesn't he open with that
tutankoopa is not very tactically minded
Your max HP goes down to half
I mean desperation attacks are a pretty widespread video game trope =P
you should've checked it's defense
sky dive regaining fp is weird
1 FP for Sky Dive though
yes, i could see it
just hit it once for 10
that was just vanilla
i think it's just alluding to the cutscene post battle
I am curious how much bf elements the guy put in, but didn't double checked WHY they were in
They do want you to tattle but only sometimes are things different.
i see you have smash charge
too bad the chomp has fucking 7 lol
Cheer22 (11x2) for the 2 yr anniversary
in master quest i did smash charge + quake hammer to clear this but the chomp is way too thick
You could take off FP plus since you drain FP so fast anyway
Quake Hammer + Smash Charge?
I'm your mom now @mx_four
can you air lift the chomp?
@Axl_Sensei thanks for the gift sub
Axl with the 5 gifted subs!? PogChamp
killing the chomp does absolutely murk his dpt though
If you haven't already done so, click the pape button! Every prologue reset is greatly appreciated! There are no good rng, so if you want to just cry, there's a need to play Pape
Egg coming in clutch
That defense de-buff really hurts
how many fp is smash charge?
it may be worth it
him casting the spell every turn and permanently knocking partner out is rough
why did they nerf fucking smash charge
its the same turns and its just less FP
charge charge charge quake
fuck if i know
Smash Charge + Quake Hammer unfortunately might be the play.
I think the charge badges have a strict limit on how much you can charge.
replace refund for danger saver
need to get some sleep, thanks for the stream
it takes 4 turns to kill chomp with smash charge, that's way too slow
Later, Axl. Have a good one
We need one attack item and a couple of FP items.
quake hammer + pow block + fire flower kills chomp
even the stone chomps are immune to fire and ice
oh of course it is
it looks like it teleports, yes
yeah rinse and repeat
if he's really at 11 hp this could be it
The ruins takes so much FP over time
does a pow block knock him off?
i like how he got 3 turns
you have danger thingy
you can charge and quake
and you can refresh
Does Tasty Tonic eliminate the de-buff?
fire flower + sky dive kills?
oh he was 3 lower
nerfed smash charge mvp
Smash Charge + Quake Hammer FTW
They nerfed them and it still worked as planned
ready to gameover in a peach cutscene somehow?
So for Bowser's dialog just replace every instance of 'Star Rod' and add 'and the Dark Star'. That's the only change really.
i wonder what final bowser is gonna be like
he's getting his reps in
Gold Koopatrols be zoomin
instead of life shroom
Why is that Jammin Jelly a different color?
dont get hit got it
dont forget to check right 1 up 1
buttstomp turns into power bounce and if you don't block you lose all your commands
the spooky new room
splash it on your enemies
Shortcut to Ch. 3?
someone give mario a polearm
shortcut from chapter 3
Did Group Focus get buffed though?
its probably for when you have to comeback to desert shop to buy items to bribe the boos
it better have deep focus apply to it
good thing this wasn't changed
wouldn't wanna ruin the game
OOOO OOOO OOOO OOOO
what if its more than 100
it's actually 1,000 and you just gaslight yourself into "was it 100 yet? it must have been?"
it's 20 and then 10? or 10 and then 10
yeah, 0% you use that before final
how much does it sell for>
yes kill whacka imo
It sells for 99 coins.
I thought maybe the bu-bulb would be a fight
you have a golden shroom ?
100% chance he is immune to dizzy shell
kooper supposedly got a passive buff of some kind for upgrading him
Oh status effects are nerfed in this. I think if a status works, it only works like once per battle.
if you could get that block, this fight would be free
-1 defense? kooper poppin off
Kooper has a de-buff? PogChamp
does that -1 stack, or?
WHY THE BOT SAYS SHIT
you have to use kooper first
Buff00n is an idiot
-1 year of his life? or ?
whacka probably has 0 defense
so it isn't doing anything
his bump better be delicious
So if you do it again it gets harder
@tacoguyy FUCK OUTTA HERE
your mistake was decreasing his defense by 1 instead of increasing his defense by -1
FUCKIN FORGIVE ME FOR NOT KNOWING
i just looked it up, it lasts one turn
doesnt say its harder to do again
bye golden shroom, see you in like 5 chapters
I wanted to see how much it sold for. LUL
Sorry I meant hitting whacka
anyone else excited for post ch3 jr?
so outta sight is... 10 fp?
I bet The Master is like Super Saiyan 3 at this point.
Maybe even Super Saiyan God Blue
Citra stopped working and idk why
I've clocked back versions too it just won't load my roms anymore
No adventure for m4 linkusCry
my heart is broken and my day is ruined
now that would be an appropriate spot for vanilla power bounce
This mod is so unforgiving.
the boos fight you ??
This game makes you second guess yourself three times.
Strange leaf has extra text I think
Invisible ghost. Go figure
does fright jar work on boos? haha
they have over 6 hp? why?
can you boo the boos
at least their attack animation isn't super long
Death by getting spooked
It's not divided by
yeah so like if you're in peril you'll have 14 hp
if you have 7 hp you'll be at 8
It just means HP and FP respectively
Wait how do you have seeds already
new hp = max hp - current hp
that is pretty strange though to be fair
i was about to be like "lets divide by zero and see what happens!"
@mx_four It is called the strange leaf. LUL
i didn't notice that
We have a chance
Wow I'm amazed it worked on one of them
i mean, thematically it makes sense that boos wouldnt be very susceptible to fight
i bet they're like 30% to dizzy shell
the visible one didn't go invis turn 2
that's good to know
you have to survive the first 4 attacks (:
Power bombs hits half of them anyway. LUL
the 2 boos dying on turn 1 is natural selection at its finest
Admittedly, the jump scare being a fight is cool, but
Dark Star's still dickish
getting a level out of this is nice
just to see how awful he is
jr unlcoks after super boots
did the pushes even work
he looks pretty far right
it seems like they bareeeeely worked if they did
you are hammering way too early
Did they patch it?
yeah you're trying to push before bombette even lands
the frame you can push is when she touches mario's hat
this is definitely faster than the record minigame
you're gonna be proven right when all 9 of them attack you
too busy nerfing smash charge
yeah we all know how that badge was way too strong in vanilla
What's the point of that if they nerfed them anyway
is that a life shroom cake?
when your fp goes to zero it auto procs?
Shroom Cakes have a very different effect in this game
the "..." is spooky
YOU CAN'T HAVE SHIT IN DARK STAR
that was my nickname in high school
it's literally just worse Repel Gel
that tasty tonic coulda come in handy after all
double dip boo leaf tasty tonic
Nerfed Repel Gel. LUL
if dizzy is 100% chance to miss too, that's quite the item
tbh it might be good on this exact boss
Dizzy isn't 100% miss I don't think. That would just be ridiculous.
and then using another item on your dizzy turn
go fight jr imo
i just wanna see what his stats are like
Next will be omnidirectional Watt.
you have to aim watt at the hidden block
didnt expect that second hit lol
Nice 5 damage though
can't wait until he hits parakarry with that too
at this poitn i think power jump is better
wow actual 0 resources
No trouble at all
oh man what's gonna be mega rush
probably a fight with 4 tubba blubbas
and the reward is a mega rush that only gives you +3
Are they gonna nerf Mega Rush?
mega rush is maybe the best badge in the game, gotta be nerfed
for all the times you've said "man i'm in ch3, but i really wish i could immediately get to ch2"
every fight is 22 enemies
Was that a Red Boo?
the strange leaf is acrually op i think
Late game Strange Leaf sounds OP actually
Guarding the treasure chest.
I mean even now, it can potentially restore ~18 hp and ~15 fp in one turn
watch, it'll game over you
if you had it during tutankoopa it woulda really helped
is this better than Spook?
spook instantly wins fights
this does nothing unless the enemies are very thicc
@mx_four tell us how you feel about spook
it's not bad but it's not good either.
but def instead of atk
how i feel about spook huh?
i don't think the world is ready yet
Honestly, if you're gonna reduce defense, you might as well buff offense.
itll be good for the inevitable albino dino fight in chp 7
Please don't be nerfed D-Down
So there's no point.
it's goo dlike 3 times in the entire gmae
p hyped for mega rush
is the fuzzy supposed to be a bed bug, or something
Dark Star wants you to suffer
watch, Tubba's an actual fight
bro he is FAST
oh shit! ive NEVER seen that
didn't know about this interaction
THIS [EXPLETIVE] CAME INTO THE DOOR
Bristles are here too!?
WHY'S THAT THING HERE
also jumping on spikes did three damage lmao
What is going on? LUL
omni-directional Parakarry would get you killed
Still to this day, tubbas chase theme is a banger.
honestly thought they'd make him chase you faster
they keep story events vanilla, but make everything related to enemies dickish
"farm levels" aka grind
26 sp is a lot
Time to grind, I guess. phanto274Shrug
50 hp, doesn't run at 5, hits through invis
Let's see how bad this fight is
Okay, that's not too bad
6 is a lot of fucking regen what
smack for 5, do 0 damage, nice
time for charge strats
i think he does
you can charge on dizzy turns probably
Yeah I looked into it and you do miss 100% when dizzy
He might regen forever
i low key wanna see how hard it smacks you with the special move
why are all your fp costs +3 or something?
Why are the numbers highlighted?
i thought it said you'd only have higher cost while the debuffs were on
I suspect he does regen forever. You're expected to somehow do more than 6HP of damage each turn.
I take back everything I said
what are super curse and ultra curse?
Smash Charge + Hammer Throw
the triple and some grinding with bombette seems great
stack them? casual 9x damage?
Is it Grind Time?
yeah enemies do 9x damage
90 hp , glhf
wait, did they get auto tattled?
thats the game's solution to grinding
It's Grind Time baby~
you can 1.5x the 2,x and those guys still die to mega bomb
The curses act like peekaboo
mistakes have been made
100% getting one shot
Well, it does triple the damage
does the goomba have 27 hp to start?
Boo Leaf is about to come in clutch right now
would he smack into other enemies if they existed?
Body slam now has a spin smash effect.
see if charge works with boo leaf
Yes. Grind Time baby
Well, at least we know where to go to get more Boo Leaves. Kappa
Around the World Body Slam?
you could even do two of those badges
3 damage off the Spike enemy.
perfect opportunity to use curse, wasted
smash charge hammer throw
You know it's a good thing Tubba doesn't show up if you take too long getting to the heart.
you need to do 7 damage on like 20 consecutive turns
Smash Charge + Hammer Throw + Boo Leaf
10 damage is only 4 damage. for 4 turns worth of effort
Max damage is 10
If only you could put him to sleep. Kappa
Berserker is unpredictable though
take off any badge attacks you dont want berzerker mario to use
Don't need power jump in that case
Oh yeah, and you can't run from fights
oh shit you cant run with berzerker
a long, slow death
At least you saved
and does berzerker fail action commands?
the hammer was doin 4, but jump was only doing 1
The action commands are harder
You have to still time it
I think maybe you can do the action commands yourself.
like the hammer thing didnt show up
Damage Saver might be good.
danger saver cant hurt
well at least he cant one shot you now
I return with salad
this is the play for sure
he only has 30 max, no 40
He starts at 30
wait what? he gets to do both??
Attacks and charged for his next attack. Oof
you can put him below 5 by attacking
wait is tubba gonna be a real fight?
Now for the Tubba Blubba Fight
Probably take off berserker for the goombas
put power jump back on, take berserker off?
Nevermind you got it
why does he have 50 hp
is this a prank
and he hits for 8 blocked
at least the first fight is free
2 hits, the third kills you
take off berzerker after heart i think
Are Berserker strats gonna work on Tubba Blubba?
Then just smack with Bow
on turn 6 bow won't get a turn
if he does exactly the 3 8-damage attacks you win with 25 hp
but if he tosses you die
One more level up grind.
if he tosses 3x you die but oh well
as we usually say in pape "just need 30 hp and i can beat ch3"
It's up to RNG at that point
no it plays around it twice
it plays around unblockable twice AND missing the block on the smash
Did you get the life shroom
1 damage shy of killing him that turn :(
Last time you didn't have Bow out so you should win faster this time
omg, you're still on this?
I expected a dnf
already beat jr and everything
are you gonna continue this later?
i absolutely wanna see the conclusion of this
just for the horror that is 40 damage, 250 hp final
This was fun. I want to see you keep going.
watching suffering is always fun
No offense to rando, I'd rather this than rando
we did not include hammer math
I think it's interesting to watch, but if you aren't having fun it's probably not worth it. There is a ton of new content in the very late game though.
That's what I was afraid of.
31 done, 19 left
Yes, Mario. Keep jumping.
hes doing less danage than we calculated
so I think were good
even if we kinda forgot hammer was a thing
Berserker is a little RNG based but it's strong.
bow's curse will be helpful!
ruff gonna heal himself like 3 hp per puff
oh no, this could be real cursed
its gonna be like "anti guy, anti guy, or anti guy"
Meanwhile, Dark Bowser and Dark Mage Kammy are having a fight
they're gonna see right through your lies and give you enemies anyways
We'll see if it's truly vanilla
But was it ACTUALLY vanilla?????
It could say one thing and mean another
We'll find out, NEXT TIME
@ScrambledDragons you know what freud's version of this is?
good stream, happy anneversary!
NEXT TIME ON Paper Mario Z
@AudioBlood No. What is that?
he says one thing and fucks your mother
iceblue was in my recommended channels

Hai hai. : D
Here at the very start. Nice.
clintR -.7 second on chest opening
Still a bunch of Yoshi checks either way.

the life shroom u needed for last seed to make it easier
This man mugged the mansion.
Could have looted the sewer a bit?
Experimental? What's the differance between your usual ones?
Just saw your hot take on twilight princess, I'd have to agree lol. Last good Zelda game clintB
loading zone randomizer when
also what was in the para spot
With my bad luck it would probably be 8 BP for power bounce.
well it should be paired with star randomizer
u will prob get watt soon
Truly a money seed.
I blame joe stockChadBiden
did u do bulb
oh boy what is this
is this a farm coin seed '_'
send this to rigby
is this just a bad start or is there something different about this seed
and u needed both
bc train and seed
get bow now and u get to farm coins lol
send this seed to rigby :)
what item was it
rigby will like this seed
u missed item block :(
the bot did warn you
who type through bot
bye cocnut for good rng
did u get the lyrics item
u have 1 tubba key
did you get the mailbag

why is parakarry not in logic?

Have you been to 5 and 7?
can u give me link to ur tracker? ill mark down the checks you do
snowmans gift after bomb

Yo Mama so stupid... ...she was yelling into the mailbox. When I asked her what she was doing she said she was sending a voice-mail.
get 3 cocnut and replace all items in chapter 7 with them
@ilovecats923 thats what she said
get coins from lava spinners
we fight LP on sundays.
why did u not fright jar the 4 of them
train and seed time
dont forget that bubble and lemon are in 7 shop
i think i used the bubble berry on sunday
i opted to not go into the ruins with 1 key. mistake.
how many times has goompa hid the dolly from goombaria
cocnut where star piece is and on sign
run around the red tree
the red vase code?
@Phantom5800 running around red tree tells u to ground pound 3 times in house with spinning roof
u can do antiguy now
lemon in chapter 7 shop and idk where cake mix is but u know it somewhere
cake mix was in boo shop
lemon candy is quicker
yeah Phantom, make love not war
give rigby this seed :)
nah that was star piece #38 instead of star piece #21
ironic that whacka gave you a hammer
Watt just hanging out in a bush
was it not worth picking up the letter for a check later?
did you add calc to your tracker?
u need dirt, water, star stone, lunar stone, and blue key (or was it red)! OH AND ALSO GOOMBARIO
did u need red or blue key... i always forget
items needed: dirt, water, lunar stone, and blue key (or was it red)! OH AND ALSO GOOMBARIO
moles have the vanilla item
hello propokH / I'm here for progressive rando
u got happy flower bc the flower is now happy
items needed: dirt, water, lunar stone, 2 ruins key, and blue key (or was it red)! OH AND ALSO GOOMBARIO
Yo, Phantom. How's the run going?
start of run was great
items needed: water, lunar stone, 2 ruins key, AND ALSO GOOMBARIO
Level 7 Ch. 6? oof
sup, any impressions so far
@ScrambledDragons its progressive rando
excuse me you forgot somebody back there
i was going to say that at a funnier time but my headphones weren't working
you left petunia there to rot
items needed: water, lunar stone, 2 ruins key, AND ALSO GOOMBARIO
oh right, the sewers
bonkers place to grind
from context, is this a progressive seed without the exp cap?
m4, we had a discussion about why progressive sucked
oh i completely missed it
and one of the possible solutions was removing the forced xp cap
but i'm sure phantom said whatever i would've
loading zone rando icebound?
the exp cap is the one reason i don't ever do progressive
what about it cats?
what's forced XP cap?
will it be done
I like the removed limit
the limit made it feel grindy to me
luigi likes tubbas bed smell
it's an RPG. I like levelling. Yay numbers propokP
the original thought was finding ways for making the weeklies easier to get into
it hurt me seeing 50% of people DNF in the latest weekly due to difficulty
i said i'd play that seed but haven't yet
rigby needs this seed :)
i mean you get to fight ch7 enemies at some point either way
yeah dnfs due to difficulty hve always been pretty common,
you get more high scaled fights in progressive, but the chance of getting busted by early ch7 difficulty is avoided
i'm not sure how to tackle that other than add more conditionals to shuffled ch difficulty
i really hope the full gear shuffle can amend this a bit
ch4, 5, 6, 7 at high scales if you have to fight them early are nightmares
i did say 4, tho 4 being scaled high is the most problematic imo
just as far as the fight difficulty goes
it also makes it hard to get items from the shy guys if 4 is high
yeah, while ch4 has no mandatory non-boss fights, the item shy guys are a thing
they could in theory completely stop your progression if you had an unfortunate enough seed
r there plans for star spirit randomizer with loading zone rando? bc if u just do loading zone you could just go right to final bowser :) take out of ttyd extream rando
it's possible that starting at lv2 instead of 1 would help w/this
i saw that vod, yeah. i think within logic you were boned
that is so bad
oh true, starting the weeklies above lvl 1 is another idea that could work. maybe a level 3 start with 10/10/6 or the like
i would support lv3 with 10/10/6
i wouldn't play w/it on my own seeds but like
i want progression in strength to still be a meaningful part of the seed
the exp is why i would not support that
i say we start 30/30/30 and only have to get 5 star spirits
bowser needs to be killable
unless we scale ch8 progressively too
wait is that what was on gdq
yes that was a direct reference
that's such a bad representation of how the community plays this lmao
i am the queen of topical humor
so anyway who wants to submit an allsanity race with me to rrlat6
When will these settings be public? :o
obviously i wanna wait like, as late as possible to get the hottest new features at the time, but yea it'd be fun
Who am I sending a lifetime supply of desserts? :)
who was running it?
items needed: water, lunar stone, 2 ruins key, 1 fortress key, AND ALSO GOOMBARIO
I pretty much live for allsanity maddi so I'd be down
oh ig that makes sense
i'm not saying this is a good reason but he's a fairly big streamer
i was surprised that both pape randos on gdq hotfix were by people had neither seen before nor met on the discord
i was thinking i would do one for rando eventually but right now i'm extremely tied up doing other stuff
i literally don't have time to do randos on the weekdays
"here's my submission video. Clearly people enjoy watching this."
does one have to submit a video? wonder what the other runners actually submitted
ur good on life
cause i think i binge yt videos of pape rando and ive never heard of those guys
for any kind of marathon event, it's the standard
IT WILL BE BAD IF U DONT HAVE COCNUT
i mean that is a video
in the end, any exposition for pape is good i guess
i'd love to cobble something together, or at least some kind of content on this rando since i usually do so well in the races
like i feel like we should have a bowser guide
honestly I should submit rando to more marathons.
i have like 5 different strats i pick between for these dependin gon what i find
soon we're going to have something like ARGDQ
items needed: water, lunar stone, 2 ruins key, 1 fortress key, AND ALSO GOOMBARIO
its the bomb that gives love
its the excited bomb
i think the last like 5 seeds in a row i've had were danger mario being optimal
but there's all cards ending, a lot of diff ways you can build glitchless including one with last stand
charge if you're omega desperate
in regards to full gear shuffle, im kind of worried it'll be used in the weeklies
it has such a good chance to never give ultra boots, which hurts for ch8
i mean, you still can :p
and by now we did fix the most stupid bug
1 item required in a ultra boots block?
the green 1 is kooper
isn't there like only 2 you cannot reach with super boots if you time well
well if 1 key item that you need to beat the game is in a ultra boots block then that will make logic want you to get ultra boots right?
oh, that room, right
you can dark koopa jump for all ultra boots blocks in the sewers besides ch7 bridge
if any key item is in ultra boots block then the logic wants you to get ultra boots... right?
the glitched logic list is stupid
it's almost half the preset file
first pingus are grayscale now ice king
Feeling Fine is unironically similar to the Terry "Are you okay?" meme.
and Mario just breaks out a BUSTAH WOLF
can't say i blame you lol
do some dark star :)
gear shuffle 2, yea
@Phantom5800 turn on spoils log for 2 hours
And the big chests can have a single coin
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE SWAP BOOTS AND HAMMERS NOT EVERYTHING
shops with progressive upgrades just ... break atm, so those are exempt for now
Is that available on the web interface yet or do you have to be all git-hub savvy to get that
almost at 10k points
the web generator will lag behind there a week or three
Hmm, how would progressive in a shop even work, it'd have to change if you left and came back with a new upgrade
turn on coinsanity pls
we have that working benzene. everywhere ... except shops
home from work! how're you today?
Or any overworld spot for that matter
now we can get a coin from boots chest
So hammer and boots can be anywhere? PogChamp
now that you mention it. i havent actually tried coins in big chests ... eh, itll be fine, my asm is immaculate
did you give yourself laki?
can there be hammer and boots traps icebound?
oh, slight fyi, we gitignore yaml files in the root folder if you don't want to wrangle with stashing your edits to the settings
uhhhhh. you know what
you need to add hammers to tracker?
i dont think i set up gear traps
So what are in the big chest?
Question for icebound: let's say you can see super boots on the overworld, and then you hit a block than also has boots. If you collect the boots from the block, will the boots on the overworld change before your eyes or would you have to reload the room.
wear it. you got slow go for a reason
Feeling Fine in the big chest. Let's Go! PogChamp
cookboo check, lemon, not check, cake mix, not check, bow, not check
And same if you collect the overworld one with the one from the block laying on the ground?
so if u get lemon and pan and cake mix u do anti guy
So awesome, kudos to you
i didnt code it, clover did lol, but ty
so if you can buy 3 star pieces for 2 is there a 1 in a million change you can buy 2 coins for 1?
Well, regardless, thank you for all your work on this!!
that man is an asm magician
Doesn't rip cheato also give 3x star pieces as his last thing?
like, the homeward shroom aloine is 350 lines of pure handwritten asm
no way i could do that
I fell asleep early last night, but how was dark star?
360 para and bomb and tutle
Any sense of why shops work differently with respect to progressive stuff?
nothing i could reasonably explain in twitch chat
Have you considered adding yakkey into the pool?
i tried to think of a way also lol
lemon + pan = antiguy
a lot of key items early. that's a good sign.
nah it's a bait
phantom spending an hour to look for miracle water
OH BOY IS THERE A SEED FOR U
oh no I don't like that tone
do u stream later?
today? no. tbh xenoblade 3 made me forget I was a streamer
but gimme a seed and I'll play it on stream Thursday or something
go ahead and ask phantom for seed #69
did you do/watch the weekly?
I tried that and died so gave up
didn't wanna re do an hour worth of work
the 1st seed of the stream was seed #69 and it was good... phantom did not beat it
And then you'd have to use the command line, ewww
making a bps isn't a big deal imo
soooooo you should try the 1st seed phantom did this stream rigby :) it is good
$ ./flips <enter>, then use GUI :p
pls send me link for the seed
flips is a smalltool that does exactly what it has too, very well, and nothing else
so yeah, it doesnt remember folders
phantom was testing stuff right, so there isn't a link
ye what phantom said
i thought of a evil thing for seed
i just have flips in the exact folder i need it in LUL
can i pick some settings lol
give me a sec
cats tries to end Rigby's rando career, stay tuned
i'd like to set up plando some time
inb4 "one hit KO: true"
What's plando? You get to put the items where you want?
Ooooo that could be soooo evil
sorry for that in advance, rigby
ohko isn't as terrible as it sounds
I'll just get first area lucky day and dodge every attack
If an attack would have done 0 damage, does it still ohko?
cats has been gone a long time monkaS
My controller/emulator setup is too laggy for that
I can't even use power bounce
in ohko you take 99 damage from any blockable attack you don't actually block, regardless of damage that would deal
is that allowed in races?
But if you block it does normal damage?
you got a jump
Do you have super boots now?
did that come out from that hidden block
From the one by the pink station lever
ill quickly go check something
Watching/discussing/debugging new features is fun!
this is big shuffle for seed rigby :) no peaking at what settings r
i tried to think about logic and what it would want
Go get another jump!
what is even happening
PLEASE MAKE THAT A WATT SKIN ICEBOUND
I miss when mario had his negative skin
you, hold on, you're using the base patch of 0.13?
brb i need to get food before i starve
that explains the boots
can u add that as a watt skin icebound
i cannot, i am not in charge of skins
turn on traps when u make new seed?
cats, I'll do this on Thursday probably
will u start with 10 cocnuts?
tho clover experimented with random watt sparks number
yo whats up with watt
can i see some clips of it
did u look at settings?
Watt is made of antimatter
ima go grab food before i starve
mind me linking a picture of it?
Buff00n just sent me "PLEASE don't tell me the bot will say *word I can't say* if I type it"
can u start with 10 cocnuts
do you really want random pitch on? 5 hours of that on stream might be a bit much for people to watch lmao
3 times the charm
start with 10 cocnuts phantom?
seed number 72 is the charm
Oh did he ask you that too LOL
BOOTCOIN is good name
He just asked me the same thing LMFAO
The bot will become the paypal bot
the butts file will work for sure
I mean the bot already horny posted about dancer mercedes so
he's already influenced it
ok ima go get food before i starve
@tacoguyy and some single mom from Illinois.
hey now. there's lots of nice single moms in illinois
I mean buff00n is in illinois and a milfhunter so that'd be him
the bot said something about a single mom or something. I can't remember the exact wording.
But I have to open modview
and I dont wanna
it was like a few weekends ago. I can't remember exactly what it said. but u know someone said it's in the discord.
Did the bot swear or something?
We just gotta speak more about flowers and stuff
To teach the bot good manners
It may be futile, but that will not stop me from trying
How often does the bot speak?
bot say something pls
what time is stream on Thursday?
I'm a novice amateur programmer so this will be a fun exercise for me
so is this hammer and boots in the item pool?
3rd time's the charm
i saw a green bombette on jcogs FeelsOkayMan
not like we had a block give literally nothing on jcog's stream or something
We've seen green, red, and yellow Sushie. All we need now is black Sushie.
Have you seen any boots lying around by chance? LUL
gotta bounce, please send any oddities accompanied with spoilerlogs on discord
Even the mansion isn't safe from Tubba
She wasn't lost. She was just waiting for you to find her. LUL
every time i get cozy with maxed out settings there's something new being tested
A refreshing glass of tonic
i cant wait for underwater sushi
Phantom they put out a survey for double down :)
@iAmKrisXx Thanks for the gift sub!
I cant figure out the bot timer, oh well
sounds like a fantastic game
Oh yeah. It's all coming together now.
boom and ham... favorite meal... that i will eat bc i keep forgetting 2
that felt oddly antichimactic
how hard would it be to add the "dun dun dun dun, dun dun dun duuuuuun"
I should add peed 69
chap 7 fo sho
Lv. 7 Ch. 4 Oof
that's what I meant. lol
visited my grandma today and she stole one of my Baja Blasts
@Ohrocks I can't believe she's done this
my gma came to my house while I was at work yesterday and my camera alerted her and she said "this is for you" and flipped off my door camera. lmao
goombario's father is goompapa. His grandfather is goompa. Does that mean his great grandfather is goom? and his great great grandfather is goom(negative pa)?
I watched it happen while I was working. I was like, wtf gma. l0l
that's a copypasta if I've ever seen one
goombario's father is goompapa. His grandfather is goompa. Does that mean his great grandfather is goom? and his great great grandfather is goom(negative pa)?
goombario's father is goompapa. His grandfather is goompa. Does that mean his great grandfather is goom? and his great great grandfather is goom(negative pa)?
did I just write a copypasta??
any long wall of text in a pape stream going to generate a copy paste
ah yes. thr infamous cocnut.
I mean coconuts saved you last sNeed
that's what I mean
what if laki is in ruins!
I like the fanfare better when its a nothing item
could've killed egg with mystery
the best thing of these settings is the possibility of fanfare surrounding goombario
i just found strat-videos in the rando disc see you in a week
what time is stream on thursday rigby and phantom?
for me it's normally 8 pm
you need to update your follower goal lol, its been over 400 for a while now
change it to 500
do the partners change when you upgrade them??
bring back green bombette
make the 500 follower goal dark star rando
500 goal for cocnut% and goal is to get cocnut on race settings asap
in the context of the desert, orange bombette just looks dusty
I'd just make it 1000 and give yourself some time to think about what you want to do.
bomb was just in the toybox for who knows how long]
phatombot making the next seed
bot says you have to do a hammerless goombario start seed for 500 followers
and the goal is to get a cocnut
allsanity, hammerless, starting with goombario. There you go
the quote is in gNenral
@Benzene31415 LOL almost gave that seed to rigby
They have randomized boots and hammer but no alt color for Bowser still?
also I just realized that there's only 2 partners in the game that can initiate first strikes being Kooper and Bombette
i like this bombette
and bombette's gives you bomb for 0fp
he's normal just pale
but para is always yellow
hes been at the tasty tonics too much
what Baja Blast does to a mf'r
annnnd mega bomb is?
power and mega are both 8 fp
trade bombette for goombario
@Phantom5800 RESET THE GAME
all the seed resetting needs to be in vod
thats actually how it should be in vanilla
that would make a lot of sense
i like that a lot
@Benzene31415 panels not rando
i always have i spy on anyways in randos
that 1 coin will make a diff
having panels be slightly different texture would make me 10x more likely to use that setting
what is this path... we never saw this before
yeah streamer i wanna ride the whale again
when watt so we can ride the tuna44
The one time I randomized them, I used the tracker to help me find them, and still ended up spending like 5 min searching for each panel if I didnt know where it was. The stone cactus was really annoying
but the shell is not blue... its... red?
is icebound still here? is the panel thing on purpose?
cake for the lad
the seed not trap
you forgot the ultra stone streamer
I really haven't used (REAL) or (fake) in a really long time
mark cake on tracker
no gourmet guy left unfed
does a certain person get a certain cooking tool
for just 10 cents a day, you can provide this poor gourmet guy with all the cake he needs
wait we skipped goombario?
When is 100% randomizer?
the 100% rando comes when phantom cant find anything
why are you telling lies on the internet, you've obviously seen him
you can't gaslight me
you can get dizzy stomp check tho
There's a reason I haven't made the changes for Big Chest Shuffle yet
Setting-dependent logic is a pain
Logic always leads to you needing Goombario every run
just looked it up, dizzy stomp is before the lava river
okay so White Magikoopas have 11 HP
The builds for WWR that had glitched logic had an entirely different tracker
just gonna say ty in advance for your 100% tracker this is perfect
if u get a lemon antiguy may be needed
you cant do flarakarry or *spike skip*
how do you softlock on lp skip?
i always wonder... HOW DO GLITCH HUNTERS THINK OF DOING THIS RANDOM THING
LIKE THE CRC IN ODYESSY
tell them "make your own damn tracker"
lemon can be gotton
u need to check antiguy
see u next stream
Don't be mean to Bombette like that. She's just going through a phase.
A GRATE PARTING GIFT
I cant unsee her being dusty
goodbye future cocnut% wr holder
with hammer and boot upgrades not forced behind certain partners, theres less pressure on the logic to give you partners early
back bc i saw cocnut in bed
going to slep now so i dont wake up at 3 pm
gamble then i go back to slep
i go now with no gamble
That green fire is pretty pog
Dare I say it's pretty "fire"? LUL
the model looks pretty hot
i forgot to mute tab
you can open volcano chest now
why would sacrifice your 69 Star Points
didn't you just have 5 base HP?
goombario's father is goompapa. His grandfather is goompa. Does that mean his great grandfather is goom? and his great great grandfather is goom(negative pa)?
Ok gotta ask, is this a new update and if so does full boots/hammer shuffle mean bootless + hammerless start?
What a useless item in such an easy to get to spot lol
So then does full boots/hammer shuffle mean they can be anywhere?
Turning on notifs for the YT channel that just posts maplestory music that comes out was a good decision
Oh boy! The next update is gonna be fun!
Gerbert learns to be corrupt
Gerbert learns murder is ok sometimes
bot made a semi coherent sentence
we can practice to be corrupt
bot is becoming self aware
M4 just pb'd by a single second
wait I have an idea
I didnt know it was a command
I was going to make the bot learn to ban people
it only learns from long sentences
is that long enough
always sanitize your inputs
are you using refund
OH! Bombette has a color now!
yes, it is dusty bombette
She looks cute as a cherry bomb
I want cyan bombette
i want black bombette
I want to play Spelunky 2 right now but I'm tired and I might pass out.
after a good sleep
spelunky hates everyone but it hates quitters also
please get it so we get super soda fanfare
what does that look like if your inventory is full?
they should make a setting where it has upgrade fanfare for everything you pick up
that would be so slowwww
You have all the partners you need
yeah it was go mode for a while
ever since he picked up goombario
the only one you need is Goombario
Practically go home mode.
Also every time I do that emote
I search it with :friend
So in my mind that emote is just friend
You could've helped him
when are they going to skip the gulch cutscene I cant stand watching stanley die every run
simply learn stanley save
Big D just said he DM'd smashcon about not being able to go and they responded but they aren't removing him from bracket lol
"Hey lemme help you do seeding by saying I can't make it"
"No we want to fuck it up"
put that one away
someone gets a bye
how hard would it be to do a setting where chests had a guaranteed progression item
hes doing the unthinkable
jumping on that cleft earlier...
i can do this :)
you have power quake and a pow block
youll have to knock 'em over the ol' fashioned way
does quake knock them over?
why cant you beat 2?
ultra boots in peach's acstle
youve certainly got lots to check in 6
real speedy spin BatChest
can you give the wrong berry accidnetally?
added that parakarry to my brain
slow go is boots and big chest is slow go
WE DID IT LADS
well, you got your thumbnail
i got a 4 minute PBN tonight
its the 2nd run so PBs are gonna be common LUL
isnt volcano vase near general guy?
but you didnt have kooper?
is this the same build jcog used?
naw you got this
what pallets are your other partners?
bombette fell asleep in a tanning bed OMEGALUL
my prediction: vanilla bean, palace key on cloudy climb
my rando last night master had 2 necessary checks he's definitely holding out on you
did you finish dark star Kappa
jcog said thank you for playing it so he doesnt have to
kolorado reached in his pocket, "uhhh... here, have this"
im telling you, vanilla bean
arent there some sewer checks
why is the bot actually smart now
If only we had lemon candy
well as smart as a bot can be
bot is becoming sentient
New color on Watt? PogChamp
like janet from the good place
Im going to teach it the right things
yeah but thats a lame move man come on
was good, watched back an old run of mine
when i was grinding in may lol
Meet PhantomGamesBot, it produces enough quotes to entertain chat... or mint one agumon NFT. So let's get in there and smash the block chain. But what'll happen to Phantom's agumon NTF? Yes, he bought an NFT of Agumon to prove he owns it. But that NFT isn't agumon! Its just a hyperlink to an emote of agumon. Cheer100 Cheer100
gonna get something to eat and lurk, glhf man
pink watt is extremely based
Or the Ultra Boots
I never realized how much I needed pink watt
a rare collectable from the mushroom kingdom
phantom is a hater
idk if that's better or worse than puke green bombette
Honestly, orange bombette is pretty pog.
bombette isnt orange, shes dusty
i guess i dont hate it but it feels... off
why dont we have cyan bombette
Cyan Bombette would be cool
see all these WANNABE moles predictors always get it wrong
Laki had your boots all along
they have nothing on me
laki can fly, why does he need boots
to push the gas peda
ahhh yes, yellow yoshi
Yellow Yoshi has the item we're looking for. PogChamp
I've been wrong before
we need a designated yellow yoshi medium
wait you can go backwards
i expected you to break the block in front of the chest lol
what was the point in getting the key KEKW
if theyre in peach's castle ill allow it
untra boots deep in the palace, then the bean is in the sewer, then the palace key is on cloudy climb
id try it tbh
sounds like a lovely friday night
I hate the music that plays right after you beat monstar its really creepy
And there it is
The prophecy has been fulfilled
how do you like these settings?
it might be there
should i be looking at vetting this instead?
I thought merlee was the one behind dry dry outpost?
i've gone through a few seeds but i haven't found anything funny enough yet
yeah that's fair lmao
i'll keep rollin in the meantime
i'mtrying to find something with high comedic value that also isn't too obnoxious
oh ik but like
one of the criteria is goombario start
im excited for the inevitable goombario big chest
the last seed i rolled for me?
i didn't stream it lmao
played up until this happened:
record was where sushie is
er, where the sushie check is in toad town
went to ch3 last
sushie was in the first boo minigame
went back, got record
called bombette being last location in the record chest
and finally i could shake trees
and i just turned it off
it didn't even take that long to get there bc of hammerless start but i was just done lmao
that's enough rng for me today
tbh equipment shuffle resulting in some super boots seeds probably makes bowser strats more interesting
i'm kinda down with that
yes bot, I have seen it
thank god premiere is done exporting a video that works 24 hours later ffs
palace key on cloudy climb
GPU encode wasn't exportingthe full video, would stop at random places. Last ditch effort was a 4 hour software encode.
3 hour world record. 24 hours worth of rendering attempts.
That sounds like bias to me.
why did you hit the switch?
It's a shiny switch. Why wouldn't you hit it
got uh, some weird cosplay going on this seed
I mean you stole his clothes. What else was he supposed to wear?
calc to dictionary to dolly to key?
inb4 Calc has the palace key
wait so panels are more obvious now?
i might run panels then
Rowf has Palace Key
well.. kinda calc to dictionary.
It's gotta be up there.
your nausea is audible
That's the nastiest looking Huff N Puff
can she spook em away
POW Block for the win
dictionary to dolly to key pls
you have the palace key my guy
You had it the whole time!?
spectrum decided to buffer at the perfect time
i never noticed lol
its your job to remember not ours
I wasn't here. I would've said something. I promise. LUL
I saw it but I didnt want to backseat
i usually can't even remember the last sentence i said
I just use the in game tracker
but im not a speedrunner
i checked the vod. you got the palace key in the ruins where the artifact is
ohhhhh i remember that now
1:15 into the run
same happened to jokehow last week he forgot to check off palace key on the tracker
We are in go mode!
we've all been there
You need to add "double check the tracker" to you list of annoyingly long checks
i havent forgotten to mark anything yet but I have seen the last magical seed I needed, marked it, and then just didnt collect it
if youre considering goomba king or lantern ghost or moles, double check the tracker
love it when a plan comes together
sounds more like p up bp down
I like when power bounce is very late in the run because it makes earlygame a lot more fun and strategic
my emulator/controller setup is too laggy to even consider power bounce
I cant mash on controller so my alternative is to setup an alternate bind for a as my leftclick because I can click fast on mouse
so I use that for power shock
my mouse is fine
you gon get carpel tunnel
I think I got close a few times but if it starts hurting i stop and rest
i dont think its something you get acutely, its over a long time
love it when a plan comes together
@Benzene31415 oh well I might be screwed then xd
I like to think I keep a good form on my wrists
twitch needs to hire an occupational therapist
this boss rush ending is just, *chefs kiss*
hiii so question real quick, do you plan on actually continuing dark star for the suffering experience?
I played through vanilla paper mario a second time as danger mario and I barely missed leveling up so much that I would have to upgrade hp
I had like 2 star points away from having to level hp
why does mario trip when he enters battle sometimes? do we know??
if you mean why, cause it's funi
variety is the spice of life
whenever this drops im just gonna learn everything 5Head
5/7 unlocked already. Prologue/2. Gl routing this mess
hol up what isn't in the yaml?
should @ pronyo about that later lol
full sewers clear after ch1 shop ah yes of course
Ima take like a 30 minute nap. Be back for WR rando finish
with panels subtly visible partners no longer block panels
the quality of life changes Kreygasm
Half of the chapters are sphere 0
I think one of these jcog did the last required item was sphere 5 or something wild
could technically still be something PauseFish
you could always go to merlee in dry dry outpost and get the best charm for extra exp
But do you need a key before doing so?
Power Plus 0.69s thoughts: Oh nice, a power plus 0.31s later, baited
You can't get it yet? must be real then, real shit is hard to get
I can believe that statement. Baja Blast is hard to get, but it's real!
Are you sure you can't go 6?
idk what a taco bell is
Taco Bell isn't real, it never was. stickshamGaslight
I think there's this guyy there?
they're just an ice cream flavor
I just see an electrified booger, so
'You'll be shocked when you see this color come out'
store some items before your inventory clogs
uhhh, that's new. i would like that log
I think it was a pow?
well, that is an entirely new bug. must've been in the game for quite a while
But was it something that would've been nice to have?
Ope alarm from the nap went off
I'm a believer that Yoshi's didn't need to be saved
I tried to 100% this game before going to Bowser but failed. That was a long time ago
"I'll probably get laki early" -phantom 40 min ago
Coconut and Jelly, how would that taste?
Lakilester is going to be lurking in the Ultra Hammer chest
he's lurking in a Super Chest
@Phantom5800 You can skip the fight if you give Anti-Guy the Lemon Candy
It's cool for a casual who isn't used to speedrunning and such
Dangerous battle if you ask me
How does a ghost even taste?
O ive been subbed longer then u
my sub got phantom access to playroom. can't put a price on that
What? You left him at the 2nd floor?
I need a reason to play
Save Whacka'a Bump until needed like Bowser fight
btw cats, I'll be doing that seed in a couple hours. it'll be painful
starting location will be good :)
My shock is how he got to the Mansion Boos
that's nothing, vanilla bowser castle apparently lmao
a person needs to do vanilla bowser every so often :)
last time I collected bowser castle keys, there was snow outside
can u send me the strand with ur changes
I'll just approach the seed from a completion point a view rather than speed, like I normally do
I didn't change anything except taking off pitches
I'll give it a begrudging like
when will trading event items needed will be random lol
U DID NOT KNOW TRADING EVENT WAS A THING
Shy Guys scream like little girls!
general guy supplies the world of pm with the bomb traos
the condom adding girth to the tip of the wii remote is a lot more comfortable than holding it raw
the condom adding girth to the tip of the wii remote is a lot more comfortable than holding it raw
no cap tho the wii condom is goated
should get one for my wii remote for my wii u tbh
so I was talking in Ouro's discord about BN2 hard mode and KirbyMastah said, Manipulation is a non legit way to speedrun hard mode That's not legit You need to speedrun hard mode LEGIT for it to be actually proper fifiDerp
bruh, I will manip 5 dash* EVERY FUCKING TIME
even with 5 dash* I still spent 2 hours on B license my first time
also by casual logic in battle network you cant fire your buster because each shot advances your rng by 1 Kappa
being able to walk to Wendy's is broken
tfw no gifs on pma for slow go early :(
I went alone cause Brett is cringe and my roommates passed out
fuck it i'll make a quick video on it
"I wonder where ultra hammer is" -phantom hour and a half ago after finding the other upgrades
wait shit I can't type the emote on mobile
oh I did Jr skip on joycons on my flight
I had my own music so it was less purgatorial
delete it off your switch, you lost your privileges
I can lzs on joycons and im proud
I'm surprised joycons lived through that tbh
honestly the worst part was the jumps
joycons hurt my hands with the buttons
Blake had a pair of those on the flight
how do you like glitched logic so far
if there's stuff missing that should be there, make sure to bring it up
is going staight to red station with laki via the shortcut on there
that should probably be added than
lets you get past green station hammerless
bow and laki and train without any hammer would be very rare though
well it might as well be on there
I want to see a STS seed
and that's when I walk in to enable them Kappa
if jp glitches were allowed than it would let you beet the full seed hammerless
just for that I'll learn it
It's time for me to play rando again
only time you need hammer now is for kooper puzzle
do u know that toad likes to take off coat?
That would be really sick, wouldn't be able to play until Saturday i think tho
What glitches do you enabled for checks?
wdym chapter 1... thats chapter 7 -_-
I'm definitely interested, this list is extensive af
what speedruns r the short 1?
I'll take a look at it when i can, that would be super appreciated
open big chest for cocnut ?
what even happens if u hit the real kooper?
u can get bow though... unless it has to do with chapter 6
I wish Watt was guaranteed to be found even with glitches
prob wants a 1 min time out
that's actually an interesting idea though
like what if general guy could be in lantern ghost's spot
i thought there was only a magickooper for a sec
chapter 5 and go back to checks after u can get the needed items for chapter "1"
the real kooper is the green 1
yeah potentially having to dip back in here is just too annoying, best to check everything now and come back later with palace key if that's what it comes down to
and when you come back you can just beeline to ck
the real kooper is the one that sucks ass
the real kooper is the one that sucks ass
one of my friends is a proud koopa enjoyer how do i tell him he's not my friend anymore
you've seen more fake blue keys
send him a video of kooper skip
you should just drop it on em raw maddi
raw like a wii remote without a condom?
@Maddi_SR translate "im not your friend anymore because you are a kooper enjoyer" like 100 times with google translate
all good suggestions thank you maddis7Noted
you could also pay to have them assassinated
that way you could avoid the conversation
i bet the hitman will take 50% off since they'd be removing a kooper fan from the world
i want to find a wild lp
just make that 1 line of text Japanese
dang i was gonna guess it was the other seed
the seed is in chapter 1... i looked it up
"Kumba King is beer one" - closed captions
He gave you Last Stand for only 10 coins though
"a bluebird tried to scam me so hard" "who did the show fails in a power stock tank." - closed captions
"break the bonds of the same time"
"sunrise me"... HOW DO I SUNRISE U PHANTOM
"so i should have power shotgun book gang. Sprint is your mash"
jump on his head 17 times
"why. why what did i ever do to you and that guy"
"other than what i just did to you what have i ever done to you"
That exact thing. On multiple occasions.
Did you do all the Boo's Mansion checks?
"like he has to be somewhere"
"did yes i did. I went upstairs did booze portrie something something something cuz i. i just realized theres one check i havrenet done, i can think of. cuz i never went into this room. the badge anyway. i did the forest
i didnt have a carry the first time on mountrugged something
gimme a few min to eat my ice cream
oh no! I'm late. just got home from work. what'd I miss?!
I see no bow yet. yikes.
phantom, we can use custom tags on twitch now
I dont get a shit about the discord
tonight Im just practicing the main comps... no pun intended Kappa
Well, you're about to meet him for the very first time YEP
go mode laki in glitched logic? lmao
just waiting for stream to start for u rigby :)
You're coming up on 300hrs total play time.
randos are pretty fun though. so there's that. (: at least fun to watch. xD!!
do chapter "1" so u wont regret it later
somehow every glitched seed I've seen so far has been without laki
lol. @ilovecats923 you say it everytime he passes those slots. I've only seen him hit the slots once. l0l
it was 2 shy guys and 1 coin
And hope this isn't Ultra Hammer
Did you do Ultra Hammer check when you were in volcano?
Is it possible you turned on the setting and didn't realize?
There's also always the chance the key is in the palace
They say lightning doesn't strike twice monkaS
Oh, tracker thing regarding glitched logic: I plan to add a toggle to turn off map logic in general but for glitched logic I think it should at least display chapter completion requirements correctly
I mean, I would hope not more work than adding logic for every check in the game
True but a lot of them only affect a few checks and not chapter completions
I would rather just turn on Toybox Open
just came in, blue house skip is in logic too?
so when's the all options + glitch logic?
I guess Laki is cool too
oh it's neat that you can set per glitch
Just to let you know I am saving up points to make you play a certain game
No like Super Lucky's Tale Discord wouldn't be there because of me
I'm not LUL but other people are, I started it from 1 person (me) and now at 100+ followers
Hi there! so I haven't played PM rando in awhile. what is glitch logic? the game allowing glitches?
SOOO I hope I host for you reeeeally
I'm going to stick around and watch this ^_^ Very curious
but Glitchless Paper Mario would work
Being my favorite game and all, I hope I can talk about it to you
Are you playing for GDQ or something?
I've never heard of that marathon
I am very excited to watch the whole of the this mystery? I have no idea who killed who
So do you play a lot of PM rando on your channel
how the speedrun going? i found youre channel on youtube and have been binging hardddd. keep up the good work!
so does that mean harder glitches = important key items?
Dude just threw a bomb in your face animej1Char
That's a welcome change! I haven't done one of these seeds in forever. Might be time to do another
It's always fun to watch glitches because I have no clue how to do any of them
I love the fake item setting
Just get golden oink logic and I will be happy
So are you enjoying glitch logic?
Have you considered no logic one day? Kappa
and it was before while typing on Xbox
What do you estimate are the odds of a given no logic seed being beatable?
So what you're saying is that the game is broken enough yet?
is chapter 2 ch 1 difficulty?
they gonna grab grub since they had forgor.
The Koopa Bros were trying to get to Flower Fields. Kappa
Have the mods considered Randomized enemies?
also omg you litterally have kooper be regular koopa
interesting, bug fables works much more simply: an encounter is just an entity line which I already have an editor to edit manually
they are map based, but sit separately
So changing the enemies changes the map?
yeah same with bf, but because of the entity system, it's p flexible
nah i meant gulchy gulch was my favorite
shiver mountain I'll upset people, but I think it's OKAY at best
also this palette looks....too good to have been random lol
like you can't tell me it randomly set the palete to ttyd grubba
ok I thought they were random
So many good OSTs in Paper Mario. Gusty Gulch, General Guy, Lavalava Island, Tutankoopa, Lava Piranha, The Master fights, and Final Bowser..
final bowser used to be my favorite, but I realised it grew stale to me
sad sun is however VERY up there
it will beep in our hearts :)
I just now remembered how much wiiu vc lags in that room when the bridge breaks
at least it didn't had the stupid lag on pause wii vc had
Oh god when was the last time you gave her the berry?
Now this is a big booger.
thats good, im alright someone broke in not too long ago
i got em st the least
Ah, Lanturn guy. Just some random dude afraid of the light.
Paper Mario's 3 wisemen: anti-guy, gourmet-guy, lantern-guy.
I'll take the herb, but I don't want to know where it came from
im 200 points away from 30k
You did free someone after braking lantern guy
I am nothing if not entertaining
Well now you really cleared out all of the guys
Really fucked up that fantastic 4.
Is bombette cosplaying as a Christmas tree?
He just had a pretty good time
I caught him just past the 3 hour mark on final Jr
Oh for sure. I'm learning clippy just for rando in places where it's useful
just reviewed the vod. No. Twink didn't appear.
We don't know if we got blue twink until the end now? Sad
How precise is the oob movement for the sushie glitch?
Wait does twitch censor t w i n k?
Guess I'll add that to my list
Cuz I just see ***** in a few recent messages
That might be a you setting?
It's a bit quicker? Showcases cool stuff.
Sub 3 if you turned in melody before checking stuff in 6 and 4?
I showed back up when you turned in the berry so idk how long you were just doing checks.
Love it when a plan comes together
gotta love it when you raid right as the target is raiding
Did you get ultra boots 5 minutes in again?
Wait, you never found the ultra hammer?
Not casually in a bush in koopa village
Would you rather: close call or feeling fine?
'Scuffed final let's goo' I'm so sorry
Good guy phantom, unlocks door and doesn't steal
OH BOI, MORE GLITCHY RANDO RANDY sNeeds!!!!!
also back home from work with some grub
I just saw some of the vid of your random sounds playthrough and oh my god ow my ears
now you're making me hungry, I'm gonna have some leftover indian food
my wife's birthday is today and this morning she wanted to do Grillbird (delicious teriyaki) but texted me awhile ago that she'd rather do it a different day. My face: SirSad
Taco be gaming at smashy con
oooo, so rude to give you food blueballs
meh, it's ok. Yesterday a neighbor gave her 3 massive doughnuts from a local shop as a gift. Today she texted me a picture of a whole box of these things from a different friend she met today
we have a lot of giant doughnuts now, I am not sad.
I want a giant bagel, extra cheems
gourmet guy will give you the best partner in the game
I've seen it in black pit
snowman doll is the best partner wdym?
do you know ch 4 scaling?
can't wait for the all normal sNeed except for 2 checks being different
you should find a different donation center, bot.
bot doesn't like the person who got his plasma
I just noticed Blue Mario. PogChamp
heartgold complete in box and white with manual
HG came with all the inserts too
HG was 50 bucks and white was 15
before bu ying I didnt think about all the attacks being in japanese OMEGALUL
"its pokemon, this will be EZ"
yo got a quick glitch question
for quake hammer w/ laki, what do I do after clipping in
ok next question, why am i getting oob and softlocking lol
so ill be fine in the rando then
it has the S A U C E
I didn't know you could do that
Oh yeah today Splash told me Bibarel is a platypus
has this person ever seen a beaver?
In his words he has chronic stupidity and it cant be cured
Whats the scaling for world 1?
I forgot that you have captions lol
it's not doing a very good job right now
I mean, I'll take free STT
But stone caps are col lookin
this orange bombette has me feelin some kind of way
go mode laki again lets goooo
greetings from the land of the virus
Didn't you just see a different Dizzy Stomp too?
i probably wont finish but im curious
if its super cursed i might do two days and actually finish who knows
ah yes the "best" one :tf:
i don't actually know anything about not glitchless sorry
you really dont like that jump huh
if you find 2 good melons then you won't need a partner if you know what i'm sayin
I have bomb pushed early whale.
i cant wait to do a all glitches including npc pushing
it took like 15 minutes to set up but my bomb pushes were suboptimal
it's like relaxingly therapeutic to me??
stressful in a run but fun otherwise
it's like playing diablo 3, my brain is not on, i am simply pushing this npc until it is against a seam
doing bomb push early laki in any% feels so wrong
He gets you into Tubba's Castle YEP
toad lure > whatever the fuck this is
think ive done parakarry method once, long time ago tho so I forget how
fighting the urge to order take-out cuz I'm getting ramen with friends tomorrow
GO BACK AND SAVE THAT YOSHI RIGHT NOW
all of these appropriate inappropriate gasms.
also, in mario party superstars, yoshi shakes his booty at the start of every turn
wish they had done that with wario too
oh hey now we can do several things NiceSoftlock
Balanced. As all things should be.
You were just too far back
the bot is trying really hard to be coherent
if only it said "Prologue" instead of "Chapter 2"
I was wondering why you did a full charge. That answers that.
click the partner, show the little blue circle symbol. click again, put a second blue symbol
why are lyrics and melody at the end of the tracker rather than with the other hand-in-ables
are you gonna switch it to be based off of the boots and hammer upgrade as the user manually clicks them?
I might do that logic at some point if you don't get to it
Like chapter 5 normally requires: Jade Raven and sushi plus either (watt) or (odd key and bombette) or (super boots). But with shuffled big chests wouldn't you just also add ultra hammer?
twice? ew. i've got a hell of a time doing it once
Hey you can beat 1 now YEP
i see it was a loosely forced goombario seed
I clipped the "loosely forced" moment
Oh! Seeing you stomp those boards reminded me: Yesterday I stomped the board in crystal palace and it broke but it didnt break my momentum and I went straight down to the spring at ground pound speed
I think that's just intended behavior?
I thought it normally kinda stops you and then you fall at normal speed? I guess not
Do you? I think you have the other one
Plus being in the right kind of block gives it credibility
LOL, whole room chasing you sans the one snoozing
especially considering the game wants you to be using bow every other turn to block the big attack
dont remind me of the shrink stomp blooper pepeW
I wanna see what it looks like when you hit stomp the board there
I wonder if its faster to hit the middle and zoom down if you do need to go down there
Did they remove the small rocks from the gulpit's arsenal??
I had to look it up to make sure I wasn't going insane. They normally have a few small rocks and a few big rocks in the background that they can lick up
"There are five Gulpits' Rocks that always appear in any battles with Gulpits'three large ones and two small ones'and the amount of damage the player takes depends on the size of the rock spat out at them.

did you turn in volcano vase? its not ticked off on the tracker
prefacing all my work emails with this
just compost the stinky herb into fertile soil
just smoke the stinky herb and forget you're randomizing
I can't use all or nothing, I get too nervous and psych myself out
I mean, P = NP with good RNG
Prayge ultra boots in hidden block before peach's castle
man just d-down jumped on a poison pokey which is spiked ontop with no def LuL
always blame the inputs, trash game controller smh
whats the new controller looking like
do you even need L trigger for paper mario?
ive tried playing on hori but oem z spin feels too nice for me
i think i just cant get used to z being on a shoulder
i still cant believe nintendo made both the gamecube controller and the joy cons
who tf needs soup in a desert
I know that I didn't. But I did mention that the Switch joy-con were teeny tiny
mmm yes consistent movement is a good thing interesting
what sort of software do you write? games?
gl with the rest of the run, gotta bounce
as a modern controller i kinda like the xbones
its hard to mash on x box controller
My most hated part of the 360 controller was that BLOODY D-PAD
power shock is a scam. bless the backup dizzy dia
We need to use more punctuation in our messages, I suppose
ah, saw the key wanted to make sure there wasnt a dope thing in there again
ah yes, the 2nd "-guy" fight of ch4
Phantom5800 might hate saving Yoshis more than he hates Goombario
did you double check the tracker?
whaaa? whats wrong with healthy juice =(
no problem! just finished the main story of mario rabbids, now onto dk dlc
the music is all DKC and DK64, so am happy
I love that he got to return to his old work. Not everyone gets to in situations like that
I mean to be fair, saving Baby Mario was a pain and five halves for Yoshi
Mario sometimes just SACRIFICES the poor guy, just for a little extra jump height
mario should have to carry the yoshis on his back and listen to them cry whenever he gets hit
Mario is not a good person
whupped Jr's ass in front of Kent Koopa
i have a little pad for that
I did a hammerless seed and had to come back for whacka
and i woulda forgotten if i didnt write it down
it had laki for me today
wait, why didnt I have to go back for whacka?
just knocked over a can of pop
WHILE THE DOOR WATCHES HIS ASS-WHOOPIN'
could the ultra boots be in a block you need ultra boots to get?
they weren't in the Star Shop, right?
drew09452, cheers for the sub, mate
First it was no hammer, now it's no boots. LUL
You could do a quick seed, have you tried doing seeds with fewer than 7 star spirits required?
I'm drinking rum + cherry vanilla coke
he's doing another seed, stick around!
oh i work those 3 days too
paycheck comes the friday of the trip tho
sleepaway soccer camp for 5 days -> camp work for 3 days before MWSF
they pay me the good coin
A rare collectable from the mushroom kingdom
how'd they stuff ALL OF THAT into a gif
its 150 at normal shops and 200 at boos mansion
Lol on the same chart its showing me that mistakes sell for 20 coins at the shop in bowser's castle
ESPECIALLY if they're proceeded by Watt(s)
Is this like above average luck for early game
holy shit are you still on this seed?
1FP Shock? Ya love to see it
you know for a fact im making you get goombario at MWSF btw
this is just how its gonna go
Isnt someone vetting a seed for you?
nothing says randomizer quite like fixed luck
They can make sure goombario will be there
oh yeah i saw mitchflowerpower yesterday PridePog
his live run of smb3 was hype
a live show grandpoobear was doing
it had like linkus, cjya, xwater
last one you didnt have a card like 90 min in this looks a bit more open
surely it will be a baby seed
cookbook! watch out for that antiguy!
that run the other day with 6 minute ultra boots was sick
did you get a legendary goombario already
I sent this to TacoGuyy lol
ch5 is so fun because you play so little of it
Chapter 5 is good cuz you can skip Chapter 5
So you full cleared except for dizzy stomp
chapter 5 is good because of Thicc Yosh realbl6Yoshi
In 3 hours after youve checked everything else you're gonna come back to the volcano and find the pyramid stone in the dizzy stomp chest
so I did the seed you made me
all I have to say is what the fuck did I ever do to you
goombario start and go mode laki
bucket was in pit and laki as snowman gift
though I did get to do raph skip and stuff, so the glitches part were fun
super hammer was in volcano and jade raven in sewers
I watch a lot of your seeds lmao
I tabbed out. What'd you get?
Get it trending on Twitter. LUL
just realized the BN collection doesn't have Network Transmission
People care about the WanderSwan EXE game?
I legit don't know much about it besides that it exists
I think you and I have very different definitions of "fried"
I really like fan smack also
I think my favorite moment in every rando is the koopa bros color reveal
Donatello is my favorite Koopa Bro.
my favorite Koopa Bro is Shredder
i bet the yellow one is very resistant
I used cheats to have level 3 jump and hammer off the bat
Must be nice actually not needing the bubble berry
They need to get better at haggling. My god
I call nonsense on that Power Shock not working
Ok can you share some these coins? My last seed I needed 110 in 1 shop.
Bow, frying Pan, mailbag, power plus.
Of course the mayor had it in his dresser. LUL
the baby seed is gonna kick in any minute now
Your Snowman Doll has upgraded to a Doll made of Snow, man.
seems good, excited to see =P
why was this dude hoarding a child
Kolorado heard chat call yellow yoshi a bitch and wanted to double down
Kolorado had Goombario as a hostage. He said "Aye, Mario. Be a good show and hand me that vase and no one gets hurt"
"It's a BET. LAY IT DOWN"
'Got any more of them vases'
gonna hit they hay, good luck with the rest of the rando! night
laki is accidentally the best partner
Flower Saver too? Shy Guy's Toy Box is pretty pog right now.
Stuck doing glitchless runs since I'm the goombario of clips phanto274Shrug
im gonna be using the glitch logic options as a checklist of stuff to learn
Should make him orange for halloween
Just use the 8bp flower savers jcogSmart
Why does he have power bounce when he has no feet
Vanilla Huff N Puff though. WutFace
Close call and lucky day strat?????
Rosie had what we need for once
And now you get to do it again.
is it weird to call a plant cute?
purple is just a top tier color
damn, when'd you switch to Dark Star Bombette
When you try your best, but you don't succeed.
Good to know that Bombette's a Coldplay fan. LUL
Great against ONE of Bowser's attacks.
Block the fire, ditch the badge, got it.
And then a 5 Cap to wrap it up.
Oh wait, we don't have blue key. Kappa
Lyrics check for Tubba's key though?
Heals your status effect, but leaves you frozen.
I think this seed is compensating for the other seed that didn't give you an ultra shroom or jammin jelly.
@1STSTAR__ Night, 1st Star. Have a good one
i have school in a week i need to fix my sleep schedule lol
One of them HAS to be the Tubba Key, right? Kappa
They really really want to give you a POW Block
A Sleepy Sheep and 3 star pieces? Dang, bot. You scary.
You took Tubba's Key for granted.
Plot twist, ole granpa Russ t has the key
You were in Go Mode all this time.
That's not Tubba Blubba. That's just a bigger Clubba. LUL
You've been streaming for 7 hours, don't be hard on yourself lol
The YouTube vids are what got me into rando
Heck yeah! Never thought of Pok'mon rando
tbh I kinda want to watch more ww rando, but not many streamers ik streams it
oh btw I just got informed my avalonia pr got merged
Bro looked like a wacky pack toy
This is for all the marbles.
I don't know, but you know what. It could be worse.
I wanna hear how badly it messes with gulchy gulch
It's painful but it's not THAT painful
Vanilla Peach, Twink, and Kammy? What is this?
I didn't sign up for this. LUL
It's the finale. He has to make it difficult. LUL
Hope you all have a great night! See you next time
Classic. You go online as soon as I roll up to my job lol phanto274Tea
tis a rough time, it would seem
Gl with your race! I'll try to stop by on my break
I work every day basically lol gotta make that money
so can anyone enter the race?
how does these races happen nowadays? is it still srl?
any new settings on the race?
Shooting Star, Diamond Stone, Peach Doll, and Jammin Jelly. Means anything?
yeah you ONLY have 1/13 chance to win, p unlikely
Oh, I watched Zelda Randos and never knew that
i would get my butt kicked lol
does it still work with an irc thing where you .ready and stuff?
imagine getting a notif 10 mins late pricelKoopaMove
I sometimes try to pull up all the participants streams. I think this time I'll pass, my poor pc lol
won't stay long because I'll async this after I find food
Good, if you're early, you're o time
I remember back in the day, we had .filename to enforce a filename on go and you had to enter it to verify :)
i see rip cheeto isn't on there either
hey they can program it themselves if they want :)
been watching your runs on yt for weeks, excited to finally catch one live!
If you ever feel the need for autotracking, hmu for rando ram data
you can websocket on everdrive wtf?
13 people without me what a turnout
SO CAN YOU MAKE AN EXTERNAL COMPETENT DEBUGGER?
cause emu debugging is painful and makes my nose bleed, but hardware debugging....
skipping on this one, still salty about getting burned looking for all 4 seeds
if I wasn't hungry, I'd eat late and join
ill be lurking when I do colonel tonight
ever since watching more and more randomizers, i've actually taken to thinking about how game logic works for different randos
I peeked the backend for this one, it's a lot of graph theory which sounds interesting
well KIND of available, it's a frontend to a tool that isn't
icebound overr here doing gods work
The python is probs all you need to understand the randomization
good luck to phantom and no one else
changes to the core mod are basicall just engine modifications
I actually was thinking about how I would structure it and it seems that I would first do a SHITON of docs, then do a base api to not just be a rando, but modding in general and then do another plugin that uses it which will be the rando
so it's like a 2+ years project
java is only good for one thing: ghidra and MAYBE if you play mc
I use openjdk for star rod, works okay
i think i only have java cause minecraft
oh what, what're they doing over at the poke rando lol
omfg stop using java when .net 6 is multiplat guys!!!
cant wait to see gamesbot talk about NFTs
i know that pain all too well
friendly reminder to fight LP :D
I can't even recall when an arch update broke settings, the worst that happens is dependency...which is annoying, but at least it works or it doesn't not "well kinda"
windows is such a well programed OS, right?
he has yellow hat, so this is goombwario
in jcogs chat i did "good luck to phantom and no one else" then followed up with "fuck wrong chat!" KEKW
Are you playing with vanilla letters today?
I want that last stand to be fake

I stole your HP chart, thanks for sharing
Also, I've just learned about Darkstar Edition and psykitChaos
I made it into a spreadsheet with bright colors lol
dark star is the definition o fpain
Looks impressive from what I did see
As far as technical work done to change the battles
Rip Cheato practically giving way his piggy bank
Yeah, this looks like a slow start
i have a feeling merlow might have stuff
Merlow had 2 ruins keys in my seed yesterday
as we say, randomizer giveth, randomizer taketh
I actually just wrapped up a Metroid Prime 2 seed that had Amber Translator on Amorbis > Dark Beam behind that
glad I could make it towards the start! gl on the race!
Amorbis is the first major Temple Boss
Almost had no special weapons for the fight either
i use a gamecube controller nowadays for basically everything on my pc
I use a GCN controller with a raphnet to a wii remote adapter to N64 KEKW
i've got a bunch of those wireless gamecube controllers for the switch
You say that, and Yoshi Shop is unknown
Let alone Boo shop and Chapter 7 Ship
Oh yeah, 2 Seed Chapter 6 entry, forgot about that
if squirt is low ill upgrade sushie first
sooo what you're saying is, MORE MONEY
Watt is frozen in time KEKW
that is quite a rare item placement
that might be th elogic needed to progress too
oh god, this might be a knowledge check for the other racers
you can access the lake early liek this?
Yeah, Sushie + Bombette works here. Honestly so far this has been super convenient
only downside is all the dialogue
and watt opens up quite a bit
okay this seed has been spoiled I cant play it now lol
how much BP was the power rush?
I had to close and reopen stream.
wait, whats stopping us from just breaking the ice?
and now my dogs are going crazy. so I must depart for a bit.
I mean that's kind of a Pow Plus after a bit
okay I'm back. hopefully didn't miss anything.
Early Power Bombs are always a good thing in Metroid.
Early power bombs mean super late normal bombs, tho
i really don't mind. you get more than you lose
Oh, congrats BTW on winning the weekly that went up this week on YT
3 Power before Boots is nice
i just had a horrifying thought. randomized cooking
i still think the bombette clones in ch7 should be random
you never know, parakary or Lakin might be there too
i remember as a kid going through this place the first time
it's the same with the lost woods in OOT and woods of mystery in MM
i just know the path lol
i forgot how youre even supposed to know your way through lost woods lol
i just know it from memory
2 letters on Mt. Rugged YEP
there's no letters in the shops? I can't remember.
a lot of the letters were out of reach cause kooper as well
at least this isn't dark star, cause whakka
you still wanting a few more star pieces for what merlot has?
you can buy your way to 3 letters too
oh god, that means super blooper is gonna block prologue
You didn't need Parakarry to get the Train, did you?
@drew09452 just wait until they're 5
nvm, looks like 4 or 3
6 PF Pow Quake and 5 FP Pow Bomb......yeah naw
How does laki get you anything on mount rugged
Sheesh, +3 Pow before a boss. Well at least offense ain't a problem
You can get over the yellow path now right
not gonna check by puff machine?
I wasn't looking, what was that?
when did twitch get rid of the any% tag?
and we cant use % anymore
you can search for any% but no results cause no one can use it
smash charge, dark star ptsd intensifies
I feel like people can remember the tags they used to ude
And now they can add ones twitch doesn't have that might pick up
They're case sensitive as you put them in it's true
I think some people set up tags once and leave em forever
dogs were going crazy again. but looking at your checklist, it doesn't look like I've missed much.
So they didn't notice getting reset to zero tags
yeah, i'd put up tags once and never change them, except for when randomizers
theres only 16 people using AnyPercent oof
if parakarry is bow, then chapter 4 would be huge
Heading off to church. Good luck phantom!
i mean, all or nothing is decent, but we need key items, get with it parakarry
@TheMasterDS right now yeah, and some arent even speedrunning lol
Go back to being vanilla Parakarry
Who ordered the bot to roll this?
To quote rigby: It's always moles
parakarry and bow would get you the most, i think
true. of course, there's that super blooper to worry about
one guy is using the tag "funniestguyontwitch"
Did powerbomb really save you anything there over just a regular bomb
it had to be something, cause last location
I think we know the thumbnail. The mole with its tongue out
Also all the key items here, huh
are you full clearing this chapter before you leave?
what's the laki one called? Flakilester?
it's not like you don't have enough of them.
hopefully vase chest has something good
I had extra bits for whatever reason.
this is feeling like one of those runs where you need to check every last thing
I'm saving for the 30k pm rando. bahaha
but It'd be a generous rando I feel like. I don't think I'd fuck you over too bad xD! or is that what I want you to think. teehee
@iAmKrisXx you gotta let RNG screw em', otherwise it's not as fun
that's kind of what I thought too.
wow the hoops you had to jump through for him
kinda clutch tho. ruins with 4 keys but no parakarry wouldve sucked
all 3 bloopers, vanilla 5, and moles
about time we get that full gear shuffle fixed and to main ...
Any idea how glitched fares in terms of time reuiqred?
inb4 chapter 4 is 7 scaled again
bot wants the sad doggo music, apparently
idk would feel kinda mean to remove the sad doggo music. what monster would do such a thing
Don't worry PhantomGamesBot, I would never remove the sad doggo music, that would be cruel
is anti guy in logic rn?
we're what, 6 items from go mode?
bruh, so much of rando using vanilla
the only 7fp badge move is mega quake
Ralph check after this star spirit?
What partner did you start with I missed most of the stream :(.
lol. selling his own calculator. lmao.
you doing another rando after this? or just the race rando?
the search for 2 keys and scarf
i wonder how the others runs are going
cause this seed has some wacky pathing
like this is basically 100% location at this rate. minus dojo, koot, and trading
jcog has 4 fortress keys and scarf
you've got him on chapters complete tho
he's missing 2 tubba keys, lunar, and palace key
if goomba king has nothing, then water stone probably will
oh damn, forgot about that bugger
Required Goomba King AND Moles AGAIN
i have learned so much about this game both in watching rando and playing rando
It would be ppl who did Blooper 1 early if any
Nvidia kept me overtime this week but I finished
I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't paid
my favorite times when it's a key item, but actually a trap
did you say someone finished already?
off to make dinner; gl and don't die
if bulb is relevant, i think youre likely behind
jcog went 7 without palace key
yo where the smash con watch at.. wait y arnt u in smash con lol
I think it was Laki that was the vase
my clip started at 3:12:17 right after you got out of the pipe so im not sure how long it took
It also matters whether you were able to break the boards for the shortcut the first time
kill w pow bet you wont
peach got that matching lipstick on bawkCoffee
Win this thing again! Let's gooooo
dude this was not close with jcog omg
like he is rn getting the...flying tubby thing lol
i did blooper chest and water early
and goomba king when i went to prologue
yeah i had just enough when i first went
i also did yoshis after beating 5 and had aoe to deal with them.
I think you did amazing. (: just some things were unfortunate and out of your control.
damage badges so op this seed
yeah i gambled when i got the diamond stone and hoped the last tubba key wasnt in the cstle
i think im always keeping 2 dizzys around for a possibly super blooper now days
it's because you named the file 'cheating' l0l
l0l. damn. what a seed so far. sheesh
the shop is selling their own guys she'll. l0l. wtf.
ngl hammer and boots in pool is way more what i want in general but races would be scuffed
the objective of getting to big chests makes routing on the fly for races simpler
I know that rando was declined and I was like aw sadge
Mario HATES Maple Syrup. The madman likes his pancakes/waffles without that stuff.
idk if I will end up going or not but maybe change my submission to remote
is glitched logic coming to the website soon?
looks fun pretty hype to try it
its true ultra boots in koopa village was wild
was everything he had good? my god
damn cheato! he was holding out on you.
I am digging that bombette color
you think we getting a laki re color at all?
maybe change the color of his cloud
it went well untill I decied to last location yoshis and gooba king
yeah way easier in the ruins
i found the ruins easier bad at timing the spear guy
I did everything long check the first time I was there becieds those two which both of course had items
blooper wasnt the fastest with goombario, thats for sure
I usually do bloober pretty early it seems like'
oh god I almost used the bubble berry before finding laki
the badges in that seed were really good at least
pretty sure he was in 6 somewhere
I think he was in the red path
I did end up using the bubble berry because I was in 6 before getting red berry
it was weird how there was nothing in c4 besidies kooper right at the start and nothing in c1
yeah I was 4 items away from go mode like 1.5 hours in but than I couldn't find an item for like and hour and a half
who fights lp these days. ick
I would be fine skipping l[
its not a hard skip to learn
mostly because you do c5 first 99% of the time and it gets boring
so like making c5 faster is good
Ooo, blue bombette, gold bats, red pokeys and buzzy beetles? Top tier colors.
Super Boots! PogChamp... And then a Volt Shroom. LUL
l0l. the ultimate slap in the face.
This game shakes your hand, and then slap you because it can.
i left for 15 mins and you found both boots upgrade
the only use of feeling fine i can see is dark koopas
but when you fight them they usually died turn 1
or the dark koopas don't move 1 of the 2
Vanilla HP Plus is pretty PogChamp
last time you did this you said the laki tp wasn't in logic why was that?
imagine stepping outside for a smoke, only to run into Mario approaching your hideout
i don't even remember what it like to rise the water stairs
i only see you do it in races
i been thinking about joining a race but i cant cheat and i think u have to steam for it to count
if someone don't steam you wont know if they cheat or not
@blacktiger51 if you're worried, you could always record your run
i don't have anything to record with
when's the seed that has all the Koopa Bros. wearing the same color
i have a decant pc can run halo infinite on 60 fps 1080p
i only have a gtx 1650
The realization that if you encounter fake Goombario, you'll see that as a W
my friend steam on his pc and he cant run monster hunter rise
feel bad since i want to play that with him
it's big compared to running Pape
remind me to never try this
i know this not hard but its look hard
its whoever stuck around from the JCog raid
how do you enable glitch logic? Is that just based on whether the physics glitches are disabled?
"Lady Bow's gonna be mad if we let Mario have this Super Shroom!"
Watt was taken from one dark location and placed into another dark area
But that leaves an important question though: Why didn't Watt just hover outta there? LUL
She didn't want the person in the well to feel lonely
@buff00n Aw, that's kinda wholesome. <3
Lily pad, why do you have an Egg
what did you plan to do with this egg
I didn't do anti-guy I know that
you uploading that race to youtube?
No artifact and kolorado camp tree because I was already in go mode then
I did do vase after doing Crystal Palace fully
nice yeah i miss it wasn't here all day i actually touch grass today
So Watt I already had Sushie and super boots plus warehouse key
IT was the only thing I could do at the time so I went to ch7
I did 1 then did 5 because I had Odd Key. Then I had Bombette from storeroom
It was barely possible to avoid Super Blooper
I didn't have here at the time
i only know about bombette thing cuz of you
That was my only way of getting into 5, so I was forced to do that
but surprisingly did super blooper first try
Do you have Defend Plus or something?
Why did that do 6 then?
i didn't know he can skip that heal
Imma clip that so you can send tat as a possible bug report
he one of the few bosses i know how he act
Clip menu bugged out and I couldn't get it
I don't know how to go back other than through clip and if you miss the window, it's gone
i don't think that work on mobile
I still don't see the option
him freaking over the shroom cake specifically is funny to me
None of quake hammers are good?
2 more items until go mode
as bad as blue house skip without hammer or laki?
that impossible i don't know how people do blue house skip like that
i try for over a hour i said yeah no
Finally figured out the clip thing https://clips.twitch.tv/IronicBrainySpindleHoneyBadger-ZXwjamAsNvfldqZY
the 2nd jump to too hard to get got it once but couldn't make it in
he has nothing of use atm
isn't it middle stairs for that jump
i never seen it i was just told middle could be wrong tho
that probably what i was thinking
yeah stuff like that is pretty dumb
yeah i agree if it stupid I'm not doing it
Ah the room where feeling fine has a use
i have never seen that do damage before
If you do end up going for the jump, I recommend tap-jumping up rather than right
Both work but I find up easier
Yeah leave that thing on the ground
putting that in my list of never try this shit
I'm fine with Gap Skip but LZS is a hard NOPE from me
watch palace key be there too
i am never right so its okay
Or goomba king, somewhere fun jcogSmart
i check there once 1st visit and goomba king had something
If you went straight to 7 and found your key there on the way, you'd probably be fine
since it glitch logic pulse stone could be in bowser castle right?
Would you risk that for the chance of a PB?
just replace with a junk item
Do you have a chance at PB at all if the key isn't in 7?
i totally forgot he can do that guess i got lucky
The bucket being at the bottom of the icy pond is kinda ironic
Which is faster between Scarf+Bucket or Sushie glitch?
is susie glitch as easy as it looks?
every time i had both item so i never got to try it
Well now we really hope mega rush check isn't palace key
I'm hoping it's in one of the pedestals
So would this be considered Dark Kooper
If it's here you can still PB COPIUM
As much as I would love to see the end of this run, I need to go to bed. Good night and good luck!
yeah i know that but you cant fight them
thank god it wasn't on mega rush
17 mins to beat the game
bowser just have to not heal once
maybe last stand will be up here
i seen a speedrun with no saves and they died here
that was a really good final bowser too
i grew up with that game
Great job! See you next time
how we doin today tho phantom?
your streams are hella poppin bro, GGs pricelHitMeUp
well deserved phantom, people shouldn't be missing out your streams josuraCozy
got a fever but I'll push through shrimpsSus
Brett dodged my moneymatch offer he knew I would win free
you did beat 6 Kazuya Mishima CPUs
I actually just never saw him after friday LOL
69 mill for you to play elite smash pricelKoopaMove
This was the first event I have outplaced jaemi without directly beating him
yeah I noticed you don't have your 3dw PB in your about me josuraGrin
Our co-op run is the only thing on my src lol
I forgot we had another roommate LOL
I'm trying to be Mario for that run
oh wait this isn't randomizer LUL
I knew it wasn't but damn
Oh also I did jr skip on joycons again the other night to show jaemi and I got it in like 2 tries
Why am I good at it on joycons
took me a bit to take it in SeemsGood
@LeaderboardMods ban this guy I can't read it
Odd question, but how long have you been an active streamer?
share the link to this stream to Pok'mon Speedrunners to scare them
Ok apparently I just hit my 2 year affiliate this month lol
I just checked and I have a 24 month badge
wow I really have 2 dollars under 100 in my twitch
cuz it you're just that deserving of it
I finally got payed this month lmao
Oh yea talking to Linkus was fun
how juicy was the payout tho? B)
Didn't even realize he was going to that LOL
I told him I played wario and he asked if I used bike throw and I was like "YES THAT SHIT'S BROKEN NOBODY ELSE DOES IT THANK YOU"
Why does he know but nobody else does
lmao well glutto does it ;)
he at least did it against onin
Gluto always just drives it back off stage for recovery later
My bracket path was lame asf but I'm glad I did well
wait phantom, what's your GSP?? if you still remember ;)
cuz I might save up for the channel points reward Kappa
Beating olimar into steve was not it
Then I lost to yez for 256th
I have everyone in elite and I regret doing it
wow a normal run been awhile since that
I mean in november he'll likely stream it if we play at the house lol
Idk I haven't fucking touched that mode since sora dropped lol
Like wifi is fine for practice but quickplay is ass
imagine banning funni block man because no one knows the MU?
I looked at his resource bar and abused gold-less disadv
It came out on like friday so I was probably at wendys
I would offer to do the first one but I'll be with buff00n
Cause I leave for illinois on the 14th
They allegedly fixed reindog up air
Also a bunch of endlag got added to mvs in general
I can jr skip but I can't block that
ive never seen a double dink im down
Mario just didnt wanna grab it
has anyone made the "this seed is crazy" joke yet
the vanilla Goombario and chapter difficulty
did you remember prologue coins :tf:
I'm only 45 minutes late! let's go!!
oh thank god i was worried
how about we go back in time and forget they exist
no reset run into 10th try speedy
it's gonna be there now and you'll be disappointed
you can't get this wr by going for it
can i have uhhh none pb left splits pls
it was real, and now it'll still be real when it says +71.4 in a min
for some reason i had thought you had a low 2x
sub 22 prologue is a myth
yeah you can def mid/low 21:5x
you were improving a ton last i remember
the timesave comes at the cost of being mentally unwell and resetting prologues
I'd reset for an encounter and that's about it
or tattle goomba king or something silly like that
i mean who would do that haha
yeah, who would do that huh
yesterday during the rando race :)
i didnt notice they shortened it lmao
one of the coolest cutscenes tbhtbh
i just don't even look anymore
5 min split and over a minute is cutscene
this is what it costs to be a randomizer great
i didn't do the back 4 in palace after finding the castle key, i didn't do the bombette puzzle, and i didn't do the pit
i think that was it? so ig 6
did they make the weekly rules good?
oh shit it's mx_four from twitch.tv/mx_four I'm a big fan
they are good for the intention of the ruleset
can you sign my blunt weedMario
Oh I was thinking of the one you pb'd
i haven't really done any glitched randos since assumed fill
yeah i have no idea what that's like lmfao
i feel like it'd be slower bc it requires you to do slow things
i'll prob be busy with my project until well after it comes out tbh
i want to make a beginner's video guide for race settings
PhantomGamesBot: i got SO MANY GOLD NUGGYS IN A COMA phanto274Love
Wait going into a coma gets me free nuggys?
time to perfect the microcoma technology for infinite nuggies
I was just about to ask about the parakarry split but I think that luck comment tells me LOL
he accidentally went to check sewer blooper
But it's still fun to ask :)
parakarry probably didn't actually lose the third letter and it took him 1:26 to notice it was actually stuck to the inside wall of his bag
im ready for the training arc
Had 2 runs get to CircusMan, but neither were particularly good
I heard, GL on the marathon runs!
rando muscle memory is hard to shake. i don't think i could play lttp normally anymore
cause in base game, i run to kakariko and be like "wait, why is it all rupees? oooooooh... right"
imagine if homeward shroom was vanilla
i feel like nintendo would make it go to mario's actual house
probably. that's how they work. lol
just wanted to pop in quick, but gotta run! GL on the derust!
I actually got home early today from work (dentist) but I've been trying to nap, that's why I'm late. lol
n000. I went to the dentist. lol
after spending 1500 dollars. that hurts worse than the root canal. xD
I don't blame you. I only have a 15 minute commute.
nah. I don't have the patience for that.
alright, im done waiting, dse when?
when are we routing glitchless dark star
I saw someone talked about it in Jcog stream 4 days ago
only if you enjoy playing it though, because the start was ROUGH
are you sure it's Jcog? i watched the vod and only saw x4
i would love to see you 100% dark star
DSE is not like MQ, in broken ways
how far in did you get
i enjoy watching it the start looks so hard
i have a lot thing to say about that vod
and chapter 3 was just unfair
Tubba is actually incredibly easy, it's possible to beat him with mega curse x3
no shame in safety saving. (:
if Tubba heart has <5 HP, he will end battle
i cant wait to see how hard chapter 6 boss is
personally, when i saw you having no merlee spell or power rush, you only option was either tank his hits with 25 HP or something or zerker
stone cap isnt invincibility in ds so i really dont know how you beat that lmao
ye after i did a normal one i got to lava piranha
wdym, you can get power rush in vanilla before ch3 and after ch2
idk how you even pushed yourself through that beginning honestly. if it was me, I would've rage quit so early. lol
time to start up the 5hp run again :tf:
ye fair, from a speedrunner perspective, why would you do that
i didnt even know where the chest was when i did glundo
im so happy you didn't sold the Gold shroom
very good he says, i can tell you have no idea LuL
for whatever sick reason im thinking about that early power rush now
The bighouse twitter is irritating as fuck who is running it LOL
In ch3 you have access to a some sick stuff, which i expect a speedrunner to miss mostly, i mean, why would you check the previous apple crates, nobody does that lol
They're just constantly @'ing and begging top players to come lmaooo
thank you for your input, bot
I can't believe he lied about waking up at 6am.
Boo leaf is the most shady item he add in the hack
he told nobody he added that, not even in the update reports
or i dunno what u call it
update log, i mean, my brain geez
you always miss while dizzied in dse
be back in a bit. dogs are going crazy.
ye don't expect ttyd in this hack, that hack is more inspired by bug fables
played bug fables till near end of ch6
it rly feels like dse to me kinda, the... ye
i liked bf enough to 100% but i havent wanted to replay really
actually i own it twice so maybe i do like it
also, i have to say, the 3 options you pick in ch4 dse
ch4 is good stuff in dark star
i think it was my favorite of the 5 ive done
the weirdness of dse starts at ch4 mostly
someone did do a glitchless speedrun, but ye, been a long while
weirdly enough, you didn't needed to buy a lot of POW BLocks lol, you just kinda stall with jumps and goombario or something and use sleepy sheep
they heal 2 every turn theyre asleep
omg they heal 2 hp ohhh nooo, i can't deal aoe dmg anymore and hit blindly any enemy i want
you just kinda sleep all enemies and kill one after the other singlehandely, not hit all of em at once lol
ye, he didn't like you skipped buzzar
weird, everyone and mostly people beating tutan said he's too easy
i mean i was lvl 4 or something and beat him with ease
you used the most terrible strat, ngl
The real question is why was that shy guy hiding in general guys pants
I mean who wouldn't want to Flushed
If you don't look at the platform he's airborne
it does 5 dmg, 6 against aerial
you don't know how much i pushed him to make hammer throw relevant
assumption are 2ndary, primary is testing it out yourself
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO AGREES WITH ME, geez, that was not rly my mindset, i told him to explain it in text but that one guy say, the player should experiemnt
while playing dark star i kept getting the feeling i should be playing on emulator and save stating everywhere
playing on everdrive experimenting i so punishing
ye, he apparently didn't fix all the laggy areas
i think the star temple is the only place lagging hard? i hope
i dunno why, if you say the star temple lag is unbearable, surprised nobody rly said anything about it
i can confirm star temple is like sub 15 fps in most places
i totally would go check but i rather not go through hell to get there
go out of way to level up nah
only time i would level up is for a super boss or something
RF usually has level rec's outside of the dungeons and I'm like always double them lol
i need someone to talk me out of trying 5hp again
i cant stop thinking about it
Yo donkeykongsdad just followed me on twitter
i couldn't beat the extra bosses in 10
they just made the account and are followed by nobody
yo is this vanilla difficulty Chapter 5 Jungle?
i agree with you but i still don't like doing side quests in rpgs
if it a good reward i might do it
that cycle looks way to free on jp
are you still allowed to hold down at the end of the game?
only if the rando devs used the jp version
ohh i was thinking the devs pick English cuz more people had it
i know the link to the past rando use the jp version
Actually fighting LP? What is this
I'm not seeing a lot of green.
Sure you can, look at what that one online GDQ runner did
i actually couldn't believe that guy did that at agdq he was good at that game too
I really do love your sense of humor. Haha. I always have such a good time here.
make your file name "Steve" so the run can be banned
I've definitely caught you on a couple grumpy days.
Gotta modify your game to say that too now.
I was JUST about to say
"Save the Luigis or kill the Luigis"
You should hammer throw those moles in ch6 empero125Thamz
Nah he must get stuck in the pipe cause he starts going down with you
time to waste good rng on this run Prayge
So, in what ways is the Japanese version faster?
im excited for back to back lightning in final
someone told me that for the switch fight in ch8 too
surely they would accept a lifeshroom
And one second from getting caught on the transition door between areas.
woah never thought of that lol
i hold b the whole time lmao
Ever done a 100% speedrun of this?
Well I learned what that was today lol
just do hundo without lzs how much time could it lose :tf:
I'd love to optimize the route
takes way too much brainpower tho lol
i fricked myself pretty hard routing wise
yeah the items should be overhauled
i still cant believe i fought the wrong blooper and saved after
most of the routing was from the og router guy
dark basement now will be nice with brighten room cheat
You normally use laki for hurricane there?
What's the probability of 5 cap on ch7 jr
16% chance of losing the run for 5 second time save? Easy
like 2/3 for a 5 cap iirc
it sure didn't feel like 2/3 when i grinded any% lmfao
My brain can't compute non-rando anymore. I'm like 'oh vanilla bucket!'
two golds so far is nuts
What's your technique for mashing a and b at the same time?
I like using index and middle
You may just need to switch it up every so often to rest muscles
flat thumb works best for me but it always feels awkward
I hate it when I'm too buff to button mash
Soooo' that music randomizer woke me up this morning LUL
People sleep with YouTube going? Lol
Is that spinning and hammering just for fun? Or does it do something
I 5-0'd a bridget player lol
I like falling asleep to vods
That MU feels omega nice for millia lolll
But I shut off auto play
and also everyone is bad still
I put several clips of me perfecting bridgets in my discord lol
they fucking changed 7tv how do I work this layout now 1 second
The result of living in party houses from age 18 to 26, can't sleep without noise lol
I see a potential time save on shell shot, can you let go earlier?
It looked like it was starting for the bottom
Donkeykongsdad unfollowed me after I retweeted
I don't think he likes dusk arknights
Do you actually use shell shot on final bowser?
What the fuck is this thing deb just posted on twitter
its a cotton candy shake, cotton candy ice cream, with actual cotton candy on top, with nerds on top.
I think that kills you if you consume the whole thing
Lol I was absolutely expecting boss rush
Oh yeah, I forgot this cutscene exists
At least you don't lose xp for running away
That's some cool movement with parakarry
I always thought it was odd how ornate bowser's castle keys looked. They should be more menacing or something
I was only at the smashies because Linkus was there for the grandpoobear thing at the same time
Linkus asked me what the fuck they were doing LOL
Typical speedrunner, justifying cheating in a glitchless speedrun
Only when sushi is out?? That seems very odd
he heard you did a glitch WideKirby
can you fight the anti guys for fun
oh damn, last I check you were in prologue lol
There should be an antiguy% category
You must fight all 4 anti guys in the game
triple anti guy mega shock is the easiest mash in the game
why is there so much cum in the kirby emote search
I just finished a park run i am depressed
i got a 2:19? it was good
Lemme bring a wii and a wii u to mwsf so we can park 2 race
it was no reset so yeah thats pretty solid
Just wanted to stop by and say hi, im hungry rn im gonna go grub
Dennis look at this stock photo I found that was just on 7tv
Or save the 2 turn for the marathon
I don't think I'll ever be able to top my finding of el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
I am in the depths of emotes rn just to find the bullshit
oh shit I found monado emotes LOL
All this rando rng coming full circle
Peach giving twink p up d up every turn is OP
stop the praying, you making him lose time
She should be going first each turn tho
'Why can't I have peach as a partner' - Mario since his inception
Oh yeah, time is peach arms
wait will it be sub 4, why is it still going jcogEyes
Bear if you want your lurkers to get jumpscared
He's right below you on mine
Ooo yeah. Thumb mashing has not been fun
x4 is playing metal gear rn
Yesss glitchless is my love language phanto274Love
18K dropped frames by the time the raid went thru
can i drop a link before yous start
they actually hold the games too
so youre part of the problem!!
PhantomGamesBot: If Prologue has a million fans I am one of them. If Prologue has ten fans I am one of them. If Prologue has only one fan, that is me. If Prologue has no fans, that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Prologue, I am against the world.

I have a base PS4, so having PS5 run them is a world of difference
Came in and started chaos phanto274BLANKIES
b is one of my favorite buttons
It is super nice running ps4 discs on the 5
i have ps4 games i never played like the 2nd digimon cyber sleith game
i just care about the story
Cybersleuth I got stuck like an hour into that game, kinda confusing but it seems really good
Just smooth brain here I guess
mitzi's dog chewed up her ethernet cable
how likely is speedy spin to be there each go?
oh wow so 4th try is 1 in 256 =/
i still have only gotten 3 rerolls max Sadge
I'm only 25 minutes late this time! hi phantom and chat. !!!
damn! I live for prolog! xD
so a 7 means youre REALLY good then
at what point do you stop considering it bad luck and start considering it good luck
damn am I just a bad omen?
22 03 is still good imo.
you need CLR for that derusting
Lol I need some for my shower actually tho
Calcium, Lime, and Rust cleaner was funny to me for some reason
Just saw the times for your NoGA runs, woof those EST times
whats the prize for correctly guessing fuzzy trees?
I do it all the time
and by all the time i mean twice OMEGALUL
give them VIP for the month
I mean, what are the odds multiple people guess the same answer let alone if they'll even guess it
have you ever gotten a 1st try speedy?
you just need to get on rowf's good side
It definitely changes based on the cart Kappa
I feel like that PhantoBot could probably get 50th try speedy with some RNG manipulation.
why is it possible to be very unlucky, but never being incredibly lucky?
I'm stressing before I gotta go to work permitDead
I'm sore from yesterday BabyRage warehouse job kicking my booty but like in a good way
I played hookey and went to the beach
uh started very small on Saturday and got hit hard on Sunday so... almost 5 days
I think when I went to LA to work at an event there, that's what did it.
why doesnt peach use her OP p up d up focus ability in this fight?
also you didn't save before the fight
It's just my legs that are sore. It's like I'm just doing squats for 5 hours straight cats4eSad
Job building me a better booty and paying me in the process win win
I still don't know how Bowser's Castle went unnoticed in this game
Just restart now its already bad enough
any plot holes in paper mario can be explained by the star rod
theres really no rng in prologue right?
youre very good at holding b tho
appearantly the bot was 50 zenny short. I wish I had some zenny to spare.
How does whale swim in water if its made out of paper?
how does Mario not combust into flames when entering the volcano?
has anyone won the slots? l0l.
I'm inching closer to 30k channel points. lol. at 13k now.
Looks like Goomba king's blasting off agaaaain.... *
That was where Attack FX B came from, huh
It was the end of the Koopa Bros cutscene
*random* I just remembered I'm probably roofing tomorrow. boo.
I do metal roofs for commercial buildings. which imo is better than shingles. l0l. and omg. that's ridiculous.
can't even take the time to strip off the old shit? that sucks.
godspeed kris, heart goes out to you guys
good. cause almost 70 years is a long time. lol
trim? like at the end of your roof?
I will die on the hill alone
that counts for something Axl. right?
I would redeem bad rng but dont wanna throw points away
I just wanna see you phanto274Rage from getting a 141
I changed my mind on saving for 30k channel points. I'm now saving for 69.4m
also since you need energy drinks, may I suggest Baja Blast Energy?
i almost have 1 mil in jcogs NiceSoftlock
hi i cant hear but gl
im stuck in a dorm help
Where do the other enemies come from that one guy.Where do they appear?
also 3dw got into pace but it wasnt me adaencSOB
milo asked what game i wanted to run instead but irdk so i said pokepark
You can stop spinning for mario The can't handle that pressure.
offer hammer throwing moles in ch6
20 minutes until I can throw my clothes in the dryer and then it is time to do some serious relaxing. lol
What is the maximum level up?
execution points are very tight empero125Thamz
@DukeMondream thats the undertale thing Kappa
rando makes you want to do all the checks?
Mario is tired of being spined around all day.
Getting tired of getting spined all day. like Mario
Hope mx_four still streaming, for raid :P
I can't Imagine 1st person on mario just continsually spinning.
why are you running back to the start? just homeward shroom. phanto274Shrug xD
and you won't today. I believe in you!
Got my 7 month old watching with me. Teaching her while she's young!!
Hey! I just started learning Glitchless today and its a lot of fun
Cool, itll be like an instructional video lol
Although i only got to ch 5 lol
A great habit is playing this game period lol
Yeah, i need a break from looking back and forth from the doc and the game its tiring
Yeah theres a lottt of intricacies, i just know i'll like buy one less pow block than necessary yknow
that text being rng annoys me way more than it should
i wonder what the range is for the text coming out
seems to be more likely than not
witch star spirit power is your favorite
what do you do for maze fight
i wanna master buffer spins so i can become tas
i think im gonna touch up my route tonight
i wanna add bombette first strike and stuff
I love glitchless runs. That and 100% runs. LUL
why is his theem so good
Time for my favorite part of the run. <3
thats kinda why i wanna try risky
i mean im killing runs to final with the safe route anyways
Isn't Goomnut Tree only viable in 100%?
I'm referring to all the recipes in 100%. You need at least a goomnut to make nutty cake. @Phantom5800
need nut cake for koot too
i also have a question for m4
fright jar -> air lift would still be the play i think
even if you double dink you'll air lift, get peril, air lift, then air lift the solo
Eh idk why but for some reason i just cant see glitches as a real "speed run" its more like cheating. Not trying to be salty but its just how i define it. Real speed run is actually playing the game fast
so if somehow pb this run I'll Doordash you an order of Carne asada fries
i tried playing pape and it was very bad
then i had an mgr run 40mins in on 54 pace and then fucked it up
i would've probably considered taking a break if i'd gotten that time
or do a glitch get wr and then gaslight the mods it's fool proof
what are the odds they check ch5
i think arie was in my chat when i hosted
what's ace why are you talking about ace this a glitchless rub
i had to make a new twitch account on my phone because the password reset didn't work
I mean idk but this is looking like pretty good pace for a glitchless rub
thought you could fool maddi_sr huh? pathetikoopa.
if you still have 9 bp you'll need to take ice power off too i think
how did i miss all that
fun surprise in like 15 minutes
Is it for money or for battle?
the implication that i would ever prevent seeing more cocnut is RIDICULOUS
This is an interesting set that they use for exactly one battle
i really like the pink fish
Yo, Chet Rippo. Time for Danger Strats. Kappa
in that battle scene there's a pink fish that jumps out of the water
looking at my badge collection on 3DS, i actually got all the fire emblem badges lol
so much wasted money, but hey it let me memorize a credit card that is now expired KEKW
was it tho? would you call a crane machine gambling?
i never thought of a crane machine as gambling
According to the Nevada and other state and international gambling laws, arcade games do not count as gambling games for two reasons. They are games of skill, where players have some control over the outcome of the game. Also, arcades do not pay out money or any representative of value.
Probably a similar situation to the Japanese pachinko loophole
just pasting what is law LUL
yesterday I just unfollowed someone for changing their content and I just now got gifted a sub LMAO
its been over 40 seconds LUL
The most graceful 40 seconds I've ever seen
I went with 40 because deathnote
my best friend from high school sent me one. Was awkward getting that in the mail. I keep it close so "no one else can have it"
really close to the source material, only thing they forgot was to rip some pages out
Light did carry scraps on him after all
I found my DK64 pencil box!!!
IT HURTS MY EYES TO LOOK AT IT
one of those 90s 3D covers
He's dead. Dead, I tell you.
God, I'm too used to rando. Was expecting you to check the letter
the star kids are yellow, wtf
Super happy fun platforming times clintThot
Does it just involve jumping over these bullet canons
Im listening to Steven Universe music to feel something
Forgot that SU has some bangers tbh lol
Well this is the 1st time my cat has seen me in 3 days so he wants attention lol
I forgot how violently you kill a child
do not hit time when you get the star rod
The opening of that song is so good
Is this part skipped in rando?
Even in rando it's 2 minutes
lol, why's her broomstick just hovering w/o her
I forgot you had this super long cutscene
been watching on youtube a lot lately, finally caught a stream
I didnt know you had a youtube
And paper mario origami king apparently
How does slushy live above water
Also is the fish named slushy or sushi bc I know its one of those 2 I think
Ah damn I missed a 1st try
Still better than me according to the wife! Catch you all next time
Preps rando seed w malicious intent
aw man i joined too late :(
You should definitely rest the day before
im gonna start using japanese tags cause fuck em
you are running pape in jpn afterall
ive heard pokemon runners say, "how do i know if im confused?"
fever is gone but I'm tired
yeah i try to be out by 4 but things happen sometimes
how dare you call Prologue a cutscene
anything after prologue is a inconsistent film
why are you doing the goomba king check?
and why isnt it itachi Kappa
naruto taught me you dont need a great story to gross over$10 billion
just found out my dad got sick from me. glennj5SWEAT
even bleach was over 7 billion
im excited that the anime is getting the intended ending
I hope you are having a great day.
I see you started with the goombario.
I shouldn't turned the brain off and said 1,2,3
Goodluck with the run dude! shiftLOUDER
For glitchless there like 2 routes right?
Yeah I was gonna say I know of the spook one but it's kinda rng lol
Also just don't get hit, and the optimal Don't mess up 4Head
Is this the category you play the most?
Have you done any% with all the glitches?
You ready to watch me win smash and strive
If I lose in strive it's ok because Millia is dogshit
Ohhhh sick you're gonna be running there?
Yea I mean may as well
I was about to say I should do that too LUL
I have a good marathon vod to submit now and it's good motivation
Add my marathons to discord as events
I want you to purposefully ignore feeling fine in a hotfix run
and say chapter 7 isn't bad
Some cool games at that event I just looked at the schedule
The only thing that'd make that message better is if the bot put a Flushed
I wanna do an in person marathon one day. Seems way more stressful though spaget3OhNo
Gimr is too bald to think that through
Smash gimr? You would think they local record their tourneys I guess not lol
Oh Gimr profits off the smash vods so he def would care about those
Gimr only puts effort into what makes him money lol
Oh that's right they did speedruns for glitch I remember
I used to be super involved in competitive smash lol
Next year I'm def not aiming to hit up any gimr events
I wish California had a speedrun event shiftFeels
as long as you come to combo breaker
This check is so slow you must be desperate for an item
I hat kinda controller do you use?
I replaced half the shit in my battlebeaver and gave it to 74 LOL
Especially the control stick their stuff is not it
Oh okay are you playing this on emu?
Ohhh I didn't know there was n64 adapters lol
I use a hori mini for N64 speedruns
Linkus uses one cause he has baby hands
They're pretty sick I like the control stick on it more than og N64 controller
It's like a gamecube control stick LUL
I got used to it but I can see for people with bigger hands
Ok gotta go I'll be lurkin spaget3Wave
Guess I won't do 100% because the rules doesn't fit with my definition. Thank you!
Guess I won't do 100% because the rules doesn't fit with my definition. Thank you!
i was trying so hard not to lose it on that guy you don't understand NiceSoftlock
but I wouldn't be opposed to star rod timing
Quick escape on sundays, LP on all days right now apparently
I spent the whole afternoon moving boxes and shit into the basement BabyRage
if it was closer i would be even more poor :)
im convinced double bomb doesnt exist
i dont know if your vods are trustworthy Hmm
my gold is double bomb god cycle
I don't have a watt split anymore lol
actually was probably 3:50.xx bc I think green station was bad
can't wait to decline this run
taking this one to the pape supreme court
Playing on a cart not emu right?
this is only the second time ive seen double bomb
I am so PUMPED for my noodles AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I am so NUMPED for my poodles AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
pumped to numped to cumps to cumping to cumge
I was just happy about my noodles. How did it get to CUMGE
i would say it looks more like sweat OMEGALUL
i dont know if ill ever do the fast lure for this guy
i just wait for the dance
ill take my guaranteed enter with a little rng i dont mind COPIUM
climbing up this tree sometimes gives me an aneurysm
the whole game is spin jumps but those spin jumps in particular BabyRage
I guess bots can get thirsty too. Kappa
I think my favorite thing your bot said was something about toad showing melons for 10 dollars or something
So it's allowed to walk off the corner like that but only after pushing the blocks?
It was from a while ago
But it was so funny lmao
jumps that LOOK like glitches tho Kappa
double bomb 6 cap im leaving
honestly wtf is your rng today
its because you continued that 4th try speedy run
game said "he's been through enough"
I feel like all my time save is in chapter 8 cats4eWiggle
or a significant amount is cause fuck practicing chapter 8 BabyRage
what the pink fish that flies outta the water in the background of that fight?
is bowser very hard in this category?
Unless this is just the perfect RNG run
Bowser is a jerk in all categories cats4eRiot
a 50% coin flip at the final boss sounds terrible after a 4 hour run ...
You're going to do safe fight for the marathon though right? monkaW
clintT how is the fight you do now different?
if the run is good then obviously it will be beat bowser, otherwise its bad
is it just 33% for taking something with butt stomb
I literally shit bricks at bowser everytime anyway so a risky fight would fuck me up even harder LMAO
i arrived at the perfect moment to see you get fucked
i don't think i've ever gotten all 3 of those in a run
and i grinded this for a long time
Right? Phantoms game is on crack rn
Bot makes perfect sense for one (minus the random ping)
listen I can believe enough for all of us. Bowser will be nice this time SURELY Kappa
i'm not doign either which makes it weird that you got lucky today
my bowser rng is normal usually but my everything else is fucking awful
Save the rest of the good RNG for final
run will die if huff is a jerk tho
shell shot, die to puffs, jump x2 shell shot
if you're on spook you just die
oh and we not doing that so we gucci
i haven't thought about this in so long
it is not run death though unless like 45s is ggs
ok yeah the fight i gave you is accurate
the backup for ck is switch to watt adn let him heal
ok imma be lurking while organizing the basement! I hope the luck keeps on giving! cats4eHug
after i come back from fl i'm prob gonna grind this again very briefly for a pb on the new rac route
I was looking at the lb and it's wild that RAC is faster than glitchless
beforethe most recent breakthroughs (of which there were a lot) it was still faster but like, barely
i was really proud of my rac pb and now i should pb by like 4 minutes for free lmao
i guess that's one way to get me off my ass
log skip can also be lzs :)
i don't hate myself THAT much
The dolly trick to retrigger prologue?
it would've been during my any% attempts when i was going for 1:42/1:41
where i was doing time out and never got past jr
my log skip gold in any% is fucking ridiculous
if i don't do lzs and then have 1 extra fall on the other method i lose like 20 seconds
okay. I'm here now. done eating. beer in hand. I'm ready for some phantom paper mario!
it's like 8-12 faster even if you do both methods perfectly
did you not eat one after the bee
"Don't forget the kool john" - captions
right buty ou had to eat something to get 10 hp for laki
The last time I added shit I literally just went to the most recent shit and clicked on things that were there LOL
how do you think I fucking found el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
God when you hover over the emote and actually look at the cat
What if we smooched on goombario instead
dont leave me in the dark here
did lopez @ the bot or did the bot @ them and say hello LOL
it's just as true today as it was then
"do you think of a single white mom adores me"
We need to remove buff00n from this chat I think
He's rubbing off on the bot
Why did he defend his rando settings to glenn
is that any mom, or a mom thats single?
"oh I gotta do another rando, they've added so much today, will be slower go"
I want the bot to el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
el:wadafa is my favorite thing I have ever seen
yea phantom commission a el:wadafa emote
I would do that if I didn't already have tacogu1Hug
You could always make your split bg an emote
what did ohrocks do to you?
I would ban him but I cant
"I hate ohrocks" Phantom - 2022
Wait bot made sense again... it's learning monkaW
It has no idea when it makes sense... which is why it's crazy that it says it has no idea when it makes sense
its more like fall guys that fortnite
im not convinced this is a real thing you're talking about
i see kirby i buy, no questions
if you PB will you delete this vod too Kappa
Phantom has shed all wordlly attachments
if phantom pbs i'll delete the vod
I want cumge visual explanation in your pb
I'm the one that doesn't get shown cause I live under a rock
God I'm organizing like' a 4th of my clothes rn' I really do hoard clothes a tad cats4eDead
then you have Axl, I have one pair of shoes and slides OMEGALUL
I used to work at a shoe store so I have a million shoes too.
we can still see you LUL
can you even see anything? that's crazy! 0.0
Arknights dc'd me when I rolled and I'm unsure if it just took my shit or if it gave me a dupe and I don't feel like going through each unit i have to see which one got a token lol
i don't mod anything so i am safde
ARIE! thank you for the sub
i got a sub from your channel, oh that was jami LUL
up 6 is the new down 2
Omg I found my bacon Halloween costume
it was stupid I had to buy it lmao
did you burn a life shroom or somethin?
It pleases me that your splits don't conform topramWIGGLE
1 sub says you get a 4
you just threw for a sub
We love getting yeeted off bowser
did you see the pencil box?
ill ask bowser to give you peril
i just realized this is pb pace yooo
this guy is fire heavy wtf
bowser firing every turn except turn 2 lmao
THE PB HAS CUMGE EXPLANATION LMAO
I can't wait for cumge to be posted into youtube
Oh yo is this a PB
Oh shit it's a stinky guy
buttstomp is so scary here on turn 2 now
glad I could be here to witness it!! w000 LETS GO!!! PB!!!
For real tho this is awesome! congrats!
Fright Jar on Moles? Double PogChamp
throw out your spare carts and only use this one
my pb missed jr block too
did you get double 3 capped in phase 1
that's so scary without ultra watt
remember when I said bowser would be nice?
he knew I meant fire but did buttstomp peril, what a prankster
Today, a PB. Tomorrow, sub 3:50
Man I just missed it papeHands
I should change my name to fake Axel
@morpheus080 what do you think of this emote kutyesz
Bowser taking the hammer is pretty generous.
The rigby bop incident of 2022
Later, Phantom. Thanks for streaming! <3
I'm so happy I can listen to your stream while I organize in the basement phanto274BLANKIES
YAH I'm putting all my clothes away since I got the second box of my clothes cats4eWiggle
Oh yeah god rng is ass to run against lmao
Then there's me who has getting speedied in my pb lmao
whoa whoa this ain't worlds y arnt u watching worlds .. cmon phantom lol
I like that they're doing the KOF mode now for standard play
Looks like I got here just in time
I watch it only for pokken lol
MADE IT ON TIME! LETS GO!!
unite was ok.. it did get hype at first then It got boring
game is ok.. there were a couple hype moments
but that game is also very dead besides the EU scene
the only one i was good was overwatch
I used to be super in to call of duty.
God I miss the mlg days
they have the technology to do it. lol
What I like about the current dude running the last HotS league left is he's very good about showing the core parts of gameplay and covering each scrap that happens in a lane or at an obj
I think rocket league has a good commentary.
I've watched rocket league pro players or whatever battle it out and it was good.
That's how I am with league of legends and I consume that almost daily
None of them are funny except black plague + coney and none of them know what they're talking about lol
I haven't watched League in a long time, but back when I first started LCS League commentary was really good
You need a talk fast and hype person and a person who knows what is actually happening
It's the main man himself, Goombario!!!
that's just bad luck. that Goomba was out for blood
wait you have to generate seeds by building the whole binary?
Now that there's a break in the entertainment, chat on your overlay is MIA?
I w a s gonna say that earlier but thought maybe I was the only one.
you could replace it with a slabs one for the day until they fix it
trying to remember from long ago
window capture pop out chat itll look great
Can make an overlay and manually fit it in slot
lmao I haven't opened SLOBS in so long
I used stream elements for chat
Man I really detailed the stream
that's okay know. we're all Still having fun. (:
Phantom's view count comes mostly from people reading chat, not watching the gameplay
and the text should probably be white
I'm a 30 year old child. lmao
you can also add custom CSS
what kind of seed are you rolling? race setting?
i mean, fitting to the theme, could use a paper mario font
courier new is a fun one
sometimes twitch chat just breaks at times
I can't remember if this has been asked already, but what type of rando seed are you rolling?
Rando but all the items are goombario
whatever you want to do! I'm just here for the show! (:
I am a fan of the hammer and boots being rando
Random start location? I never use that one
one day ttyd will have a good rando
Forced goombario start, let him get his 25 minutes of gless fame in
Big chest shuffle, but not into the general item pool
I'll still enjoy whatever you decide to do. lol. RANDO!
i forgot you got the new settings
can you randomize your start location? O_O
i cant wait to try when upgrades are anywhere is out
'If I'm a fan of prologue, there's 100000''
so will you make a tracker option for glitched logic?
do you think starting with no partners will be possible in the future?
pretty sure that mess stuff up
starting with no partners just guarantees one would happen soon, anyways
Jade raven? useless. Bubble berry? Gimme dat
There aren't many of those though
yeah i was pretty sure that was the case
Lantern Ghost, Tutankoopa, Duplighosts, Final Bowser... am I missing any?
that is a very valid question.
all badges and partners unusable, except goombario 1 fp charge Prayge
Starting with goombario is basically like starting with no partner
that's my new favorite bombette re color.
You could also go to 5...
i'm just trying to imagine what's going on in toad's head
i have such a hard time getting in that pipe after cheating
Just now getting here. What happened to glitchless?
yeah i do too but i still have a hard time lol
Screw it and do rando? I like it!
That's almost go mode for 4, isn't it?
we should get the devs to replace slow go with 1 coin it will be more useful
Turn it into Attack FX F
Slow go is useful in chapter 3 if you're worried about waking the clubbas
I am doing incredible tonight ^_^ I planned and organized a my very first preschool graduation ceremony and it was tonight, and everything was absolutely perfect!
Oh and by the way' I told you that I smelled a PB yesterday! phanto274BLANKIES
The best part is my school age summer program ended today, the grad was today, so all the big things are over....now I can actually breathe and relax
No this is rando 100% Kappa
laki is behind the tree with the spear guy
Thank god chat was on the screen for that run
Is LP skip allowed in all cards? Since you don't ever touch the card
i don't think you actually picked up the seed
Don't forget to turn that badge on Kappa
so are panels only changed like that with panel logic?
you might need that feeling fine
dont forget the one single panel containing the last check you need for go mode
at least volcano won't be dipped just for panels
when glitched logic uses glitchless logic for fun
Laki is in the dizzy stomp chest
Laki in Shrink Stomp chest raysQ
Do shy guys just scale by 1hp per chapter?
You did see the pulse stone...
Do you have this trick enabled in logic?
Although I supposed it doesn't matter if you've seen Cake Mix
i wouldn't even do this with paracarry
Game expects you to beat the chapter glitchless
i'm almost ready for mario + rabbids sparks of hope. nearly done the dlc for kingdom battle
Game says no fun for you
Can you bombette push gourmet guy?
yo i accidentally hit verify run on your glitchless pb, just wanted to notify you of my mistake
this seed just doesn't want u to cheat
Mt. Rugged, Boo's Mansion or Volcano even
Is spook the same as a fright jar?
Mmm my favorite flavor star piece
can at least see the store in 3, yeah
What is your favorite chapter in rando?
fair amount of early upgrade blocks
Low-key I think Goombario is probably in the better half of partners for Lantern Ghost
Who needs a hammer upgrade when you can jump on everything
ultra hammer does speed up panel checks
Only goombario and bow can do multi hit
If you manage to get here without Bow or Watt, Goombario's probably the 3rd best for this fight
The odds of nothing being in prologue are pretty low tho
plus the room pass the 3 pipes
it's usually only 1 check i find in prologue that has something, and of course goomba king is that check sometimes
so what's your least favorite check to do? besides goomba king
Saving yoshis gives a few checks though
i rather do goomba king then the forest checks
You only have to save Red Yoshi for that check tho
oh, i thought kolorado was post 5
Yo is that thee Mr. Phantom5800?
Wasn't there a 3rd Fortress Key?
Wait I didn't notice Twink wasn't in that cutscene
I like that we got to see twink once before final
Just turn off shortened cutscenes Kappa
Throws controller because it was useless
No crashing through the floor today Sadge
so how about that snowmans gift
Wait what if you had to do Bow Skip to get Boo's Portrait monkaS
for a glitched seed, glitches haven't been big yet
we saving the yoshi's while we're here?
They could always be in Deep Jungle
hello :D been using the tracker, great work
when did you add the 3 letter thing to the tracker?
gatekeeping optimal tracking from us plebians smh
when you removing goombario off the tracker?
I've seen some of those... one of these days I'll work on that again lol
only 20 followers from your goal, gotta figure out that incentive!
auto tracker sounds like a nightmare to try to program
if i'm free sunday, i may think about that race
1 glundo day until sub 7
oh yeah the race on Sunday should i watch you or race hmmmm
i don't think i'd dnf, just possibly a 4 hour seed lol
One of these days I'll be able to play in a race again...
that's gonna depend on one of my friends, tho, cause we might be playing stardew
oh yeah i hate this trick now
i need to like actually practice this trick for randos its a weird feeling
im mainly bad at holding angles
if you land in the lower loading zone im guessing its just bad angles
beside that jump that trick doesn't look too bad
are you bombette pushing or something
i might try it next time i do a rando but with laki
did you ever find that laki clip for not needing parakarry at buzzar
I think I remember someone posting it
I randomly remembered today that I am getting my first tattoo on Monday
so i discovered a dk64 randomizer
Icarus flying with the words Break Free underneath on my left shoulder
You obviously need them for LP Kappa
glitched logic no cheating allowed phanto274Shrug hey the seed said it not me
Hello! How are you? Buy followers , viewers and primes on yourfollowz. com
i haven't had one of them bots in a loooooooong time
i have email verif on, and that's it
i prefer that twitch doesn't have my number
phone verif is definitely a bit much
just because of that I'm doing that everytime
Boo's Portrait deep in Crystal Palace YEP
I knew Fortress couldn't be empty considering how early you got 3 keys
Chapter 3 first gives you access to 6 and Snowmen
And Tubba's Castle is way faster than Crystal Palace
you gonna play more dark star this weekend?
Will the game expect you to break sewer blocks with boots?
For the one you'd be most interested in, you might be able to just jump from the pipe
2 might be last since pulse stone is late in logic but this is glitched logic so i don't know 100% how it work yet
no ive been trapped in a dorm for a week im rusty af
also how does one socialize with adults
Now you can full clear ruins WITHOUT glitches
are you sure this is glitched logic?
just level up fp and you can use it once
Does Prologue Jr even have defense?
Is it possible to glitch into the boss fight?
you can but you cant get the card
Makes sense. Didn't know if it was just hard or had technical issues.
pretty sure you cant leave the boss room either
i have to check the glitch video again
glitch logic or just bad seed?
i see you only have 3 keys though sassyv5Badboy
Yoooo how's it hangin jokehoMow just got off work.. logged 20,000 steps today Deadge
Beat 6, maybe the Palace Key is above the clouds Kappa
I suppose you can get that check w/o beating the chapter but you wouldn't have access to Rowf
Watch that be the Palace Key
You had too many Life Shrooms anyway
Kooper's Shell wasn't a trap, was it?
Wait why are there 2 chapter 2-scales?
Anoter inventory slot freed up COPIUM
Monstar. The most power thing in the universe
Looking forward to beating Bowser with 4 Fortress Keys in inventory
maybe if we get lucky you could try retrigger prologue
The Koopa Bros are in Bowser's Castle bc you stole all their keys and now they're locked out
Sometimes you have to waste Kooper's turn so you can bully the Duplighost
Well that's a middle finger to the face'
Let's hope Palace Key is here so you don't have to come back
It's extreme pain all over again phanto274Thonk
I took a break a while ago. I am done organizing my clothes that was in boxes so YAY progress
I still a lot to do but im happy with what i've done on my weekend cats4eWiggle
I go back to work tomorrow BabyRage
destiny 2 is dropping a new raid next Friday
yeah i hate it but i cant stop playing it
Do you have life shrooms left?
I know one of the Life Shrooms was in 7
I think they do base 2 at this scale
good question tbh i got nothing
im 100% buying a soccer ball there and going to the field at least once
ima bring two pro-cons my switch/laptop and elgato
Mailbag was super early in logic
it's battery span is like 2 hours
im just hoping there is a practice room
glitch is like 80% setups tho fourthgenKEK
That was super early in logic too papeHands
Even then, Parakarry was in Rowf's Shop after 1 chapter
3? I thought it was just 1
Did you get the Mt. Rugged panel?
There's also a couple loose checks in 6
caught somewhere inbetween having taco bell for dinner, or a bowl of cereal. adulthood
At least I think you did, let me check
i don't remember you feeding him
I don't remember you feeding him either
Just get good at Gusty Gulch skip so you never need him raysY
has the rando devolved into CBT?
someone need to fine a glitch to get this without paracarry
How much worse is it when compared to say, Mt. Rugged Bub-ulb?
Well, I should go to bed, good night
Don't tempt me with a good time
12min late, but not too late
so I got better... but I might also just picked up COVID... shrimpsGeraldS
when you get hit, it drains energy based on how much dmg it reduced
it burns through all your SP while you have some instead of taking dmg
an actual use for star power lol
imagine, it takes 8 turns to regen 1 bar of se for refresh
if you take 3 dmg, stellar shield reduces 1 dmg, means 1 turn worth of SE is drained
Stellar Shield kinda breaks the balance in early game
is that in the current build?
Stellar Power, you can get after parakarry
means, it drains 3 turns worth
man Stellar Flowers had a big history
when i remember general guy being 5er bounceable back then empero125Thamz
that's so cheap bro, boooooo, im leafing
Mon, did you know about this sus
you must tell shade to patch it
casually I just did stone cap and bomb
meh, probably intended for you to do
remember, using refresh removes the +FP
refresh itself works kinda weird, ngl
refund is actually good for once
selling boo leaf is actually one of the best grinding methods to get coins
you might wanna see what the soda item does
you see once you get it :)
did you go get power rush yet?
since it was spoiled you could have done an over reaction
surely just a few more leaves
i still need to finish another run to make sure my route changes are good lol
equipping any curse badge's also work like peekaboo
did you see what bombette and kooper have in super rank
most people seeing it for the first time, thought he did -1 ATK
added the desert coins (with instructions on how to do the bandit lure, shout-outs to nater) among others so the coin routing is a bit different but it should make things better overall, also added power plus in place of all or nothing in places where we have the bp to spare, namely on LP
nothing major but it should make things smoother
i remember maining power smash as a kid because i could never land the jump commands
action commands actually lining up with animations DansGame
repel can be good with double dip I guess
i still miss my power bounce sometimes
so shooting star the goomba king? empero125Thamz
i thought he did in this too
bruh, you played the game so many times and failed this LuL
it's not as bad as glass Joe beating you
he only has one goal and it's to go fast
at least he never lost to glass Joe
if this was in japanese youd nail it
im guiding him, yes, jump on oopa
the classic was always power bomb, even here in hardmode
i mean who doesn't like nuking
if the game gives me the option to nuke, i HAVE TO USE IT
Don't grow addicted to it LuL
oh don't worry, I'm enjoying the stream
I tought you were gonna say to follow and subscribe if we liked that content
subscribe with TWITCH PRIME; FREE MONEY Kappa
1 like = 1 goombario saved in a rando
goombario's final attack is actually good in dse though for real
yeah but everything has def in this game
the badge which needed to get nerfed 5 times
it's just a shroom, nothing to worry about empero125Thamz
read what the potato does LuL
we need hustle drinks in rando i know you can start with 1 with random items
without double dip, hustle drink is kinda irrelevant in rando imo
you could snow doll on pyro guys
You got game overed? How bad?
YOU didnt fight anti guy Kappa
how much did Bow get paid to do your dirty work?
you let a woman slap the heck out of anti guy empero125Thamz
Get the ingredients to make Lemon Candy
lemon candy should've made a harder version of the fight start
i really enjoy the new enemy placements
I never seen a gold koopatrol. What's the purpose?
I had a cheesesteak sandwhich with grilled onions yesterday, the cheesesteak was good but the onions made it eh
Lmao, u actually used thunder rage
should of made him recover 25 hp after that attack
i just skipped him for now
russ t can live without his book
I hope there's an evil Ultra Shroom fight
Honestly, this is my first time seeing a different edition to this
What kind of shy guys are those?
I know DSE has console issues but I never got this
Prony0 can you post it in dse chat?
i can't believe you blocked with partner
i always thought lg was exactly vanilla lol
I was gonna say this mod starting too look a little easier but never mind
Why is the block all the way up there? LUL
makes things more difficult, but isn't so cringe like MQ empero125Thamz
Your art looks familiar. Did OhDee make it?
i wonder if u need watt do even get that
ram an enemy with holding watt
Ah cool, yeah he's an irl friend and I thought I recognized the pfp
phanto274Awoo phanto274Hype phanto274Rage phanto274Sip phanto274Thonk phanto274Facepalm phanto274Love phanto274Gaming phanto274King phanto274Snake phanto274Pog phanto274Ball phanto274Mash
Mash I think is my favorite
btw I dont know if youll want to stay on console, shield badges like last stand crash on console
sounds great for a 5hp playthrough pepeW
I didn't need any of the shield badges and only switched to emu in the endgame
lacks a quite some console support, but ye, wonder if he changes his mind on working on that
i think that if you fix every bug on console, emu should run fine with no bugs
The problem is often with float operations, they can explode on console if you arent careful but emus are not accurate so are mostly fine
What did I miss? I had to put in the next bundle
stellar power uses 3/8 per hit, not attack
Anti-Guy in the Boss Fight. Makes sense
This is Dark Star after all
using it with hammer/power jump moves, it's ideal
definitely not good for such a long fight
Did you pick up the def plus
this game becomes more of a cooking sim the further you get
@Phantom5800 I see those ellipses in the Quick Change so I'm curious. What did they change? LUL
it will trigger every even turn 100% all the time
golden shroom + cake mix empero125Thamz phantom, do it
The Baby Toad's dream is coming true in Dark Star
hiii, sad that I had to miss so much of this AMAZING mod, but I had to reverse some stuff in pso, so how tragic has it been?
in a good or bad "I need to grind" way?
you know idk what to say about it so we'll leave it as that
when rowf can't make jump charge appear
how late do you think youre on for tonight
i have 5 hours to kill
im off for tonight to prepare everything
Time to try everything out and see if it works.
Why did that do so much damage?
Maybe Spin Dash will come in handy after all. Kappa
my dad just barged in and goes, Guess what? I got my first follower on youtube! Me: only 1? Kappa
@Axl_Sensei Axl, please. Don't crush his dreams. LUL
i know, you gotta start somewhere but wouldnt celebrate over 1
watt needed a nerf hardcore, 1st you still will use watt to pierce def and gives more reason not to use watt on 0 def enemies
fine chat! Ill make him a cake to celebrate!
shroom cakes stack, if you're scared of using it twice
i cant wait for 3 of these a tonce
if only we had some anti guy fight practice before this Kappa
hows the routing been going? Kappa
it works on all of em beside anti
you could use bombette spin smash
lullaby the stable guys apparently turns them into shy guys
i think it slept them for 3 turns?
Fun fact: you can make happy's trigger twice in one turn with hustle
how much hp does he have btw?
Power Shock is the way to go, I guess.
Unless it stacks like Bow's Outta Sight does
you can status them more then once
that same applies to anti guy
i wouldnt recommend trying to power shock anti guy twice
Don't mind me, just lurking about watching Unfair Paper Mario
if you status them once, -50% on all statuses
We haven't even gotten to General Guy yet. Kappa
did that say plus 0 attack
don't remember him doing so much while having stellar shield LUL
i think i ended up tanking a lifeshroom in my 5hp
Also, whoever gifted me a sub, thank you. <3
ig letters and see if you did all of quizmo up till now
you can get 6 from koots
lol, you can get enough from quizmo
21 star pieces in total, have all the answers written LUL
kinda wanted to do a rando, but its 7pm maybe tomorrow
do you drop exp in this?
drop exp is only a rando thing clover did
i think Thamz has made clover do this secretly smh
i really don't like losing xp in rando
rather, you lose time kinda by trying to runaway
ez money farming method unlocked :tf:
are full recoveries from lvl up's relevant in rando
i see Jcog drop HP to 5
in dse, you can drop your HP to 1
I'm so glad I started going danger
i dont remember the last time ive seen these shy guys
i actually forgot about the shyguys
Ok but when you beat this, do you do Luigi skip at the end?
only after ch4, you can get more star pieces after the luigi quest
the shyguy in the south shop cracked me up a bit
ahh, i mean after the merlee one
after ch4, you unlock 8 more question for quizmo
i love how i written that down
Whacka has had enough of being whacked.
final whacka is the true final boss
Whacka is the Grand Master. The Master in Toad Town goes to him for training
save you some trouble, 8 dmg
you kinda cheese Tubba with egg missiles itself
that was meant ffor discord KEKW
gonna need to fight goomba with goomba
Dare I ask, what's with the Pink Boo?
putting ch8 enemeies in ch3 what could go wrong
are these boos in the village friendly? cuz there are a lot more of them than I remember
why's there a sign in front of Tast T's?
No EXP for beating the grunts? bleh
just wait until the third anti guy Kappa
reloaded thr stream just for that lol
thought my stream froze then I saw your eyes just shift back and forth animej1Char
Heard the music, but saw the game froze
WE ARE STILL ON THIS OMG
it might be because of the smokes it makes when triggering
iirc i think shade didn't know how to fix it
Mod creators....I think we discovered a bug
yeah but what if they made it crash on purpose to teach you a lesson?
probably something about the console not able to let the smole cloud smokes appear
"It's not a bug, it's a feature!"
i could check the speed run i know he use 5 hp for the whole game
literally just got here, I'unno wot's going on
cook a potato with fire flower to make frozen fries and use nutty cake to negate the -Atk, all you need to know :O
what's the closest you got to killing him?
20/50 in like 2-3 hours....oh boy
I mean, i used POwer bounce LUL
simply reset completely and grab power rush
nerfed power bounce might be useful in these trying times!
+1 dmg for the first strike
what if they lied and power bounce is good?
with turbo charge, 10 dmg for 6 fp /if Anti Guy is not paralyzed
if you use a nutty cake, even with para you deal 10 dmg for 6 fp
2 +PP +1 fs modifier +Turbo +item boost
or buy jump charge and stall until mario has +6
good thing, if you have jump charge stacks, using hammer won't remove it
used lullaby a lot to stall
i think 1 turn pass once when u and partner take turns
basically 3 turns of +1 atk kinda
Am I imagining things or did power bounce's 2nd hit go from 6 to 4?
This really is Unfair Paper Mario
Anti Guy doesn't jump a 2nd time when you have electrify
he does it when his on low health
Oh, I thought it did 20 on block
stone cap won't help you much
cuz it's only +9 def LuL
oh yeah stone cap is only plus 8 def
Oh neat. Someone gifted me a sub.
has someone done a walkthrough of this so you can know what was the solution?
meaning the emu sucks but we knew that already
Shrink is your best bet after paralyze imo
tbh idk but I would NOT have fun to solve this one
nerfed power bounce helps us in these trying times!
Boy would Mega Rush be great right now
in this mod? actually would shock me
We're figuring it out bit by bit
I'd rage quit so hard lol
I'm probably not gonna stick around the whole run/stream, for once. I wanna go keep watching the new episodes of Locke & Key.
it is not based on anything though, yes I will be pandentic on this slang being weird
only useful if he does his massive attack
Locke & Key has baited me in with cliff hangers and intrigue, and I'm hooked, much to my dismay.
one way would be to stall stack jump charges tbh, you can jump charge buy it in rowf shop rn
ooo ill have to check it out
oh sheet theres an antiguy just chillin right there
he is chilling, until he has a turn
We need at least one life shroom
did you get all the 3 lifeshrooms in dry dry desert?
lifeshrooms are an unlimited resource in this
idk about the cooking but they are
2 choices: Mystery cooking into a lifeshroom or get one where runway pay was in vanilla
mq and dse, lifeshroom recipe > sweet shroom, in dse you can cook one with mystery
iirc you can also get a lifeshrom when beating goomba king EX a 2nd time
he doesn't do a lot of dmg iirc
does shroom cake work that way normally?
his main dmg source is the bulb, when that's gone, he won't deal more then 4 dmg
so the real boss was anti guy all along
it felt so wrong leaving the library in 2nd peach cutscene
Dark star soap cake % when?
Soap Cake reminds me of those Chills Top 15s
use only cleanser for the cake
I want my pizza to be done already
yes, you will need to beat them someday
the 30s timer is now frame perfect
replace every item you need to put in, for cleanser
get your phone and set the timer
when i played this when i was a kid i put the strawberries on before the cream and theres a different sprite for it and it was wrong
why do i feel like you need put one strawberry
Maybe you used the wrong cleanser
ig it only works for the 1st and 2nd step
i wanna see peach sneaking by the super fast dark koopatrolls with the cake in hand
You need to buy all his badge's after ch6
Woah it's not Sunday, we fight LP today?
1st, acts like a power jump
2nd, you don't need ice power, it deals ice dmg
3rd, is basically chill out, but -2 instead of 3
also you can hit electrified enemies with it
Oh, that's your HP going away
is the minus health cuz of the whale's stomach acid?
Bit early for a peril manip
Also, he's digging into the whale's body. WutFace
i see also not much logic why it works twice
does being paralyzed give them defence?
i mean, his a joke boss
Dumb question' what's the difference between dark star and master quest?
the camo guy can take away your abilities
can fuzzipede take away your 3 item/jump/hammer ability?
like spy guy, when he attacks you, you lose one ability?
if he hammers you and you dont blovk
I don't remember this in vanilla
sushi is a really wear name for a fish
was he there the whole time?
the "then" make me think if everyone dies then you still win
dunno, i want it removed but he didn't wanted to
one jump is enough to kill it iirc, it has 4 HP LUL
At least you don't have to get sushie
that is a reason, why you tattle
Have you seen the bee movie? They fly fast. Might've dodged some stars
You get to be a hero... twice!
also 7, you have to deal exactly the dmg equal to it's current health
i mean, the tattle says it
think it like that, tattle wants you to think like that, to make you suffer and say, told you so empero125Thamz
i assume it was auto selecting the partner for the area i never noticed it elsewhere
Looked away, did you get star piece in water?
quick jump, more like late jump
you can tell poison breath vs chomp by how far away from you they stop
I can't wait for the 4 plant and 2 magikoopa fight
which plnats? i don't know any empero125Thamz
they're slightly further away when theyre doing poison breath
What if he got more hp when he transformed?
boo leaf saves the day again
Also getting that juicy xp before LP
Leaf and mystery for a possible repel gel?
Can you give a mistake to the yoshi?
"do it coward. ice won't give me 90 seconds of literally just need twice the D"
So, there was a food place by me in college called D.P. Dough, and they gave out stickers that said exactly what you think they did.
no way you get into the volcano today
unless you stream 3h more hours i think
Do' do tattles not take his turn in vanilla?
you won't get past the U stone that easy :P
Oh ok thank god. Didn't actually black out when playing as a kid
better then Jelly Ultra, if cooked
Concussions haven't been tooo bad yet
is that what i think it is
whenever I'm dizzy, I also rub my face on a pole repeatedly
Qutta sight won't help you empero125Thamz
Jade Jungle doesn't play any games
chill out can help since his attack his multi hit
I'd say his rly difficult, even for my standards
Farming coconuts for Life Shrooms. Smart
that strawberry is legit the item from ch4 peach intermission
with some prep this fight is actually free
spotify just rick rolled me !!!!
Why would you assume cutscenes are a safe space in DSE
Can't wait for it to respawn and get you
It's a creative way to force a fight
So this is Anti Guy if he knew Guerilla Tactics
So... Stone Cap got nerfed. LUL
does chill out stack with frigid stomp?
Was fine except for the bow woopsie
i just did a variant of the boo leaf strat lmao
That was pretty PogChamp of him to throw like that.
It's Dark Star. I wouldn't be surprised.
the satisfied feeling of beating an obstacle
too hard :P -he answered for fixing shield issue
he jumps into lava himself multimple times
Also what all do you need me to bring setup wise for our room at 2dcon
I asked him and he said ask you LMAO
Cause I can bring my good large one
Yea it might be best to bring more than less then
Mega Bonk 10 Dmg 8 fp
basically mega jump, doesn't pierce def
Multibonk too op for CK and hallway JR
that looked like a scripted fight for a sec
Mega Bolt does 7 dmg for 7 fp btw, which i probably guess you upgrade either bow or watt
Been lurking but only 2 deaths so far in chp 5? Legit!
You should've seen it faster lmao
That spike top sure is in a diff spot
Shrink Bomb is the worst move
4 dmg to all enemies +shrink
Tidal Wave costs 9 fp and dmg is vanilla, so start cycle smashing LUL
I usually get 7 without the mash
Bow Curse can weaken also elemental weaknesses
Lava Piranha. It's time to see how OP they are.
it's not something it was supposely do
7 inputs on water weak enemies, to make it worth the cost
also Sushi causes chill out for 1 turn with -1 atk
that will be not the first time you will WANT to refresh
cause what's coming next will not be your liking
refresh very good in this fight
-3 def per turn, doesnt stay down, double block action command
At least the Buds stay down
getting the partner block is absolutely vital lol
do you have dodge master equipped
you need Snow Dolls and probably hustle/mini sodas
to you getting obliterated by LP
Now you get to walk all the way out :)
youre close to level up if that helps
dunno if it's unpiercable def when both buds are out
does lp second phase have def
wait i forgor its on fire too
learn tidal wave mash cycle to beat LP
yeah it takes a lot of practice to get good at, and even then its a bit rng
Is Water Block good in this game?
1 fp tidal wave next rando
I've had my fair share of 14 damage tidal waves
what the hell did you do?
but what did you for the ch4 one?
ice/water dmg attacks removes the fire they have
how was the one in ch5 btw?
Double Dip is coming in clutch right now
7 TURNS WTF IS WRONG WITH HIM?
AND NOW 2 ANTI GUY APPEARS!
Now go back up and skip him anyway
officially further than ive made it HYPERCLAP
This fight took me a long time but I didn't realise refresh removed stats debuffs at the time
You will need to grind a lot of coins offscreen to buy out Rowf probably
so I just add to rush LP like a madman and block every attack
Mega Quake is buyable after ch5
will the game kill you before you get to save though??
there are good grind setups with curse badges in ch6
You might need to buy mega quake though
and ya need coins for that
sway is on pape with RAC splits open PauseFish
OMG ARE THEY GOING TO CHANGE THE QUESTIONS?
And they certainly are on patrol
Plot Twist: You have to get all the questions right
was the anti guy in ch5 hard?
if you need coins btw, yellow yoshi gives golden melons in DSE
so 500coins for a batch of fried shrooms
2 attempts? Not bad at all
Sway walked up and did bhs on 2nd try lol
When was the last time he played 64
What am I gonna do for the rest of the night now
Sway is gonna show a nice rac Flushed
Golden melons give 75 coins each
also you can cook the OP item in the game with it, one of the best
you can give that yellow yoshi fried shrooms
oh wait, you have an entire week need to work right?
Do whatever sounds most fun!! (But I love glitchless lol)
This emote is great for mobile viewers
im boutta leave for the fgc weekly
I have the week off. Ive spent all day in bed so far lol
im good, gonna fire up a rando seed soon. I need to play something other than colonel LUL
I woke up an hour ago so I feel that
i think i got to sleep around 6
If I didn't work I don't think I would ever sleep before 3am
I didnt make the tier list, Im in a league of my own I suppose jokehoDespair
i was dead whenever the tier list started so it wasnt that thorough lol
I went to bed at 3am, was too excited to sleep
You seemed tired af lol XD
So the fuzzies gave you a trap, and then theyre like oh actually we want it back???
Idk when I'm getting there on thursday
I'm bugging jibca about it tonight
I work until 2pm so like 5 at the earliest probably
i'm already on the report streamer page
Is that only on the dev branch?
it'll get pushed as is next release, to get a lot more feedback
Ok time to be gone till midnight have fun with prologue
Thx phantom nice of you to say <3
midwest speedfest? where in the midwest clintT
i dont count Minnesota as midwest so that name is inaccurate :)
too north mid to be true mid
Everything is so far from me cats4eFine colorado speedfest when
Yeah that's ass BabyRage time to start saving for when I wanna go meet speedfrens
washington is literally farther than minnesota
items tossed by NPCs or chests due to full inventory should never despawn
AYO? We need some organizers to hop on it. Colorado is awesome and CENTRAL
I got some friends in colorado I could make go to that speedfest. Plus colorado i've heard is actually kinda nice
Yeah they live there for..... uh.... legal reasons
i look on google maps and washington is 1,300 miles away and minnesota is 900 some miles away
Willis from digimon the movie is from Colorado
Louisiana to Colorado is 1200 miles tghSad
Why is the united states so big clintB I wanna see muh frens
I just hate living in the south, I don't ever get to see my friends cause they all live in places better than me
I sweat opening my front door
oh god I cant handle humidity
PLEASE COME REMOVE ME FROM THIS LIFE
has PhantoBot say anything unusual yet?
Oh phantom did you watch the seed I had
It's so nice and dry here. I would send you some dryness if i could cats4eSad
Where I had to hit the block 10 times....
It had 2 required key items
It was my first ever hammerless
@PerMitzi I have no idea what anything lower than 70% humidity D:
I was at work I missed it clintB
if you live in Louisiana for longer than a year you develop gills
I think if you are used to humidity the dryness can be pretty jarring clintT oh and the elevation.
Im always altitude training cats4eWiggle muh whole life
I mean, when I went to Minnesota for SGDQ
@Phantom5800 M O I S T
When I went to florida I got heat rash really bad
i am unable and unwilling to adapt to humidity
If you aren't used to it, it's really hard to adapt too
mail this back to me in a week
I feel like no one adapts to humidity, you just accept a life of suffering LUL
I've had to accept it since the day I was born iceblueSad
never knew that was a problem
Some of us didnt have a choice
I was lucky to spawn in colorado shoosh4Hypers
i did not know this clintNotes
i now have a bot in my channel that does that
tell your bot not to come hang out in my chat
my entire community is horny posting
I can't wait for the bot to eventually say sNeed
I can't wait for the bot to eventually say NFT
write two sentences using the word sNeed Ohrocks
I made a commitment to say sNeed instead of seed cause I think it's funnier. stickshamRiku1a stickshamRiku1b
do it standing on one leg too
just like 3 rooms over lol
phantom did you see the watermelon explode last night
that shit went on my ceiling
they were locked up for using the word sNeed instead of sNeed.
It slow exploded at first but then oh my
there is but im on mobile
do i need permission to post links clintT
isn't there a buy follows command?
wanna become F A M O U S?
so glad i haven't seen one of those in forever
no no.... i don't think i will do that
I don't ever want to mount any viewers
I feel like if I went to mount viewers dot com, I'd be introduced to some weird fetishes
damn there's no prime shill command
Koopa bros fortress was actually useful this time! phanto274BLANKIES
you have time to make slots but no prime?
what are the slots for, anyways
for midwest will there be a goombario bidwar?
oh yeah, how was dark star on saturday?
it's fuzzies but available at the push of some keys on a keyboard.
so dark star rando when? jk
just don't crash using it stickshamGaslight
more def at the cost of your save
is this normal or glitched logic?
when is the all glitched logic run
I turned of x because I dont want to do x lol
is raph skip one of the glitch u can turn on?
make kolorado always spawn getting beat up
i didn't even know about getting soft locked there until u told us
why is that your response to DFW?
that shop is the definition of "you've got mail"
that just gave me an idea
walk into a pawn and try to sell your mail LMAO
why would you want to fight anything in a Paper Mario game?
is double DOUBLEWEED an emote here?
as long as we can avoid super
whenever I do coinsanity I forget the two coins on that flower fan thingy by the whale
what did i miss my internet crash
just need to find that sparky gal
do we know when full gear shuffle hits public?
sadge, i really wanna try it
the next public release is gonna be huge
im so excited to not have to bug phantom for seeds
I would do full gear shuffle if there was a setting where you could guarantee the big chests had progression items
i prefer the full random tbh
routing toward big chests feels less rando to me
I was thinking about a way to do it--do a full rando and then swap items in the same sphere as the big chests
phantom calls my idea naive: BibleThump
i'm waiting for the off chance, like the super minimal chance, that some how everything is vanilla
is it even possible to spin jump on these guys in overworld
i always miss with ultra boots when im standing on top of them
when I have gotten first strike with tornado jump, its felt like I landed on the ground and then did another little hop that landed on the enemy, but it counted as a tornado first strike
Hey Phantom, what emulator are you playing on?
I dont think I've had a seed yet where power bomb, mega bomb, and the quake badges were all expensive
don't use project 64 like me
how do you play a rando on console?
the ever drive is emulating a cartridge
you can watch spongebob on everdrive
you can watch spongebob in a gif
everdrive is basically the equivalent of a writable dvd, but for cartridge consoles
which everdrive do you have for n64?
so you cant just turn it off?
actually, an everdrive would be great for oot rando too
like if you are doing pape rando, you can reload an in game save from a game over just fine. Its when you actually power it off. I say this as someone with the X5
could probably do the same with MM rando
I got my expansion pak with dk64 back in the day
does oot rando work fully on ED?
ive always heard altering sounds on console is hard
i got an expansion from ebay for 40 bucks, and it didnt work for me. I got impacient and went to a retro game store and spend 65 on one that did work.
everyone i know that do oot rando use wii
mm rando adding other game music is so sick
I thought about getting the snes, but honestly therre isnt much im interested to play on it
phantom is begging to get mugged Kappa
i havve physical versions of emerald and fire red
I still have the box for emerald
fire red was more of a gift, fren let me borrow it. Went to return it cause I was moving and he let me just keep it
dont they specify emu and version of it?
isnt there some slight differences in loads being slower or something
the real cartage is allowed right?
how can they prove everdrive vs original cart anyway?
but you just said everyhing is exactly identical
Are you nervous about the coming event?
timing from power on console, yeah?
pape is banned from running everdrive too
the muscle memory i had for sm64 messed with my pape runs starting
id hit start on my splits and reset my console at the file select lol
emu runs as well or just everdrive?
more accessibility would be great for this game
if emu is allowed it would be hidden by default or separated somehow
change "all" to "all consoles" -> profit
uhm actually emulator is allowed in my definition of the leaderboards, so i'll just improvise it
honestly im indifferent but id kinda be down with star rod
star rod timing for hundo would be great for verification i agree
star rod is still arms, just different arms
yeah we usually do something like that
I don't even speed run but i agree on star rod timing
the people who come out to these discussions
fine ill turn notifications on for it
it's like that meme of Patrick saying, "who are you people!?"
"I don't care about the topic and have never run, but my opinion is the most important."
Mario HATES pocket watches. ESPECIALLY if they stop time.
oh you already killed him nvm
thats quite a mouthful of a name!
my favorite speedrunner is named Tacoguyy! (it's spelled with two 'Y's, remember that) Tacoguyy is a pretty cool guy cause he posts weedMario and that's really based of him to do although I wished he posted more weedLuigi from time to time... what does have to do with speedrunning? Nothing at all! :^)
so youre going to show it off now right
imagine doing lpoob instead of lpib
can we just keep saying lpoob tho
know15: can we just keep saying lpoob tho
Starry_Arie: know15: can we just keep saying lpoob tho
god i love all the new palettes
i'm currently testing out doing oot rando on wii
Bubblegum Watt is one of my favorites. LUL
way better than the orange one
Is it possible to do rando on the switch?
Everything is going according to plan. Kappa
nice theres no bonus anti guy here
Dodge Master increases your cap range?
holy crap, it's a process to set up
but at least once i have everything ready, it takes like 2 minutes
The star spirit song makes me so sleepy
hiii so my pso tas map rng stuff is going very well, possibly will be ready soon too!
been learning unit testing and github actions too
also I used rider for the first time in a project, it's INSANE, this IDE is like it brings tears to my eyes
like I wanted to put csv files to have test data THE THING HAS A BUILT IN CSV EDITOR WITH FORMAT OPTIONS THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THE FILE FORMAT CORRECTLY!
there's so much more like an interactive rebase UI that's actually better than the cli way, the suggestions are AMAZING I am learning about fancy C# stuff
like if you ever asked is it worth to pay this much, IT IS
I see we're on dev; what options are you using?
this is very likely blue key required seed
there was a magical seed behind blue door
red key behind master 3 monkaW
TIL my school partnered with epic games to give us gaming pcs
there was a magical seed in the cavern ourside on mirror
Yo let me enroll there real quick
i know what the thing is i think
go jump on some spikes for a bit
My ears perked up for a sec then I was like oh other J lmao
But glad to see some rando!
are you excited for your run in Minnesota?
You didn't save the Yoshis? :(
are you gonna do a all sanity seed soon?
are you on bp pace you think?
it was a great seed last night
been so long since i did a seed myself
Just make all the bosses lv. 7. Easy fix. You'll never have to worry about XP again. LUL
does he transform based on turn count or
has koopa village legalized public nudity?
i guess after the fuzzy incident, they got over it
I support Kooper in his new life choice. <3
No, your 1 star point. :(
Sell your life shrooms. You'll have plenty of money. Kappa
gonna start referring to emulators as "the laptop" now
wtf is the weight doing there?! l0l
Would Fire Shield over Charge help at all?
I guess you could say you got a lot of "weight" on your shoulders fighting Bowser.
how does it work on jp?
us EN folks always getting the nerfed fights
Def only goes up by 3?
can't even blame Square on this one. Final Fantasy USA (Mystic Quest) anyone?
no lies, Mystic Quest was actually my first exposure to the Final Fantasy series
I still remember the boss theme very well
and treants performing Full Nelson on me
same for me and ebay because...very long story with my life lol
if it was in 2010 you can say you were investing
I still have my SNES and not even NOA Repair can fix it :(
im still waiting on the day i go to a garage sale and stumble on a box of games
"yo dawg, you got the stuff?"
find a bug fables CE 0_o
Meeting at Target? A very well-lit place? Nah, too shady. Let's go behind the alleyway instead. LUL
it's a good thing we don't have targets here then!
I blocked lightning one time in my life. LUL
@ScrambledDragons yeah, me too. on the first time I beat this game only.
will i remember what it is or be completely clueless? idk!
@Tio_Marshal The one other time I realized he was doing it, I didn't block it and I died. LUL
took a while to realise it
now you can boot up fp on wii and show everyone the super cool fire flower crash Kappa
ttyd does not have this sadly :(
don't mind us, we just jammin
run the same one back for a sub 230
27483 isn't getting any votes. :(
I said 27, and voted for 24. l0l
This is where the chat divides
i can be the tiebreaker :)
looks like you'll just have to do them both
my dog wants to vote too
alright just pause the poll i'll login to my 4 alt accounts
my entire family of 9 wants to vote
@Official_Vladimir_Lenin 2 vote 161 and the other 2 248. Kappa
At this point, do a coin flip. LUL
i like the powers of 2 at the begining of 24856
but 16167 has the nice repeated 16's
If only there was a 16 somewhere. Oh wait
You can't really sing from a cookbook. LUL
An Ultra AND a Jelly! PogChamp
yall wanna see a puppy picture of my dog from 2010
kali is worth the time loss
he look like he seen a ghost oh wait
oh yo idk if it got back to you om sure you're aware
but the tracker needs to be updated from the last time I used it like a week ago that it always assumes progressive blocks
oh np take your Time just making sure you're aware
you're volunteers I just appreciate you do any of this at all xoparLove
how many checks in cheeto are worth doing usually
I always get em all cuz I start with 999 if I'm doing a solo seed cuz fuck coin management KEKW
oh you doing a glitchy glitch or is he moved
how free is this stuff cuz honestly I don't wanna put a ton of time learning tricks but I'm willing to put in some
I do odd key early and super hammer without parakerry and that's about it
Who need physics when you can ride a cloud?
only thing i haven't tired is early toy box and store room
Is there a rando for TTYD?
I should continue playing that game
Ima play it I have it physically lol
like the loading zine could be fun thinking like oot beta quest but idk if that works for ttyd
I kinda wanna play vanilla again it's been several years just to find out where all the vanilla shit is LUL
I was gonna pick it up like a couple years back
but I was told wii vc was ass and I didn't have access to another version
I was told tricks were really different
yeah it was English cuz i actually legally bought it in the wii shop WAY back in the day
I mean I wasn't going for a competitive time I learn runs for fun and my own self satisfaction
best badge in the game right there
oh more glitchy glitches idk about I see swifPout
oh fuck it's that easy LUL
I'm getting the sense you need him for a lot of shit
Ohrocks calls seeds "sNeeds" and wanted the bot to say it lmao
good thing you got fire shield
you have hammer and boots rando?
i think the slight notch push really helped me for this
But you can already skip all of those keys
I was gonna say, why you saving the Thunder Bolt
Zap Tap blocked by Electro Blooper is slightly funny
And that's why it was sub 3. LUL
well this is the first time it registered in muh brain
i was afk doing chores and stuffs
That was quite the stash. Kappa
Most of them being star pieces
the new settings make star pieces more valuable potentially
you could need up to 60 it seems?
did you go to merlow this seed already? i dipped for a bit
i hope that cake doesnt hurt me later on in my shift cats4eWiggle
I want ice cream really bad, but my tummy won't like me because I'm lactose intolerant
i mean... that doesnt stop most people
Don't leave Bow behind this time
this is true. because I'm still going to have ice cream.
only 69,405,000 tokens until elite smash you better get warmed up
Also wow this room is stacked
In the mountainous desert of all places
Every check in that room a key item?
can we pool our channel points to get to the smash goal faster?
Keep in mind that one room had more stuff than Merlow did.
I'm saving my channel points. Kappa
I think everyone is saving for 30k lol
Vanilla and lime doesn't go well together >_<
that or 75k I just don't know what game you wouldn't mind playing casual. ya know?
@grudge_maxx Not with that attitude. LUL
Moustafa thanks you for the dried shroom and dusty hammer. They're his favorite things to eat. Kappa
what about a casual play through of this game? just chillin, no speed run? probably be quite the challenge for you. lol
What do you mean? This is casual. Kappa
sorry I'm so slow with my typing/responses. I watch on my phone. my computer took a shit.
How did Tayce T's frying pan end up in the desert?
I just noticed we have dusty bombette
Inb4 Ch. 4 is scaled to Lv. 7
you don't have the cake to feed big boi!!
Hello! jcogWave how's the rando so far?
I dont play with traps cuz I get too attached to items once i see them
see if i play with traps... even if i know it's a trap imma run into it cause what if it isnt Kappa
i think there needs to be a setting beyond plenty
"anything thats no progression is a trap"
that'd actually be kinda interesting exactly one time
You can never trust a coin block ever again.
Oops, all traps + Glitch logic
alright it's off to work i go. Best of luck with the sneed
I'm now eating ice cream. rip my tummy.
what NO im a lover not a fighter
you should make a channel point redeem thingy to play the slot machine
50k to save yoshi kids next rando
that would be annoying if someone redeemed it while you're at Crystal palace or something and you have to go all the way here. lol
btw. this ice cream is bomb.
a vanilla drumstick with the nuts on top.
unfortunately not this one. but those are really good too.
it's in the freezer. so yes. next time.
I usually only have ice cream when I go over to my friend's house and he gets drunk enough to order ice cream from the nearby bodega
l0l. that just sounds like something I'd do when I'm drunk. lmao
i might learn the shop clip but not how to get out tbh
i took a break earlier to do other stuff, but i got oot rando to work on the wii!
less resources for my pc to worry about
i mean, for now i'll still do the one i already have on emu, but next ones will be through wii
the hardest part was figuring out how the wad manager thing works
and which manager would actually work
didnt even have to pay 50k EZ
Why'd you say my name backwards? Kappa
also, loving the ice mario look
Don't ever take Kooper for granted.
after watching Rick n morty, I say "take for granite" lol
trying to see what other randos i can do on wii besides oot and mm
He can hear colors? Bot, what are you smoking?
me when i hear green ICANT
Sends all the speedrunners running for the hills.
I GOT MY TATTOO! I have to wait to show it off though
Make sure tohit that box, it looks sus
Ultra Stone in the Koopa Bros Fortress. LUL
I got one from Raph once
I'm curious, do you actually think it's faster to follow the trap block as opposed to just blowing up the wall from outside?
So they originally scheduled me to host for Pape Glitchless but I couldn't because of work but I would have totally done so
I usually do them in a different order, so Bombette, Pit, Refund
Does anyone here use retrotink? I'm looking at getting one
why retrotink vs an RCA to HDMI converter
Blowing up the wall outside saves some cutscene time
God, the tattoo feels like a sunburn
i love how bombette walks backwards
At least we get to hear one of the best songs for a while
I thought you had green blue orange yellow
koopa colors is my favorite part phanto274Hype
Hello!! I found your VODS on YouTube and have been binge watching them. You got me into finally playing PM rando
You can go with either Paige or Mae haha
that's how i know about it
its because i watched you do it before... =P
ive never seen this be good but i always check it
and you cant go below the wood boards
dude I am learning github actions, this thing is amazing, why have I been doing my builds manually like a caveman?
i haven't gotten a haircut since 2020
i shaved my head in march 2020
with shaving cream and a razor
but since its not replinishable its technically not in logic?
Bombette been greedy af about FP lately
and magical seed would mean your trek to shiver mountain wasnt in vain
A big ass dragon at a bunch of people so I beat him up
now you can beat ch5 :)
I think github actions is like I am spending a ton of time rn to setup the file, but once I do I litterally pluck it in any projects and never think about it!
Is there a way to move faster(like the spin thing in this game)in TTYD
How do the bot quotes even work
Hey hey! Just finished my first Glitchless run :D
Yeah, I just died in Ch 5 three times so I had to do Cake Peach Scene like 4 times lmaoo
Well I just suck lol mine was laround 8 phanto274Shrug
Yeah, I just need to get lucky and gold every spit lol
did you follow a route or just wing it
also lp sucks on switch ;-;
I used the google doc route
Got to put the baby down. Gl bro catch you next time
Oh really? Ok i gotta do that then
and people are paying 50 bucks a year for that Kappa
you have goombario but not watt? thats crazyyyy
could always be a goombario trap
is that a unique sprite?? haha
can we get that as an emote
it is a ghost after all
but technically you shouldnt have the ruins key still!
super blooper probably has another ruins key
the one you got from gourmet guy
you got a cake from goombella
is that normal health for blooper at that stage? seems like a lot
also just noticed we're ice mario
super boots behind super blooper it just makes sense
Just like Zap Tap was behind Electro Blooper!
Was there something important in Prologue?
Wanna become famous? Buy viewers, followers and primes on viewers. shop (viewers. shop)
damn I was too slow to ban
Mr Hero was a gamer, they probably could've stayed
@1STSTAR__ you wanna join mr hero
But this man jumped into thin air and landed in the ruins
Mr Hero Gamer is a real one
the loading zone is just always there
can you jump into the air and go into ruins? I don't think so buckO!
you can use ultra boots or laki to get up there
Did you see the spin setup I found?
oh, I thought ive seen you do it
dude it's so cool to see your thing being cross built on 3 platforms and having the zips immediately!
like the same way you get up on to the bubble berry platofrm
It gives 2 extra frames to make the jump if you find the timing hard
my bad, thought i saw you do it
ohhh im talking about getting into the ruins, not ruins jumo
If you have numerical values for that, I might want to see at some point to see how your notch compares with my stats
Did you do Crystal Palace already?
the ultra boots block on shiver mountain is a badge
i can make you speedrun a new game soon lmao
you should make him speedrun bug fables
I'm like halfway to 30k already
I'd be closer if I was subbed, and didn't blow most of it on Good RNG
ive lost all my points a couple times
you're saying I could've refunded myself for all that Good RNG?
is the onc check inchapter 3 faster?
did you sleep at the inn
You did go back for the Sushie room stuff, Boo's Portrait was there
Aight done with homework, what I miss
Magical Seed is best case, Lunar Stone or Tubba Key probably means Rowf
And Scarf means Snowmen I guess
you have to upload this gross seed to youtube
kooper, seed, key, lunar stone, and palace key all at the inn
(I dont know what this does)
I don't know how that's even possible
Oh does the scarf open up the castle
i remember being so confused about the inn checks when i started randos
i thought you had to sleep 3 times or something to spawn the extra items
You can now go to chapter 6 lol
The snowman had it the entire time
I will convert everyone to say sNeed and drink Baja Blast
And now you beat 6 and get go mode YEP
so sNeed can refer to both a magical seed and a rando seed?
What are the odds you DON'T find everything you need here?
still the one check in ch3
I JUST WANT SOMETHING IN CLOUDY CLIMB
I had Weight in Cloudy Climb once before Big Chest Shuffle, that was fun
By a couple you mean a kooper
Good thing you did moles monkaS
Also lol Yellow Berry right there
Is that a tubba castle key
We dont talk about the blue key
why would you think I'm a Rando Randy sNeed?
yo phantom i've seen you on YT, cool to finally catch a stream live
This seed loves making you backtrack, huh?
true but 3 wouldn't be enough
My 6th period teacher just told me via a class discord that he plays smash and asked me why I play rosa
too many. you need an even number of lobsters so each one has a budy
is there a point to talking to the sun
Ive seen some really bad conditions in lobster tanks where theyre stacked on top of each other like 5 deep =(
does the flying turtle have the ground turtle
PhantoBot is still trying to learn to make a sentence that actually makes sense.
@buff00n I was planning on timing him out lol
talking to the sun triggers laki fight
Since you're Ice Mario, you have to at least equip Ice Power to make it official. Kappa @Phantom5800
Let's hope you don't find 4th Ruins Key after beating 2
4th ruins key in kolorodo tree
Also why is kolo's dead dad in hooktails castle
inching closer and closer to 500 followers!
On the bright side youre almost at 500 followers!
You guys read my mind lol
Huff N' Puff was definitely just full of air this seed
phantom i found a seed lmfao
on only my 2nd try today
All we need is one more key.
definitely worth watching the vod later
that's definitely a different kind of funny
no fighting bowser until my guy goombario is found
I looked away for a couple mins and now you got kooper lol where was he?
like the valiant hero he is
@1STSTAR__ a little fear's good for the lad.
show 'em what an adventure's like
I think yellow luigi is the best luigi color
when's Luigi gonna be a party member
the red luigi palette makes me uncomfortable
red luigi and green mario in the same seed
"Mario vs Luigi" PRETTY sure there's a romhack about that
SPM but not until like Chapter 7 OMEGALUL
Luigi will be a partner in 7 years of Paper 64's release
Fire Flower in the Ice Palace? Someone was trying to stay warm.
lol "is that go mode? what is even happening"
It's a shame you have to wait until chapter 7 to fight Luigi
at least you can warm up with the mystery Mr. L
play SPM everyone, it's the last "good" paper mario
it means you can kinda murder someone
I'd argue Origami King is "good"
we dont talk about sticker star
you mean you don't like fighting colored pencils???
again, I'd love the new Paper Mario's if they removed the battle system
No one's played Color Splash bc it's on Wii U so hardly anyone has valid opinions (I haven't played it either)
lemme jump and bop stuff with my hammer
I still remember the moment I jumped on a goomba in SPM and it didnt start an RPG battle and I was devastated
i remember getting spm for christmas and my parents were pissed when i told them i beat it two days later
By that do you mean not at all
I don't remember what I thought, but I liked SPM
im so close to playing through it again
I remember running through the 2nd pit of 100 trials, praying for a level up to refill my hp
I played SPM twice bc my file got pseudo-softlocked in Chapter 8
I would have liked it a lot more if my expectations of the genre werent set by 64 and ttyd, but its a great game
Color Splash and Origami King aren't bad, but they just aren't games I can get into.
pit music has no reason being that good
not good at the parts of Paper Mario games that people like
It's not about the art style, it's honestly about the gameplay for me.
as a kid i struggled with this boss because i had no idea wtf i was doing lol
Color splash and Origami king look incredible IMO
seeing you kill him before he can even attack makes me cry
I love art-style. I'm not a fan of how they decided there can't be unique characters
my 7 year old self could not for the life of me figure out lantern ghost. I just kept. Attacking. The. Lantern.
@OhDeeTV that was huff n puff for me lmao
we will never get another rogueport
Some higher up said "There's not enough Toads" and now there's nothing but male toads. LUL
the fact that toad town is over 20 years old and still a clear top 2 hub world says a lot
toads are just easier and cheaper, cookie cutter, no creativity required
ttyd was probably the most adventurous world outside the mushroom kingdom we'll ever see. ttyd had more visually unique zones than odyssey
"Toads reproduce asexually now" hence, all the toads in recent PM games
It's obvious that they cut corners
be like the M&L series. good games that slowly declined only to die.
look at the toads in the glitzville
i bet she has a secret
Rougeport's cool cuz when Mario first shows up, and no one gives a shit cuz no one knows or cares who Mario is
We'll never see Toads like that ever again.
please tell me I did not just hear "the hot toad"
Also, Toadles is another creative toad design
also club 64 in this game. Thats what defines a good paper mario game. Does it have a bar
We can't have old toads anymore apparently
The Master is a Toad as well
gotta break into nintendo hq and free toadsworth
The Sailor Bob-omb in Chapter 5 who challenges the captain to hammers, at dawn
how tf would the Bob-omb dude even have swung the hammer
free kammy koopa too. I know she's similar to kamek but kammy was so funny
And it's not just Toads they did that too either. They did it to Bob-Ombs, Koopas, etc.
while we're at it free the koopa kids from mario party 4-6
Fun fact if it hasnt been mentioned yet: the Master and Tayce T. are siblings
koopa kid vs baby bowser vs bowser jr
Was Paper Mario the first Mario game to have friendly Goombas and Koopas???
damn, that's quite the heart attack
@buff00n I see what you did there. Kappa
i haven't played color splash probably never would
don't have my wii u anymore
I watched playthroughs of Sticker Star, Color Splash, and Origami King.
Honestly, it wasn't something I could get into.
Lets pick up gombario and use him against bowser PogChamp
Next update: "Shorten Bowser's Castle" removes that room
Room Sucks 2: The Room With No Door
waiting for the YouTube upload where the video ends less than a minute cuz you rolled Goombario at the start
Shooting Star Summit straight to Final!
Shooting Star Summit straight to credits Kappa
first progression item straight to credits
You touch the last card and you instantly go into the Jr Fight in Bowser's Castle
Time to fold the big lizard
using a jammin jelly to restore 2fp? outrageous
It would've been even more of a power play if he threw the jammin jelly away. Kappa
I haven't played XC3, or seen much of it, but I can confidently say that Eunie would say "fuck" if she wasn't in a Nintendo game
I would like to find a gombario and feeling fine throw pillow just to give them to you SeriousSloth
I would be very excited if I had a sub 4 rando playthrough
also, she'd 100% take the piss outta the XC2 cast's clothing
You should keep track of your "personal worst" in addition to your pb
that was basically your average, right?
Can you show your angle rq before I go to bed?
Did you play the Dark Star mod?
Day 2 of college, an essay due next week :)
Chapter 1 of this book is 45 pages too wtf
you uploading the run from mwsf right?
ok cuz I cant catch it live
have sushie belly flop the whale
My hammerless + full gear shuffle seeds always like to give me early super boots
Get the coin for 60 star pieces
goombario is essentially worse than getting a coin
He is all powerful thank you phanto274Thonk
Gonna do a seed tonight lol
Rando but the devs secretly removed hammer
wait, you don't have a hammer?
BLOODY KNEW IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
that's rando apologizing for the fake hammer, I guess
*Sunny in Philly music* Phantom Reluctantly Saves The Yoshis
Gear Rando seems to love giving you Tier 2 items early
the Rando Randy is back at it again!
Theres a wicked thunderstorm coming through my place. Fantastic rain and thunder every 30 seconds
I didn't even gamble I forgot this was coming up
My poor Golden Retriever is petrified right now. She hates thunder, we had a strike hit just meters from the house in 2021
GEEZ, we had a strike with a 2 second sound delay
Oh yeah, were fine. We have a generator too just in case
I think its 3. 9 HP Red seems high for 2
Oh psykitHeck . This storm cell expanded. This rain will last at least another 25 minutes.
Oh I love severe weather. I was in University in Long Island when Superstorm Sandy hit. Was handled well though, very little power disruption (just a few hours) and we were on a hill so minimal flooding
i think you picked up a red berry earlier
And then we had Winter Storm Nemo the next year and walking through a 3 snow deep campus was astounding.
where i live the busses never shut down
did.. did you start with goombario?
can you star the murder mystery and sushie glitch into 7?
B L O O P E R
YAAAAAH, that was a point blank hit. Practically within our complex
Does Dizzy Stomp have better odds with Action command?
And I assume you've checked everything in 5?
Do you need to have finish chapter 5 to give him the volcanos vase ?
How much of Boo's Mansion have you done?
Did you check all the boxes you could reach?
are there any tree checks where you would save Kolorado in the jungle? I left and came back. Out of the loop
Anywho, lets beat the game now
Yeah, Watt's ability is used in what, 3 rooms in the entire game?
Hard required in 4 and only sometimes in Whale/Yoshis
Beat 1 while you can still get XP here
TBF hardly any of it was probably in logic to begin with
I don't see any logic for Staircase Skip
So you're supposed to be able to beat a chapter besides 1 already...
imainge rowf with all 4 seeds LUL
Probably something important in the Ruins
Or Kooper + Palace Key Kappa
In that case, let's hope the important stuff is in Ruins and not 7
Going to the Desert the long way around
Imma Luigi. You want my autograph?
just a wee bit of softlock risk
this seed has like 8 fortress keys wtf
Who's trying to assassinate Merlon? monkaS
some real Indiana Jones trap in there
Well, if both of the ones in Ruins are real, 1 is in logic as soon as 2 is
It's always weird when the shells twitch
weighted to fail because you can just do things like that
is it even possible to fill the bar on those abilities? Even with Turbo?
Game hard caps you at 15 mashes/sec
I always have to refresh the stream after a star spirit because it gets out of sync
oh yeah it goes to absolute poop with all those particle effects
Do you have that Bow skip enabled? (Is it an option?)
wow, game shop got a switch n64 controller
so they bought one from Nintendo and are reselling it? I didn't think it was available at retail
I'm sure I would've done it eventually but just hadn't felt like working on it recently
Again, I'll probably get to it eventually
how did you get here without parakerry?
lmao. Makes it sound so simple
was it as easy as its look?
i you use a seed over a month old the tracker wont update
What did you get stuck on there?
wow my interrnet is trash tonight
it's hitched a bit for me too
anyway, it's phanto274Lurk  time for me
nah its me, after I quit stream I ran a speed test and had 3 up, ran it 5 minutes later and had 11 up
only 2 hrs and 20 minutes late. not bad!!
so with kojima doing a podcast im expecting game awards to have "best podcast"
tried a seed with new settings today, it was quite enjoyable
my extreme seed had a parakarry start
letter to merlon was in shroom grocery, which lead to my hammer
so took me 1 min to get a hammer lmao
my seed was kinda goated. I was preparing to full clear koot but go mode last second so no needed
my last 2 have been really good seeds
I'll have to roll your next lmao
my seed had super boots in the first pleasant path room
and both power pluses were 2 bp and one was toad town while other was Koopa village
so I got too strong too fast
ok go bomb every tree now
time to finally use those 10 fortress keys
I'm gonna do an offline glitchless run in about 20 min. pray for me
bombette looks sick, you should get her to a doctor
time to play guess the damage
Technically chapter 6 was the first in logic monadoKEK
Or you can just find Ultra Hammer
Did you check Chapter 3 shop?
oh yeah i need to remember to actually practice this
Why reset? Was that a softlock?
and you were telling me i was going straight to rac
I normally have her out I think
then select her from the partner menu still
Watch it be useless anyway Sadge
I don't think so, I never went neutral there
It's possible it could be patched
So about that early Ultra Hammer skip...
We get to watch Kolorado fall AGAIN!
just got done a seed myself
all sanity with all the new shit LUL
and even with boot and hammer shuffle super boots was pre boo portrait chap 3 I felt cheated
With current settings, you aren't guaranteed to find another upgrade
also the news skins are really nice
still waiting on a laki skin
I wish someone could do something about parakerry skins not a knock on the artist but to me they look like normal parakerry but dirty
I see you don't have the calculator. I'm calling it now, kooper is behind the Calc.
but for your sake, I hope not. l0l
I can I just say that the radio quest is dumb and really doesn't add anything and I love it LUL
isnt it only 3 more checks
i have it on every seed and have never done it
Speaking of, have you done the radio checks?
Wait, you don't have the leaf nvm
koot I like makes some very irrelevant items relevant
How much of Dojo have you done?
FULL LETTERS AND FULL KOOT IN WEEKLIES OR RIOT Keepo
A postman's work is truly never done.
What are the odds of no Goomba letters?
But all 3 in the 5 you don't have?
phantom, can you give yourself some time to dink?
Ultra Hammer makes panels faster and makes you backtrack to volcano YEP
I had a hard triple dip of fortress in my seed
Yay! I caught you live again!
watch kooper is dizzy stomp chest
DELIVERING LETTERS IS PEAK PAPE CONTENT
it's like recipes in hundo it's what the people want
I timed myself doing my usual 3 star spirit rando settings and I got a 4:19:48
It was my third(?) I think. Last one was like over 6 hours so I cant complain haha
Shoutouts to the NPCs for keeping you in Peril
or hear me out on this
don't and go get tacos instead
Didn't you say you had turned off early Toybox?
Are we still having fun? CoolStoryBob
Okay so since Im new here Id like to know your favorite color choices for everything haha
And even least favorite if you have it
>game makes you do the same fight three times to get thru the room >best game of all time
I dont think Ive seen blow bombette but this one is pretty cute
i really like the ice flower mario
Ive Mario is probably my new favorite
Sushi doesnt really have good ones yet
Mentioning Goombario but forgetting Sushie LUL
I guess I like when shes red and yellow but only if Im Mario maker colors so we match lmao
you need to get a freaking settings command lul
My settings are so easy to beat lmao Ive been trying to learn from your VODS so I can start switching some things and make it more challenging
is one of the new settings a random Bowser color yet
I just caught the stream you uploaded recently with the 3 upgrades in like 5 minutes lmao
Can we see reverse Toybox since you don't need to do any checks?
You can laki teleport but it's tough
I think you can go around the right lz
What's Power Plus like? Or do you even have it?
youre missing so many key items lmao
Most likely 7 or one of the random Extremes
And like half of the optional key items
Look up Bow and Koopa Leaf when you check spoiler
Koopa Leaf could be on a Shy Guy
koopa leaf can be the pebble check in ch7 now
But I imagine you checked that
That was Last Stand you took off
How much does Hallway fire normally do?
Or you can play it safe with Power Rush
Well you might have found it if I hadn't asked about the Toad Town tree first
What did Koot and Dojo have? Anything interesting?
wow something actually behind the trade quest
came back just in time. GG. This took longer than a normal glitchless run lmao
Garbage, garbage, and money I guess
I watched it right when we got to Gourmet Guy somehow
wait sorry it was Glenn's run right?
cause I watched both you and Glenn
I was busy being an insomniac
I was also there watching Star Tropics with the constant, "Wow, You've Done It!"
I saw Glenn sitting there and I think you were cut off
I just filled my hydro flask with Baja Blast, now I'm ready
Hey Phantom ! What item tracker do you use for Randos..?
you think I'm going to give you MY MONEY?
why didn't you just bring your own? smh
can't play PM on a Smash monitor after all
not a random?? where is phantom and what have you done with him
Im super good just got done playing a little Overwatch on stream
i got 3 wins in a row
anywho, can't hang out too much today; wb and glhf on glundo.
totally get it. i have a hole in my heart that is only filled by competitive multiplayer games
its better then playing League at least
(needed food so I missed it)
i redeemed a rando once too
how you doin? how was your flight?
i cant play games in the car but can on a plane for some reason
cats race is neck and neck rn
like literally in the same room LUL
National Beach Day? Oh boy! *goes outside* It's raining. :(
There was no audio for the alert
Hikari is laying on the floor howling at the mirror KEKW
So THAT'S how you say it
Why did it go twice lol
that's not what that emote is
It's a very good emote though
I think the dono bot is confused. LUL
Husky knocking away a bowl of food
i couldnt tell what it said
Buff00n posted a picture he said he was gonna delete from vegas
He put it on the circle lol
You'll enjoy it you should look at it when you get a free moment I assume he already added you
Twitter Circle is very silly addition
we can shit talk without people knowing
Idk if I'm still gonna use the alt now lol
I don't need a buff00n alt
I was going to make a stupid probably unoriginal tweet for my first circle, but I decided to just say hi. :^)
Bonk Jr. Troopa to assert your dominance. Kappa
time to go for 50 attempts of speedy
Jesse has already started talking shit in his circle
I saw through your circle lmao
Mario needs to make a sprite
All is well. How about yourself?
I just love how Jesse went from "Hey look at my circle" to "stupid ass bitches" in less than a minute
Summer should actually be a week long
Winter makes people leave minnesota and that's fucking lit
I love not having to talk to people at work in the winter
@TacoGuyy I actually *come* to Minnesota in the winter, to ski
Yo the bot also watches HotS PogChamp
Winter is awesome cause it's nice and cold and I can go outside without sweating the first second I leave the house.
Getting warmer is a much more pleasant experience than getting cooler
Warmer you get a nice fire and a blanket and you just exist
I hate heaters but I like wrapping myself up in a burrito with blankets shrimpsCOMFY .
We got rain in what feels like MONTHS.
Finally some moisture in this DRY climate. LUL
I also get to be dripped out in Winter. shrimpsDrip
Advantage state removed the counterpicks woohoo
Lylat and yoshis are gone and they put hollow bastion
Kalos being there doesn't even matter it's perma banned for me and they have no reason not to ban it lol
I honestly like HB and Lylat, I just think Yoshi's Story (Melee) is stupid.
They're also begging failbot to play solo steve now lol
Failbot hasn't lost anything he's gone steve at for a bit lol
But yea 3 bans means I will never not go to ps2 lol
yo that's crazy power rush was vanilla.
@Twitch how do I ban a mod
Former blackice TO replied to me saying they tried to get a state wide stagelist and the other TO's just said "We don't care" LOL
I'm unfollowing if you do what you do
But yea the starters are Battlefield | Pokmon Stadium 2 | Smashville | Town & City | Small Battlefield, I will only be picking ps2
I'm wario, they're not giving me the other stages lol
And they have 3 bans for counterpicks so I will be doing PS2 sets
8 and 3 is not rad
yo glgl (no audio) (chat) (watching at work)
yo blopez (I cant read) (chat) (watching at home)
don't let him girlboss gaslight you, he's a very fast reader
then why are you using japanese tags?
Axl reload and look at his tags he's lying to you
i thing happened while you were gone
prof9 and the gang added in mod cards to bn4
I added what I could of a el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo tag
can you get dodge master this early?
4 times but who's counting? Kappa
time to lurk and play hitman 3
It was 20 bucks on humblebundle
Yea I was playing 2 and 1 before
we finished 10 seconds or something apart LMFAO
aww, I was hoping Glundo was Golden LePiggy 100%
The one you sped past or was it opened?
it has air, is what you're saying?
but in all seriousness I didn't know there was a 101% what is the extra 1%
So I tried to start derusting a game for GDQ last night, it didn't go well
this is at least sub 10 pace
no, submission videos, DreamWorks Dragons Dawn of New Riders
It's actually my favorite speedgame ever
I also am doing a Toy Story Relay with two other people for submissions this year
Zic is my Toy Story 2 runner
But it would be all 3 Toy Story games in a row one after the other, if done correctly it would only take 2 1/2 hours
Is that a good thing or bad thing that your pb for Ch. 3 is 16 mins?
my Toy Story 3 PB is 45 minutes or around that
randos lately has been good. extreme async went well
At least we will save Stanley
my longest speedrun is 7 hours but this seems more bearable than the one I run
fight the wrong blooper and then save for the first time the entire run like me
Do we still need to make the cake or did we do that
it's because his quizzes are very "dry dry"
did you run through anything before starting this or are you all in
I forgot to mention that my DreamWorks Dragons Dawn of New Riders game JUST got new strats two weeks ago and I haven't been able to practice them because I haven't made it that far
its impossible to get higher than 6
Without a Life Shroom pt. 2
being a WR holder for that game sucks
lmao i just saw the el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo tag
just farm 48 quizmos in a row or whatever itll be a problem for future phantom
wait wheres the splatoon 3 splatfest at... what is this lol
Don't say it like that, "I will do him later" LUL
"I will do him later" -Phantom5800, August 2022
I get to see Prologue again so I'm not against that. :)
so no splatoon3 for u then
I WAS HERE FOR THE QUOTE
@Ohrocks Yessir, prologue is pretty PogChamp
One of the best prologues in gaming history tbh
PhantoBot bot needs to learn how to construct proper sentences still...
Being a mod in another channel makes me want to add quotes at all times LUL
The bot is still learning how human speech works. LUL
I don't blame it for not knowing how the english language works.
The run depends on it. LUL
If we say Goombario enough times maybe bot will summon him into their speech
Yo I couldnt catch your run at mwsf cuz I was stuck at work but I popped in for a bit and it seemed like you did great!! spaget3Love
Ok got a silent assassin on level 1 and a buncha level xp
@tacoguyy you missed the new quote
What if you're the stupid shyguy
if i was gonna get a pizza ad coming into chat could it at least been a good pizza place and not papa john's
Thank you @scrambleddragons I couldn't remember how to spell it
@SteveTVOnline You're welcome. <3 Sad thing is I can remember names from video games but not irl. It's a curse, I tell you. :(
How to beat Gourmet Guy: Step 1 - Cake
Interesting that hitting all the coin blocks isn't counted toward 100% in this game, unlike a certain other Paper Mario game I know of...
i still need to come back and run this to test my routing changes but it's such a long run and i've been wanting to do other stuff ResidentSleeper
slots could be HUGE for extra coins
you get like 10 or 15
can we add el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo to the slots
slots is cool and all but hear me out
What would max% even look like in this game?
You're robbing my fucking goombario time
accidentally using the safer partner lol
The only time we use Goombario and we don't use Goombario. :(
That's what you get for not using Goombario
hey i've missed that jump and then fallen onto that fucker and died before
You missed it because you didn't use Goombario. Kappa
This whole time I have been family friendly not realizing I could use FUCK
this fight is cringe and i am almost definitely gonna change it to just use a repel gel cause idgaf
just give me the normal fight back
we can easily make up for the coins
what's cringe about the funny shy guys?
This run going good I assume?
that zoom in surprises me every time
general guy graciously killing you before quizmo does, what a hero
I walk back over and you're fighting Lantern Ghost again...
i've lost plenty of runs and/or time to chapter 4 in glundo so i feel the pain
yea so looking at it i'm not seeing a feasible way to keep the desert life shroom in your inventory, it'd take some deeper rerouting to make work
also you have dodge master right
oh we have to bake a cake?
bake a cake for the bestie
excuse me streamer where are your cake in and cake out splits
cake in oven and cake in mouth are better
cake in my mouth is best tbh
careful not to gold too hard ;)
that's why all the pacepals are here
yea don't worry when quizmo shows up i'll uh
peach actually poisoning my boi by uncooking this cake! Gourmet Guy rates this cake 0.5/10.
I can't trust mf'rs who say they like a doughy cake
it's 7 seconds on either side of 30
enjoy your 3 in 10 chance every reload
It's All or nothing or nothing at all.
hey with my routing changes it's a 1 in 3 chance :)
well you are more likely to  get all or nothing than to not get speedy
It's like Cooking Mama but Paper Mario
hey phantom! glad you're back! how was speedfest?!
is this just an any percent speedrun?
parakarry sacrificing himself to save mario... what a hero
didn't realize whacka was counted in the all bosses definition
oh did we just kill whacka
isn't the hardest boss Prologue Bowser?
don't know if you remember or not, but I made a donation during your run at speedfest saying "only a little over 2hrs late!" lol
but I made it to your run! I was so stoked! and I can't believe the tech problems that happened during your run! I was so upset.
We'll find out soon enough. Kappa
this is the first time ever watching a 100% lol
I still think glundo should allow Yoshi skip
@Ohrocks No it shouldn't. Save the babies.
Yoshi's wandered into the jungle so they deserve it
They're just little baby Yoshis. They don't know any better.
TRADE OFFER!!! 1 COIN FOR 1 SUCC!
do you have to defeat all enemies in this run?
@Ohrocks Sounds like a good deal. rickslSmile
the optional enemies routed in are the most efficient coin grind we have while not going out of ourway
some of them are also difficult encounters to avoid so it reduces risk
I still refuse to believe that is a glitch
I think not being able to do it is an EN glitch YEP
an attempt to patch it was made, anyway
it's not a glitch, it's a feature. stickshamGaslight
Sounds more like an exploit than a glitch to me
Therefore the EN version is a glitch YEP
At least you got that one extra Spear Guy, right?
yup cause we use bow on lp
What is this "lp" you speak of?
I only know of the hole in the wall behind Kolorado Kappa
Unless it's to make badge equips easier for next time
Kolorado denied your flip panel. He's very powerful.
we need damage dodge on jr
and we dont have room to also use power plus, hence all or nothing instead
I wonder if we can mega shock this fight
would skip three attacks so probably
hiiii idk if you learned, but I got back into bf :)
I'd have to look into it more, I don't remember any of the fights in this route lmao
I actually just had to remember how we handled vsync framerate and my brain fried trying to remember cause I was trying to reply to someone on steam forums
I am derusting on the game this saturday btw, with hardest mystery frameone so I will suffer :)
Is winning part of the category or you need the jammin jelly?
Need them all for recipes? monkaS
Convenient thats theres only 4 recipes and theres exactly 4 jellies before bowsers castle
I remember doing a casual 100% run and wasted one jammin jelly somewhere so I couldn't get all the recipes before going to Bowser. :(
I am doing a walkthrough of the rf5 route rn
Item duping is so incredibly simple it's absurd and cuts out like any ounce of item grinding lol
The setup is mild rng on which frame it works because apparently even with macros it wasn't consistent but it takes literally 2 seconds to retry
I just watched Taco make a storage chest grow
Yea you pick up a well and hit a chest with it a bunch and then you have 100 pies
When are you doing a glando?
And that's the route at the start LOL
ALso the cutscene skip has a chance to make the screen just go black but if you warp home and get to your bed to sleep you can undo it
This game is literally what I was already doing....
They even fucking described the movement tech as "Easy to do hard to do well" and that's just item sliding LOL
Imagine how crazy that would be.
Also the notes for the route that the wr holder just made
I just want to give a shoutout to yal from bug fables :)
Gives me strats and shit on bosses and how to do things
Lol it autocorrected but I decided to leave jt
this is giving me flashbacks pepeW
@Ohrocks just wait till you see when I get the ability to do the movement glitch
Thats one case where rando would be easier
that's not a strange leaf, that's a cool leaf!
Does the category require you to check the chalkboard at the end?
Cuz if you forget a recipe, thatd be really hard for someone to figure out
guess which category is only done on jp
Yo you can QRT to the circle
I can PQRT without the P
I recently read the text for when petunia gives you the bean and its really depressing. She tells you not to plant the bean because once you do its stuck in one location and loses all its freedom :(
Fuck that bean we got places to be
Which also makes you think, if thats true, how do the different sentient flowers know each other?
what can mario see in a race???
I think he just said bitch
since when is that there lmao
Yo, did bot just cuss us out? LUL
must be playing on v1.1 smh my head
he's playing the version that added that and patched glitches
That's why he's not doing them
bosses been good though so far?
i cant wait for true 100% with all item blocks and loose overworld coins
i think this is the first time im seeing parakarry actually do some damage bawkBait
if only the pacepals knew the truth about these splits...
Do you need the Jammin Jelly Peach has?
peach predicted shape shifters in Among Us
see? peach can be helpful in her own rescue if she really tried
I have the first movement glitch now
This one is tame and on the floor but it stacks incredibly fast
wouldn't it be faster to star storm and then bounce? you'd have 2 dying animations but you wouldn't need to outta sight and you wouldn't need to watch both baby bloops miss. maybe there's something i'm overlooking but that fight felt like it could be improved
I'm pretty drunk right now, help me
someone should make sure super bloop actually follows the script and time it though
@SteveTVOnline hi pretty drunk right now, help me
yea i'll check to make sure but i can't imagine a world where it isn't faster tbh
Can equip Damage Dodge and block 1 instead if you are literally an infant at Paper Mario
Also if you want a small glimpse of the difference switch vs pc makes for this game
These notes say you save 2+ minutes in JUST the last cutscene on pc
Text scrolls significantly faster when the game is running
To be honest I hate it but you know if you ask in the morning I will say otherwise
I hate to be THAT person
oooh so I live with my parents and my mom caught THE VIRUS and that was literally was I was trying to tell you LUL my drunk brain figured that out
Hey Phantom, good luck on your run! jcogWave
yikes, make a drinking game out of it lol. shot = quizmo question
new quizmo grind game idea: every question you make a mistake on, die a little inside
i kidna forgot this room existed during my run
did i come in at the worst part
wait is that quizmo number at the bottom accurate NiceSoftlock
when did you notice you were missing one to begin with? chapter 4?
are you using route from the spreadsheet?
so yes minus my recent changes
goomba village? where you start the game?
watch it be somewhere in toybox
I'm basically watching this blind so I'm just sitting here all :)
you were going back anyways right?
So this is the next hour of the run
What is the chance he shows up each time you check?
oh yeah see it now just out of order on this route lol
there's 5 star pieces from summit
all these quizmos reminding me of all of my assignments i gotta do this week bawkSalt
damn that worm is fuckin with you
you should send a bird after his ass
almost 20 more to go, which is close to 15 and rounding that down is like 10 and 10 is basically like a handful so youll be done in no time
In other words, youre almost almost almost almost almost done
time is made up by big clock to sell hands
Meanwhile I'm watching the audience and it's kinda strange
Luigi and a single Koopa Bro, among others
when I was a kid tubba blubba scared me so I could never do the escape sequence
so I just played over and over up to that part
i 100%ed this game once or twice as a kid
my save file was 20 hours
he was said to be invincible so many times it scared me!!! And the escape music was panic inducing!!!! I was 9!!!
To be fair, you probably encounter Quizmo more often when you aren't blazing through the entire rest of the game
just finished watching yugioh dark side of demensions with komari... what a wild ride LUL
Koopa Koot or first playthrough and don't know where to go
Quizmo doesnt carre about your splits!!!
It woulda been so much better if you kept going till you got one wrong
i see phantomgamesbot, it all makes sense now
okay but did you find goombario yet
runs not valid if you dont pick him up
from looking at the timer, that rng seems to sucks....or your pb was godlike idk
I ordered an everdrive a few days ago and its currently in Kiev
You just got a volt shroom
The Volt Shroom you just made?
ive been yakking for the past 5 hours
I reeeeally need to sleep but I want to watch the end....FUCK YOU
steve what did you drink and/or still drinking?
Entering Goomba Village for the 9001st time
4PAny% run finished processing while i was at work lets go
I had 4 cups of water and a shit ton of saltines
My go to is vodka soda
still sad we never saw this song in the fucked up sounds rando
I might have had to much
the hardest part about 100% / Glundo is keeping track of everything and keeping track of everything you did or didn't do
Learned that there's weird properties to the duped items
Need to save/reload to make them actually function so I fucked up a later dupe and had to redo lol
Also Lucy is dead to me in these runs
If you talk to her once you lose 10 minutes
If you don't talk to someone, their love events never show up
So we send her to the bakery and never acknowledge that she's a human
is that the only place to get cake mix?
Who cares she's dead to me currently
poor guy is cowering leave them alone
I'm sorry to everyone for my drunkness including you phantom
With buff00n existing I don't think phantom minds drunkenness
I mean being drunk I try not to be but if I am I won't complain
@popesquidward I promise I am always not like this
it's to also have fp for kent
Mario: FINE, I'LL DO IT MYSELF
wait you can jump on his tail?
@landy_00 yup! it's his weak point
I never knew as a kid either
the koopa at the entrance to koopa village tells you!
i never knew that. i guess i haven't fought him since i was a kid
I just spammed D-Down jump on him cuz I didn't realize that weak point when I was a kid
ive been lurking for most of the stream howzit
I wish I was sober enough to understand anything at this point
*D-Down Jump when flipping him over
You're typing awfully well for being drunk
how do you manage to do an 8 hour speedrun
maybe he's on mobile and has autocorrect
I would get sick of it an hour through
isnt the playground a better way to make money?
you can tell how drunk i am by the amount of typos i make
It takes me waaaay to long to type something @landy_00
now do it again and get wr
I'm sorry @phantom5800 for being drunk in your chat
You're not a good drunkard if you have shame
I've been drunk in chat before, but I just didn't tell anyone
@stevetvonline I'm getting there. 3 beers in
Let's take a vote: Press 1 if you think @SteveTVOnline should feel shame and 2 if you think not
does laki's cloud not have a name? they are two different creatures no?
instead chat tell us why goombario is the best partner
Flushed why you lookin at his nimbus
Are they two separate sentient entities?? Are the turtle part and the cloud part born together?? Do they meet up and partner for life in some ritual??
I'm trying to think, whats the last badge?
Cheating in a rando is going to feel so good next time you do one
I wish I could do comm for you for NoGA but I have to work stevet13FeelsBirdMan
The servers should keep being mean
no pressure but this is maddi bop pace
Guess Maddi will need to bop phantom next
my drunk ass thought it was over
Why do you fight the 3 Antis? Star points? Is it faster?
Why glitchless hundo surely you have better things you can do in 8 hours LUL
yup you're ahead of my by 4 minutes
yea not bad at all, looking like a 7:17ish
you might not hold the b button well enough
yup beat me by 4 minutes flat lol gg
have fun uploading this beast to youtube
Im going to bed, gnight yall
"you ever just think about the plot of Kingdom Hearts and get angry" - Alpharad
I'm debating on playing strive and messing with jacko labbing rn or doing rf5
It has movement tech, I'll be fine
I just have a strive bug rn
Genuinely just flying around was super fucking fun last night LOL
You go out of bounds constantly in dungeons and skip most fights
The last dungeon you can't go oob because of the ceiling and you also never get good defense, so despite your damage it's still not free and it's hype
The only thing we ever do is make a weapon to abuse spells there's never armor made and so many fights are skipping so levels
The only boring part of the run is the midnight wait
And you just cram a buncha material grinding into that because a single story event needs you to wait until midnight which is 20 minutes lol
Honestly the lack of a sleep exploit to get defense increases my interest in this particular rf game so much
Early game is still a bit long but it's not nearly as bad
Less sidequest grinding too cause you don't need the points to buy shit you actually want to run out at a point so you can still cutscene skip lol
I also added "ManILoveRNG" as a tag
My WW attempt count is like 400
It started racking up after pause storage because outset lol
Nintendo direct is now trending with windwaker according to twitter
That time of the month again
But I'd rather have TP first
I'd like to be able to play TP without buying it for 100 on gc or emulating it
I'm just gonna tweet this emote name rq el:Wadafa:yelpanaFrienddandoleunabrazo
and by errands i mean buying a new TV
last week it was 1800, today I got it for 850
And sometimes you just need a costco churro in your life
what am I agree on? someone irl was talking
does pokemon actually split red and blue?
bn5 has a non split category at least
They 'leaked' zelda remasters yet again
This is what like the 15th time LOL
who leaked Zelda remasters? Where at?
Doesn't matter twitter is just idiots
Just the usual nintendo rumor accounts tweeting
Why do I keep hearing about a September direct?
when will Nintendo make a Zelda 3D All-Stars that's available for three months before going into the Disney vault?
@TacoGuy74 September is a month they've done one in for the past few years so people are just 'leaking' things they want to get twitter likes rn lol
Folks, looks like we're strapped in for another partner showcase
For any%, no dick run yet
The only comment says "You took my pp bridge record :("
At this point I need to get a wiggle emote too...
Phantom can't cause his little ghost bastard got no neck let alone a torso
could just use a wiggling dusknoir
risch running heatbug was pretty cool
"thanks for unclogging my toilet full of Mets, Megaman.EXE!"
but you haven't defeated PlumberMan yet
as his hands move ever close to the reset button...
how many resets did I miss Kappa
you got me for 30 minutes
gotta fit in bakuman watch parties whenever I can
how is your game schedule looking?
your focusing on bn6 for the marathon right?
damn phantom u don't like any games huh lol except smash paper and mega lol.. never buying the new hotness lol
ashikabi66: damn phantom u don't like any games huh lol except smash paper and mega lol.. never buying the new hotness lol
u housing MVD my dude for port priority
2 am and 5 am on workdays ... Sorry I won't be able to support o:
that boii like every other smash books everything last min lol
hope that have a better pape setup, the color was so dull
so itll be your fault then LUL
i mean dont they run tech before the run?
how can you draw something that doesnt exist Kappa
have you tried to reg trnarrw?
mod cards my guy, buy an eReader
smog has good alpha omega notes Kappa
i fall in that camp too
neverr wrote anything down for nut the prism
for bn5 I made notes from jugoomba, "komari, did I miss anything?" OMEGALUL
I am so thankful to the current RF5 wr holder for making good notes
that should be a bot quote
Think there's a video guide for RF5 but I'm just using the doc and watching the wr vod to learn it
That's how I feel with Ori
Run is mega cool but it's just so ass to learn because of the way they did shit
I don't wanna go through a google slideshow to learn a 100% route
Lemme send you the rf5 route to look at after this it's a pretty well written route
im part of the problem tho
all the notes ive made are slides
It's so much easier to search specific parts of a doc than a slideshow
They say keyword I control f and then look back at how I do it again or a specific note
imagine having bn notes that dont say "get copydmg"
how the hell do you do heatman without copydmg?
where can I get these so called fire chips?
next yeah is a special year
it marks 10 years ive been watching bn speedruns
bn 6 is the only one of these ive plated
ero used to run 6 and 4 lol
still have the cart in my gba FeelsStrongMan
tell us whats in your navicust so we can laugh at you
back and B is so free
ok so i dont think i even knew navicust existed
THIS MAN HAD NOTHING IN HIS NAVICUST!!!
i just have 4 like speed +1 on
your bn3 notes do you get fish?
or do you manip iceball M?
I thought this was a pape channel
your not doing slipwalk, right? Kappa
would suck if you game crashed during a no glitches allowed marathon OMEGALUL
I hope some JP runner bops my BeastSP times
yeah, that would be even better
so mega man go fast now
speedrunning is generally tough in general, i find
setting up the gamecube stuff on the wii was a lot easier than i expected
it definitely works, i tested out a prime 1 rando earlier. died, so the run was over, but it worked really well
it fits in my draw so nice
so now I have a desk mat for both PCs
i'm so used to rando, that when i actually finished a casual play of paper mario, i forgot there was a whole ass epilogue cutscene
allowing everdrive is cool but then i wasted funds on my jpn cart fml
if we end time on star rod...
Does the cutscene even matter or don't you just hold B for the text?
I got my GDQ clear glass mug too
my snes raphnet came today too
can you do me a solid tonight?
now i just need to figure out how to somehow play symphony of the night on the wii lol
stream long enough for me to get 7K more channel points KEKW
doesnt pape need game time to verify?
probably gonna do pit of 100 trials to get the double inventory tonight
more life shrooms and boo sheets lol
what if time started when you take control of mario in castle?
i mean you don't get speed until chapter 3 in pape ttyd
it feels so good using the SNES mini controller on my old SNES
would you call it baby paper mario or paper baby mario?
but his name is paper mario so it would be baby paper mario KEKW
bombette and watt are true pog
And what does koops have besides a girlfriend
and a shield he can throw on mario
also, i love the little mention of kolarado in hooktail castle from the one dry bones
what drops speedy, anyway? i forget
what is it paper mario and making you buy trash to progress
and why is a dried shroom always involved
where's that homeward shroom when you need it
my retro game shop has complete in box pokemon heart gold, white2, black2 all for 150 each, then diamond is only 50 OMEGALUL
mx_four: PerMitzi: oh yeah the crack
gotta love those retro game stores, axl
Oh man i really walk into those phanto274Facepalm
realblopez: mx_four: PerMitzi: oh yeah the crack
i can relate to both ends :)
yes that question is for everyone who wants to answer it
i feel like i jsut inserted myself
Prime Gamingmx_four: i feel like i jsut inserted myself Prime Gamingr
well my cruella deville grandma has finally made it to hospice
im kinda tired but i gotta cook lol
my dab rig got here a day early so im a HAPPY CAMPER
ROIGHT now I just need the stuffs and I get paid tomorrow phanto274BLANKIES
was gonna cook it with my gf like a week ago but we never got around to it lmao
been living off air fried burgers lol
we had pizza every day at pdq LOL
i did not eat pizza for like a week
my mom brought me carne asada burritos cats4eWiggle
nah it's great tbh esp bc i dont like cooking much bc of the time investment
i am a food enjoyer though
you should make lasagna lopez. You can live off one lasagna for like a couple days
when my parents make lasagna they make extra noodles just for me
im so damn lazy lmao theres some chores i should get around to doing but im too damn tired/cba
Cant wait for work on monday. I get that juicy time and a half pay
I like my new job. People are nice and I barely have to speak to them.
someone tried to pull the ol "test out this game for me" nonsense on me on discord cats4eWiggle
i mean, at least lp was easy
they made this elaborate story with it too. I was like 10/10 story but still no
only if it had rando built in
phantom, DM mitzi witha code for your game OMEGALUL
still waiting on fall guys yugioh cross over to happen
phantom forgot how to do it
been away from the game too long playing exe6
I am labbing jacko shit rn
Her blockstrings do more damage than millia optimals
And it's always a 50/50 between +518249018238 minion swing or throw to reset it lolll
And throws beat dp in this game :)
Millia dies from blockstring offense and jacko wins off touching your block once lol
yugioh cards would have a code on the bottom you could enter to get them in game
Also this patch they made whistle make you safe after any move
So if I do an unsafe lunging normal she has into whistle I can just leave
oops, I think you know what chat that was intended for KEKW
Also her 5h that lunges halfscreen just teleports you back on whistle cancel LOL
at least we're somewhat still making decent time
Yoo, I finally caught a stream! phanto274BLANKIES
I just threw a ky into a corner and popped minion super
And she has the best meter build in the game
Because how many specials you input
Like if you're in the corner against jacko your options are take the chip or take the wallbreak
And if you give her positive bonus she can meme you harder lol
Cause then the minion strings genuinely never end
And she'll have RC advancing normals
But yea I'm getting the hang of minion setups I just need to get the feel for non millia neutral now
Cause that's the part I can't play the same lol
phantom in xeno3 is Sera still best girl?
3 is less than 4, you're good
I would but my rando today was a bad seed so I'm banned from. making one
how would making you a seed go?
i only have 6k points lol
sooooo, allsanity goombario start, got it
gimme seed too, I'm bored and need something to do
just give him the race seed, hell never know KEKW
do you care about glitch logic or nah?
i wanna see it happen, actually
so i send the settings string or the seed number?
ill probably do the seed too, glitchless is up my alley
your hat matches goombario, how cute
i actually forgot to set a partner for start, so goombario start was completely happenstance
is that a grape following you around?
she's kinda see through right now tho
its so the game doesnt crash
how many raphnets do you have?
at least merlow isn't needed for progress
i mean, we can at least check panels early
i mean, can't be much worse than that 100% race lol
oh yeah, i don't think there's traps on this seed
thats always nice, no traps so no worries
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers. com
The bots are on to something though
If you want followers, just fuck em
omg i love bombettes color its so pretty
green and red are just nah
i mean the red is so bad that its almost cool looking?
damn... nine got banned for a simple greeting RIP my guy
know whats more fun than playing mario kart 8 online?
playing mario kart 8 by yourself!!
blooper, perhaps? or desert by way of shortcut
cause then you dont have people picking BABY PARK!!
what you don't like ovals axl?
The more I lab this char
The more thankful I am that nobody plays her
This hurts my hands but people fucking die in the corner LMAO
Just threw a ky on the floor that was set to frame perfect DP out of blockstun
Did 60% on chip then can kill off a dp bait LOL
Also get about 70% meter after throwing someone then supering which is rad
decent, true test will be mega bomb
shopkeep has an item for buying things?
explains why i didn't know about it
i think the bot needs to take up some hobbies
i had a run where my super boots were the 10 star piece reward
Hello! Did I miss anything interesting?
Just got home from work and debated if I wanted to play rando or lay down and watch rando
I tweeted the blockstring that does 70% chip lol
Also maxes risk so if they decide to take the hit they also just fucking die
Talk about a fish out of water
Strive crossplay drops this month tho I think
So buff00n is going to get memed constantly soon
i can't wait for fighterz to get rollback soon
No game with added rollback has had good netcode yet
Blazblue and p4au have been dogshit
P4au adds 9 frames of delay on pc but it's only like a couple on ps4 for some reason
Yea p4AU on pc is bad
If people are choosing console over PC for a FG, there's something verry wrong with the pc port lol
i mean, i play fighterz on pc, and practice on switch when i'm out and about
Yea I'm hoping bandai will break the cycle
Cause it's a very wanted thing
But I've lost hope currently lol
@PaigellaMae goombario start should just mean new seed
I made an appointment for a pm64 tattoo
oh yeah, item pouches are on, i forgor
wasn't koopa leaf on rugged or was that herb?
Wait Ive never seen him come alive for a letter and then fake die again
I see you do it a lot but can you explain why you usually only do 6 rip checks?
I waste all my coins when I get blue house access like immediately
