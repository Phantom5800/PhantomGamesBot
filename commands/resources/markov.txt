i now have the english MM practice rom on my wii
english is faster for any% nmg/unrestricted for various reasons lmao
I felt that
yeah iirc english is faster for srm categories but the only one i'd run is any% unrestricted cuz it's 20 minutes long lol
definitely more interesting in nmg tho
WHOS THIS SEWER FREAK
LMAOOO
LOL

what was that sewer man what was that
yo phantom GL HF crayon38Dance
also thanks again for inviting me to do commentary, I had a blast
I was glad to have risch there, I couldn't have explained many things in that much detail LUL
hmm i will consider clicking the follow button
no
wouldn't it be funny if you got struck by lightning a third time
its comedy rules of threes, itll happen
Hai hai, you wonderful person, you. : D
I'm alright. Did I come in at a weird time? LuL
Not.. AT ALL? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Side note: I made tacos. : D
Naturally, I made enough for everyone.
Go pick that badge up, mister. >:I
Badges have feelings too.
That badge is going to be dwelling on that all day long.. like.. "Damn.. I can't believe that Luigi(?) didn't want me.. That's harsh.."
oh no...gosts
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
guess who got a raphnet today?!
and they work together!
setup was a pain
kept mapping start to hammer
don't laugh!
That flower just destroyed you, and then gave you pity money that it stole from your pocket while you were distracted.
Nice.
I just woke up tho and have to get ready for work. I'll explain more stuff later over discord
have fun gamer
Ah yes. The shyghosts.
I like that you had to go the mansion to get that.
When the game is kind-of? vanilla.
Pfffffft. Nice Sushi colors.
Haven't seen that one before.
why do you look flat
)
pokeball sushie
@gnommis Why do you look flat?
unsure
I'm kidding. Don't hate me. ; -;
In before they're all chilling in a single corner of the flower field?
Did you already hug Act 1?
Got'cha.
Right. Forgot if you can set the bridge to be down by default or not.
This is a pretty rude chapter six placement.
she water on my block til i squirt
What the **** did I just read?
The game is making you do some things that you don't want to do. LuL
Have you fought the early dojo fights?
Oh. Got'cha.
You can do it!
The real question is IF you should do it.
Nice refund.
Such a weirdly strong badge.
I had no idea how good Refund was, when I was young.
Well done!
The things we do when the seed is being rude.
Huh.
glennj5JAAMIN windows
If you have a quote bot, I'd like to petition for adding "You better have a mailman in your pocket."
-taco
Excellent.
Also, that penguin had a cloud in his cupboard.
I mean, where else do you keep your cloud turtle things?
Certainly not in the sky like a savage.
It really, really wants you to go to Bowser's Castle. KEKwait
Hahaha.
Depends on the chapter attached, I guess?
Ah.
Did we thought? Did we really?
though*
HMMMM...
Haha.
That's rough, buddy.
Thanks, windows.
Windows: Notice me, senpai. *Hides knife behind back*
My audio drivers do the big dumb every time my windows updates.
"don't tell my sister"
Clearly, you need star pieces.
He was thinking about it. I mean, everyone in this seed is, from what we've seen.
See?
Haha.
Luigi(?) has just pissed a lot of people off.
That's all.
you know what would make traps better
You ever just find a calculator out in the desert?
if it showed the same pickup animation for the item
annd then exploded
mario holds it above his head and gets struck by lightning
run ded
Oof.
I went to get a drink of water, and I missed what?
glennj5CRY
Strugglebus, here we come!
As much as I love hanging out here, I might go play some DBD soon.
I'm.. assuming? that you don't play DBD?
Got'cha.
I have severe anxiety to the point of having a heart that tries to physically end me. I don't bleeping know why I play DBD.
I wonder how many items you use on average in all of your Paper Mario seeds.
It really varies, though. 'Cause like.. sometimes it's a couple items due to good luck, and, sometimes it's... a LOT of items.
how much is power bounce?
Three?
Wow.
Attack FX Attic
I'd like to request turning on Attack FX A, in honor of this being quite A seed.
Oh neat.
Woo!
The shyguys are on something today.
HAHAHA
He was too powerful. They had to keep Kooper and his shell separate.
We can do chapter 1 now, right?
Oh gods. Imagine if the slot machine was in the pool.
I really want the piggos to be in the pool. >:I
Always Bow.
But, slapping the **** out of stuff.
lurking while driving
glennj5SWEAT dont watch stream and drive
Huh..
Why did Kooper have that?
Kooper is just an all or nothing kinda guy, you know?
He's dead, Jim.
How much is the hp plus? LuL
Oof.
fire flower must pay for what it did
Hello my darling
Hello my ragtime gal
*runs into the bomb jail break out expecting to come out of it alive
So.. what did all of these traps replace in the item pool?
Such as?
Got'cha.
random lightning strikes
These Koopa bros colors. LuL
They're like an even more scuffed version of themselves.
And that's saying something.
Time for a gamba? LuL
Dang.
Nice!
That's a welcome party.
Wow.
Haha.
Are you slowly or rapidly losing your sanity? Since it's not a question of if.
For sure. Instead of just.. "We know that we have to full clear. Let's go, auto pilot!"
Bowser's elite patrol right there.
Hahahahaha.
Squid1 propokEL propokER Squid4 propokUU
Squid1 propokEL propokER Squid4 propokJ hi
windows
good ol' Windows bullying
was good! Finished Coromon and jumped into Boyfriend Dungeon unironically Kappa
how's the rando?
What's Assumed Fill? :o
right
so a more diverse logic to items?
sweet. Love me some extra rando BloodTrail
Nice.
ez game Kappa
Five and a half hour seed?
that just means fun then :)
what's "Assumed Fill?"
oh
I watch PM Rando, I don't keep up with the development
What is assumed fill? Well.. when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much..
The easy answer for all Rando... ... "Just Hundo the Seed 4Head " Kappa
I'd like the randomize to be able to randomize the desert "area" tiles.
randomizer*
I've played enough other Randos where it's happened LUL
Chomp. :O
Oh neat.
The logic for this seed has been all over the place.
This is gonna be a long one. LuL
She's just exploding with love.
f I'm late, gl hf!
assumed already giving you a wild goose chase i see
geez
oh god is that a 'total time playing rando' timer?
im so sorry lmao
what a bro
what trap setting are you rocking
i think it's 25% of consumables then? ... something like that
booming voice there chanterelle
duude what a chain
yea okay pape, lol
was that in the cloud a maple?
dude the god combo of jump badges, what
lol, welp
you know, that tracker has a great notepad function i heard
(tbf im also really bad at taking notes)
"Oh I'll probably remember that, how could I not?" ... 10 minutes later ..
Ah. I succumbed to my taco food coma. How goes the seed?
Still no birb.
did AntiGuy ever have something for you?
aight gotta bounce, wish you that portrait soon lol
Give water stone to Lily in chapter 6?
Did you buy from Rip Cheeto?
Is it one of the vines?
Didn't they just add that you can give the artifact to Kolorado without finishing Ch2?
Assumed fill too hard so you had to cheat with glitches Kappa
Yep, that's what happens when things are actually random
no more easy runs
well, maybe some, but not most
gfg
ooh, that's a sick color for Peach
