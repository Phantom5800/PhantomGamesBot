good luck
I'm excited to try this
yoo glgl
nice peril manip
restart computer!
i now have the english MM practice rom on my wii
english is faster for any% nmg/unrestricted for various reasons lmao
I felt that
yeah iirc english is faster for srm categories but the only one i'd run is any% unrestricted cuz it's 20 minutes long lol
definitely more interesting in nmg tho
WHOS THIS SEWER FREAK
that was the best thing i've ever fucking seen
what was that sewer man what was that
yo phantom GL HF
also thanks again for inviting me to do commentary, I had a blast
I was glad to have risch there, I couldn't have explained many things in that much detail LUL
hmm i will consider clicking the follow button
wouldn't it be funny if you got struck by lightning a third time
its comedy rules of threes, itll happen
Hai hai, you wonderful person, you. :D
I'm alright. Did I come in at a weird time? LuL
Not.. AT ALL? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Side note: I made tacos. :D
Naturally, I made enough for everyone.
Go pick that badge up, mister. >:I
Badges have feelings too.
That badge is going to be dwelling on that all day long ... like ... Damn ... I can't believe that Luigi(?) didn't want me ... That's harsh ...
oh no ... gosts
guess who got a raphnet today?!
and they work together!
setup was a pain
kept mapping start to hammer
don't laugh!
That flower just destroyed you, and then gave you pity money that it stole from your pocket while you were distracted.
I just woke up tho and have to get ready for work. I'll explain more stuff later over discord
have fun gamer
Ah yes. The shyghosts.
I like that you had to go the mansion to get that.
When the game is kind-of? vanilla.
Nice Sushi colors.
Haven't seen that one before.
why do you look flat
pokeball sushie
I'm kidding. Don't hate me. ;-;
In before they're all chilling in a single corner of the flower field?
Did you already hug Act 1?
Right. Forgot if you can set the bridge to be down by default or not.
This is a pretty rude chapter six placement.
she water on my block til i squirt
What the **** did I just read?
The game is making you do some things that you don't want to do. LuL
Have you fought the early dojo fights?
Oh. Got'cha.
You can do it!
The real question is if you should do it.
Nice refund.
Such a weirdly strong badge.
I had no idea how good Refund was, when I was young.
Well done!
The things we do when the seed is being rude.
If you have a quote bot, I'd like to petition for adding "You better have a mailman in your pocket."
Also, that penguin had a cloud in his cupboard.
I mean, where else do you keep your cloud turtle things?
Certainly not in the sky like a savage.
It really, really wants you to go to Bowser's Castle. KEKwait
Depends on the chapter attached, I guess?
Did we thought? Did we really?
That's rough, buddy.
Thanks, windows.
Windows: Notice me, senpai. *Hides knife behind back*
My audio drivers do the big dumb every time my windows updates.
don't tell my sister
Clearly, you need star pieces.
He was thinking about it. I mean, everyone in this seed is, from what we've seen.
Luigi(?) has just pissed a lot of people off.
That's all.
you know what would make traps better
You ever just find a calculator out in the desert?
if it showed the same pickup animation for the item
annd then exploded
mario holds it above his head and gets struck by lightning
run ded
I went to get a drink of water, and I missed what?
Strugglebus, here we come!
As much as I love hanging out here, I might go play some DBD soon.
I'm ... assuming? that you don't play DBD?
I have severe anxiety to the point of having a heart that tries to physically end me. I don't bleeping know why I play DBD.
I wonder how many items you use on average in all of your Paper Mario seeds.
It really varies, though. 'Cause like ... sometimes it's a couple items due to good luck, and, sometimes it's ... a LOT of items.
how much is power bounce?
Attack FX Attic
I'd like to request turning on Attack FX A, in honor of this being quite A seed.
Oh neat.
The shyguys are on something today.
He was too powerful. They had to keep Kooper and his shell separate.
We can do chapter 1 now, right?
Oh gods. Imagine if the slot machine was in the pool.
I really want the piggos to be in the pool. >:I
Always Bow.
But, slapping the **** out of stuff.
lurking while driving
dont watch stream and drive
Why did Kooper have that?
Kooper is just an all or nothing kinda guy, you know?
He's dead, Jim.
How much is the hp plus? LuL
fire flower must pay for what it did
Hello my darling
Hello my ragtime gal
runs into the bomb jail break out expecting to come out of it alive
so ... what did all of these traps replace in the item pool?
Such as?
random lightning strikes
These Koopa bros colors. LuL
They're like an even more scuffed version of themselves.
And that's saying something.
Time for a gamba? LuL
That's a welcome party.
Are you slowly or rapidly losing your sanity? Since it's not a question of if.
For sure. Instead of just ... "We know that we have to full clear. Let's go, auto pilot!"
Bowser's elite patrol right there.
good ol' Windows bullying
was good! Finished Coromon and jumped into Boyfriend Dungeon unironically Kappa
how's the rando?
What's Assumed Fill? :o
so a more diverse logic to items?
sweet. Love me some extra rando BloodTrail
ez game Kappa
Five and a half hour seed?
that just means fun then :)
what's Assumed Fill?
I watch PM Rando, I don't keep up with the development
What is assumed fill? Well ... when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much..
The easy answer for all Rando ... ... Just Hundo the Seed 4Head Kappa
I'd like the randomizer to be able to randomize the desert "area" tiles.
I've played enough other Randos where it's happened LUL
Chomp. :O
Oh neat.
The logic for this seed has been all over the place.
This is gonna be a long one. LuL
She's just exploding with love.
f I'm late, gl hf!
assumed already giving you a wild goose chase i see
oh god is that a 'total time playing rando' timer?
im so sorry lmao
what a bro
what trap setting are you rocking
i think it's 25% of consumables then? ... something like that
booming voice there chanterelle
duude what a chain
yea okay pape, lol
was that in the cloud a maple?
dude the god combo of jump badges, what
lol, welp
you know, that tracker has a great notepad function i heard
tbf I'm also really bad at taking notes
Oh I'll probably remember that, how could I not? ... 10 minutes later ...
Ah. I succumbed to my taco food coma. How goes the seed?
Still no birb.
did AntiGuy ever have something for you?
aight gotta bounce, wish you that portrait soon lol
Give water stone to Lily in chapter 6?
Did you buy from Rip Cheeto?
Is it one of the vines?
Didn't they just add that you can give the artifact to Kolorado without finishing Ch2?
Assumed fill too hard so you had to cheat with glitches Kappa
Yep, that's what happens when things are actually random
no more easy runs
well, maybe some, but not most
ooh, that's a sick color for Peach
lurking cuz driving
nice gold Kappa
is this WABITR?
you love to see it
good luck with your first run that totally won't be able to watch
brace yourself, I've acquired Malort's
gl gamer
ngl I was surprised to find out that there are 10 falzar runs
"I don't know what Malort's is" you will come CB
you WILL
bop the boss Pog
not yet
you can put it in if you want
it's good vs diveman and aquaman
yeah it's better if it's A code
yeah trnarrw code doesn't matter in gregar
Wait, you're playing Falzar?
you can use it on elementman
in pav3
Welp time to wait for yet another cable
There's no display port so time to spend 50 bucks on a usb converter
I just want my fucking monitor so I can do anything I want to
what do you mean there is no display port and no functional hdmi
That literally wont work
the pc doesn't have it
there is 2 hdmi and a dvi
God I'm dumb they were fuckin plugged
Thank you for curing stupidity for me
yoo good luck my dude!
I believe in you
most importantly
weed mario believes in u
just imagine him with a thumbs up instead of a hand on his hip
my clip finger was ready
I love falzar for that reason. can't brute force it
thus far, Falzar seems like pain
I love it
spoutman is amazing. drip drip
do you have splits inside your splits?? sick
Why would you want it earlier when you could have it now
wait what the fuck are you
olimar lookin ass
Lance pog
it's Aquaman, or SpoutMan, cuz Capcom USA didn't want to get sued
good call
man, I love watching MegaMan just SWOOCE all over the place
you got robbed with that ElementTrap
GG yess. good job
yaa it is hard to tell at first
on a phone call, lurking
PBs were built on hope
or whatever the saying is. glgl
good evening phantom, GL HF
huh ... on my screen your name is exacltly 0.5 pixels wider than mine.
never noticed it was that close
I tried to click on you and twitch took me to the browse category list
Twitch dont want me here
ok so the one use of this tech for wario so far
huh ... now that you mention it ... yeah it is
Is nair combos like 5% longer
But we could already do that lol
Back in my day, we had to click on streams uphill both ways
The input is free at least
It's just fuck up a halfcircle by one number lol
I randomly woke up at 3am, so here I am LUL
I went to bed at 22:30 like a responsible adult *shudder*
did you find out the milk was bad before you had some?
late night gang
oh good
I've found out the milk went bad the wrong way before
would not recommend
I think I could use this for zard but that's like it lol
cause the full momentum nair input only works on nair so I could use this for back air or something
reset then
I missed half of it
wait you can just gold the button for text boxes? Must be nice Kappa
as it should be, really
Rune factory does that :)
although the way BN does it also makes a lot of sense
5 I might actually figure out a route for, the storyline seems MUCH better to run and I actually have movement tech to work with from shortswords
Shortsword charge attacks break movement it's so fun
If you do it off a hill you keep full momentum of your dash and the gravity is so low that you just go so fucking far
Hai hai.
Hai grumpypants?
You seem like you're having a time.
Oh okay. Haha.
gold though
Pape 64 (REAL)
All around me are familiar faaaces, worn out plaaaceeessss
pay the penalty
oh were we predicting? LUL
uh, sorry my phone bugged out I definitely meant 3,3,3
blame it on autocorrect
Tell us of this plan of yours.
Oh good.
What could possibly go wrong? Four hours of work, all with the possibility of catastrophic failure that could have been avoided?
that sounds horrible
speedrunners man
built differently
The self abuse.
It's fine. You've got this. First try, new PB.
I don't know if I'd still run BN if Gregar was a 50-50 LUL
But it feels longer. LuL
hmm yeah, that's a big difference
it's okay, there's plenty of time to bounce back
so at worst it's a coin flip for a PB
Congrats on the WR.
wait what
Do you think that a skip directly into the final chapter is theoretically possible? Via, I dunno, glitching into loads zones and such?
damn, that coin flip saves a lot of time Kappa
Like ... hidden under levels and such.
Just some void?
It has to be somewhere.
I love speedy spin
rip run Sadge
Ok after fiddling with the "tech" for a bit I never drop it because it's just a timed half circle and I'm only gonna use it on zard lol
Puts his tail behind him in like 2 frames so kinda want that
So, if chapter five has said trigger glitch, then ... surely the other chapters have un-discovered loadzones too?
I get that, but like, even the card has to be stored somewhere. The loadzone attached to the card is stored somewhere.
Sorry if I'm being annoying about it, but, I refuse to believe that it's impossible.
Not with that attitude.
I can now down throw up smash with zard but like
why the fuck would I ever do that
bthrow bair is same damage better position and bthrow nair sets up for 0 to death lol
I dunno. It took them like ... 20 years to skip the WW barrier.
ACE is busted
That's pretty fun.
Is there any tech in this game that is similar to a lot of the Zelda game's extended bomb boost jumps?
Also hate gimrs video because he puts a part that says "Shotos can do this" and you know what char type he doesnt show
Terry has no shoryu fireball or tatsu
Well I guess rising tackle is kind of a shoryu now in 15 but not in smash
I drank all of my orange juice, and now I'm sad. ;-; It's all gone.
Correction: I chugged all of my orange juice because it was too tasty, and I couldn't help myself.
What did Chomp ever do to you? D:
You monster.
One time is one too many. >.>
Nicely done!
Hey gl on the runs!
such a long category props to you
OH SWEET! that means alot :)
definitely LUL People usually run the pc or N64 emu version
Maybe this could help with THIS waft confirm
Thought to myself then I do it and it works if I do it perfect
But then I did it just with a dash and it worked better LOL
ok the one thing it would do is make jablock waft easier
because I dont have to do my jump input frame perfect
Void is tweeting clips of it and it's just him shitting on people who aren't anti-airing him and doing a b reverse
If I do this jaemi is going to dragdown forward air me and I am dead
fuck falco
The only useful things I've seen so far are helping bad turnaround animations and diddy kong can dtilt z drop banana if he picks it up with dtilt
But like any safe air you'd hit a shield with point blank you have a positive on the rps anyway so unless your dashback NEEDS it then why do it lol
warios dashback for example is mad fucking good because he lifts his ass up and leans immediately and his feet dont exist lol
GOLD gold
ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOUR SOUL
I'd love if you had this
cuz if you could select from 3 random items, I think that'd be hilarious
which of these items does Mario hate, Princess?:
true, that in itself is fun
Kammy places Goombario in front of chest
gl gl phanto274Bless
It's summer heat already where I live
Nicely done.
Did you draw your splits background?
Oh I see it nice
They're adding what for artists?
Oh that's pretty cool
I was born in 95 monkaS
yooo phantom gl on the run!! phanto274Bless
did you end up getting milk??
Also i hate chapter 5 Madge
not that guy. he killed my run earlier
I need to work on this chapters movement specifically.
All aboard the strugglebus!
ty for stream phantom!! Hope to catch the next one soon! peepoWave
I had a fright jar fail, jumped on fire bar, got speedied and a pokey encountered me when I was trying to bombette first strike :)
Ah. I live
I'm ... on hope
Right. Forgot if you were fuckin plugged
As much is amazing. drip
huh ... on my darling
dont want the follow button
I went to click on a drink of yours.
She's just imagine him with that
This is amazing. drip drip drip drip
One time my wii
Hey I'm driving home, so can't talk. good luck
Hopped on quickplay cause I just wanted to play and this mario was just mashing the rar shit so I went zard
He didn't live very long
he put himself at backair tipper range every time LOL
I also refuse to call this the gimr or any of the names he gave it because it's just a control stick angle lol
Yea you just corner notch after an initial dash
If you flick it you go back and if you dont you just drift in it's not really anything new lolll
Anything I've tested with this I do with just an attack cancel or full momentum nair or even just a dash and it's the same thing LOL
The only thing I'd use this for is for like fullhop back airs because you can't attack cancel that
Yea that's what I do for my bike look wavebounces
I went to the alt account to check follow requests and an anime tab pops up and it's just some cosplay girls ass
This is why I never have home page on
I literally only follow RF artists on that account and it's like 10 of them lol
I just followed like 10 artists I like most on that account so my timeline is only that and nothing else
Since that account is just for annoyed rambling I may as well have something I want to see while I'm there lol
doing a normal run i see
We should rando race sometime now that my pc wouldn't explode for it
yeah gl
what is top 15 rn?
really? damn. slopdop was top 10 when I started my grind
thank you for harnessing bad rng, it may help with the decision to run tonight
I have never recovered from absorbing morphs rng to get any% record
yeah, I would've gotten 3:46 probably
my rng is still godawful after that
i bought so much shit today!!!
mini min amiibo
monkey ball banana mania
network transmission
and a logitech litra
most recent, i got it on PS5 for 20 bucks
you will one day KEKW
I can join the next NT race LUL
EzekielSD : Alright so ... arbitrary code execution, you can jump into the blue house? And y'all got Clippy? EzekielHD : Yeah. EzekielSD : The future is crunk! EzekielHD : Anything else you wanna know? EzekielSD : Is Final Bowser too much? Am I ready? EzekielHD : I can't tell you everything. But if you want to make history, you got to charge your own jumps. EzekielSD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD + EzekielHD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD : We going to the volcano!
yeah, last one had a turn out for 7 runners
its only hard in the beginning
Ah Phantom5800, I see that you've included the partner Goombario in your party. However, I see that he's also surrounded by other trash partners. Instead why not use Goombario, the best partner in Paper Mario? It opens you up to some real all-star attacks, like Tattle and Multibonk.
Dear Twitch User Phantom5800: I noticed your chat does not contain the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. I have decided it is best to add this pasta to your chat forthwith rather than unfollow. Again, the pasta I am adding to your chat is the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. Thank You.
phantom, its happening phanto274Hype
Bored Ape #1398 Owner says buying NTFs was Biggest Regret of his life. He is unable to sell it for even a fraction of what he spent, it financially ruined him.
The collapse begins guys ...

also gl, sorry i had to get some pastas out
you gonna continue bird up or just a one and done?
thought about doing an unboxing for the litra
imagine doing unboxing for lighting without any lighting KEKW

Hai hai. :D
Bad. >:(
Grumpy bad, though.
So, it's manageable.
I see that you are pulling out all of the tricks for this.
20 bp
not possible
I'm aware.
I'm memeing.
i think 8 is most unless I'm forgetting a thing

this sounds like every rando race i've asked about lmao
holy shit that charge

i was ready for the big dumb attack but forgot the little clouds take his turn if you die
did u save yoshi's?
but what if the yoshis have weed for mario
buy goombario
mario needs that
what if partner attacks are randomized? like bomb is headbonk and headbonk is waterblock and waterblock is bom
komari is disappointed in you
"I dont really care about bird" KEKW
i mean someone had to say it
im going to head out and watch rest on vod

I've beat his ass in 3 parking lots now
i'm calling the police rn

on phantom for killing children
you threw it at jr
it's not about using it
that's funny af
it was on jr that is the problem
just time out
up and away him
just fright jar him
probably dink anyways
there should be a setting that puts good badges in out of the way places
mod bp plus so it can randomly take more than it gives
The Skollar Smooch is Hilarious
I think a nut animation specifically on bowser would be better
bowser can u not
4/20 lmao
wait sorry this is serious
shield 4 turns in a row bowser

if you tried to brute force your way with everything else you would have died
just 3 stocked Elite Smash Aegis. Thrice in a row.
the 1st three stock, I'm morally obligated to give a runback
the 2nd, I felt bad
the 3rd, I moved on
I mean, I'd want a runback if I got 3-stocked
be the change you wanna see in the world
start with the man in the mirror
we talking about YGO?
yeah there needs to be best of 3 to understand some counterplay
one game benefits shitters, who'll gladly dip after one game
I still think it's hilarious that there's like very few cards in Yu-Gi-Oh that say, "what's that, I beat you in a single game and you're expecting more? NOPE!!! I JUST WIN THE ENTIRE MATCH THERE AND THEN!" and then victory dragon proceeded to be banned.
I don't fathom how people willingly dip from a close game, and a stable connection
"Damn, they got me. I'll get them on the runback- !? THIS MF'ER LEFT!"
it's last stock, both of us kill% and dude LEAVES cuz they got their W on a rando???
fuck outta here
I wanna play
It's the Super Prologue Bros.
damn prologue just started
there are worst prologues, admittedly
imagine having to sit through KH2's prologue every time you wanted to do a run
KH2 I can skip cutscenes
@Ohrocks but you can't skip the tutorials
they gotta make sure you're alive still after skipping the cutscenes
uh... art is cool
we missed prologue Sadge
i got 3:07:58 with race rules
kinda surprised
i don't think we'll be seeing any more sub 3s with assumed fill
oh ya i meant with race rules
I almost forgot the good luck weed
with glitches and coincidences some pretty wild stuff could happen
now you wont get speedied
Look earlier I told monado that the freeform jazz would make early bobbery work and then it did so
@TacoGuyy "good luck weed" should I pop an edible, for luck?
Do it
Alright I'm gonna go do a windwaker run to yolo a pb before I say fuck this game again
Dog island as a grind game sounds painful with the rng
edible has been popped
you have to PB now
it's the rule
Alright gl on the rest time to remind myself why I'm dropping a game quick
believe in the weed
@TacoGuyy later mate
also yes
someone @ me in 10 minutes for another gl w speedy
turtle soup
damn you, badge man
hello there phantom :F
saw your last run rip bowser fight
ill get behind cursed cart
I'm saving up so i can make you a rando seed :D
i'm on a good way 4.3k
do you want to know the number tho?
it's not been that bad phantom
i dont know if I've ever seen you actually get 1st try speedy
i did not know the record any% of this game is 1h 41m 02s
yeah its morph
wiiu is a 1:41:07
cool rigby is on the list
he is on 82
it looks like a fun route
huh i wonder what happened that cost you 35 seconds in this run
i guess we'll never know
well good luck i'm heading out it's 4 in the morning for me so time for bed :D
quite a controller scheme
oh that is dope
thanks phantom have fun with the run
i used to do that playing casually on wii
i was a spin masher even when i was bad
gosh i sure have
really arent selling running this in anything other than rando
you know what's funny though
it's only the good runs lmao
everything usually is fine if I'm playing like shit
i haven't had everything line up for a while
oh dear
do you have the fight memorized?
welcome to my 3:43:55
it was my biggest mistake in that run
other than getting double dink
honestly, thinking of it that way, 51 second diff
20 of it was boo portrait 20 was double dink
my current pb is barely better than my old one
im a nobody now axlsenCoward
i lost jcog vip F
run is looking pretty good so far
how the fuck did i mess up that bad
go fast
going fast PridePog
nm, how are you?
good ol' gambling speedrun Kappa
but Mario always wins. That has to count for something
wow no tailers
shockingly it landed heads
ez moneys
though I did bet so I can't end the prediction
welp time to wait a day
there is more than one of us
gl gl
gl gl
had a good any% run
awesome speedrun
yo raids
hi taco
That game is dead to me
whats good taco
Procced phantom ganon in ff2 so couldn't door clip and just decided I don't really care that much to keep going
No I didn't even get there lol
Triggered the miniboss so I couldn't go up there without being stopped
And can't kill him because no master sword
You get master sword from ganondorf cutscene
He gives you the weapon to kill him :)
I should make a layout for pape rando and fuck around with that tbh
For when I'm learning ori to still do something
Rando has been fun and I can LZS so it wouldn't be glitchless
that bee makes weed mario sad
I made a weedmario command in my chat and named it mxfour since they made my name theirs
what won
heads or ass
this is hands down my favorite ascii art
I sent you what it actually looks like
yo glgl
hi lips
you were akari
you should mash a+b as the battle fades out after your hurricane, it ends the battle faster
it applies to any fight where you gain 0 xp
weird game
weren't we wondering if it just applied to every fight period for a while
yeah we were but I feel like it's only true for 0 XP fights
could be wrong tho
EZ Clap
I do better when I'm looking at my controller vs looking at screen
for do a regular speedrun can I redeem hammer% KEKW
i wanna see you suffer though
Actually I don't want that lemme refund myself LOL
he IS doing a regular speedrun smh
that one marathon you did months ago did
I dont wanna see anyone do 3D world any% doesnt look interresting
And you told them No :)
3d world any% is only cool to me with the movement jank but like nobody does it because it's brutally hard to keep consistent with getting stars
Just get a perfect bowser
Do what jcog did that other night ezpz
well then do the equivalent
taco, check #general
mario to min min LUL
once we get sora I can finally stop monkaS
I think it's best to not get the sora one
don' acknowledge his existence
I was so relived once I got bayo "its finally over" Then Ulitimate got teased. "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!"
just nut on bowser again
I don't like the frame of him looking left
I dont wanna post that one anymore
mario threw a tantrum
he wanted to kill that koopa
Bowser pls phanto274Bless
monkaS someone pls
i dunno anything
bowser give peril phanto274Bless
yoo GG
Pb is a PB congrats!
random! peepoWave
Jen! peepoWave
lets go rng
top 20 BLANKIES
There's Mitzi, Gengar, Rigby
Did you get speedied this run
stop doing that
good luck on runs
me and Taco just find out that Ultimate Doubles is a side-event at CB
Team with proc coward
go 0-2 with the monkey
Yea it's a matter of if you like have a friend you wanna team with or just a static
I'm sorry for that showing at PP
That's the teams I play against around here I can fuck those up
I also play wario so that helps lol
no dink pls
we'll see when speedy is first
they lost a lifeshroom to an encounter and didnt want to try LP
we go AGAIN
glgl peepoComfy
you got it this time MarioDab
but... we love prologue Kappa
Played superhot for a bit
Bumped into my closet several times and now I'm very tired
but vr works so that's cool
Esam is remaking his discord rn
And he's trying to justify his mistake
that's 6.8 seconds too many time to reset
glgl Prayge
yeah this run looks really hot
in defricken green
don't ban me taco
i just assume hes here and waiting to ban me
was playing unite with people
game is still bad but last patch actually made it much better
score shield and buddy barrier both got TURBO nerfed
so its a much more engage-heavy meta
still some broken shit
and the game itself is like... built by toddlers
but its fun
Almost as hot as goompa
lol gless suffering
ah it makes sense, you want a good time, not to *have* a good time
im jk gless is fun
i mean that's pape for you. both this and ttyd
gless is jsut ch2 and 3 suffering in ttyd yeah
yeah its like 2+ hours in
after ch3 gless is basically just purely execution
ch2 is fine except when punie jumps just dont work for no reason
my gless pb has a mere 30 minute major league
has a 26 minute wr
lol major league be like that sometimes
like 70% of major league is literally just learning alternate fights
yeah, it's a great route to finish a run
my pb is only 6:39 so it's not even good lol
yeah, that's why i had to stop running it. when even sway takes 6 hours it's just too much
the tricks in TTYD are ridiculous
AND its 60 fps
if i had unlimited time i'd rather run that than pape i think, but i don't
the biggest difference, by a gigantic margin, is b for text vs mashing
Doing a run today also :D
i enjoy speed swapping, but i could see why people wouldn't
that was fast
the biggest problem with speedswapping is having to explain it to literally every viewer
speedswapping with peach is just goofy lol *wigglewigglewiggle*
I ... hate spm. I don't enjoy that game at all.
Don't tell spm people, they will hurt me
the start of this game makes me sadge for speedrunners
im feel for you
origami king was a bad game, agreed
how did the koopa brother's get to the bowser castle and so fast down?
imagine a basically on-rails 20 minute prologue regardless of category
maybe they jumped?
and the sunshine runners thought their prologue was bad enough to romhack it
have you used that pipe in any rando?
i know there is a big difference, i'm just memeing
yeah, sms runners are insane
when do you think the next rando is?
But also sms runners are *insane* the top level play of that game is ridiculous
if i had points i could make you one :D
just wait for plando and that reward
As mean as m4 seed the other night that needed to get ultra hammer, to get ultra boots, to get kooper in toy box, to get diamond stone in volcano, to beat ch2?
hmm maybe i should do a rando, i could if i start right now
quadruple?? lmao
what do vip?
bye goombario you will not be missed
dang it
"sigh" fine but only that fight
what fight?
presumably works because jr will just slap you over and over until you do enough damage
yay for not dinking
they work for bowser and are also scared of him hehe
whoever figured out to put fright jars in this game and ttyd is an asshole btw
they're more polarized. more 90+ and more < 5s too
yeah, that one is a thing
the worst fight in glitz is shy guys. cuz with 4 enemies, anything under 95% is gonna miss a lot. and those dudes steal items
i will be back later good luck with the run
poor bombette getting slapped
yoo gl
3rd try incoming
have you just had this 2nd cart lying around lmao
i should check around me to see if there's any local stores like that now that i'm not a bum
probably yeah
not spoodlied
so excited you did lil jumps of joy for the seed
you go REAL slow with js lol
the ! shows up, you pause a full 4 seconds
i've definitely triple jumped at locks in hooktails castle before
don't forget jumping on the furniture
it's very nice indeed
got nothing to do so here i am
and i do love paper mario so
think you forgot to jump :D
jumping in front of chests now too, really spicing it up
hammer time
well so far your doing good :D
wish i was good at speedrunning
i feel like the japanse version has lower health on the bosses
dew it :3
oh no it's bowow
when i was a kid i did not like this chapter
was to scary :3
did not like the ghosted
i can finally do equip swap in mm now, getting closer to doing runs soon
fuck this boo
It's impossible to learn a second character when jesse refuses to play anything but my wario
i have to relearn snowhead tho cuz we skip fire arrow entirely now
And with the delay we have from distance I don't wanna fucking play wario
we also skip light arrow but we get it through gim in great bay which is cool
so you never go into regular stone tower
also hi taco
wifi sucks
Like the 2nd wario set there were so many times where i was right but it had to be tight movement because of my char
And then I see the ad startup or roll and I just die at 90 because the DI is for the roll
Hi morph
What if it's just some hot hoes likin what they see
Yea they're wet for good PB's
@TacoGuyy he can't escape your Wario at the AirBnB
yo glgl
yo glgl
was good, brushed up on a few things
@buff00n I literally just want to play a secondary I want to have extra chars for a couple matchups I loathe but kinda can't learn them if he won't play them with things that aren't his shitty ass wifi chars
i know it all too well Sadge
Like I don't give a fuck about the PT sora matchup on wifi that char is fake
gonna get some food and lurk, glgl man Prayge
Also literally the only reason I stopped playing pit
He refuses to ever play it with anything
So I just can't play pit against good players
Like the chars I'm trying to play are all good chars that I play offline
wonder what the bed smell's like?
dreams and tubba sweat
broken dreams
He uses old spice deodorant and he thinks that's all he needs so he doesn't shower
Hence why there's no bathroom in the mansion
and where can you get a talking key i want one
Yea mario is too busy doing this shit
So the toads shit in the bushes
why do you think that green one refuses to cooperate
He's mad at mario
I assume you got speedied
well well well :D
oh rip
let's hope you don't die then
if it's okay ask how do i become moderator?
okay :D
Buff00n's a bastard
I will join that club in october or whenever the fuck port is
Uhhh let's check the modview tab
Roguedarkjedi and aladd
Idk who they are but they're mods
And phantomgamesbot, the best mod
When will phantomgamesbot be allowed to violence post publicly
Let's feed him good
Let him weed mario
This is injustice
that's dope
Ok brb I'm being dragged to a dinner when I already ate
you will like when you move out i lived alone since i was 18 now i'm 22
i went out of state so i will be in debt forever
no encounter so we good
yeah it's really comfy
as long as you dont jump in front of the chests like 4 times it's good
ah yeah true
the timing without the trage is really weird, m4, morph, and myself were doing right side door since that's usually fine in hurricane but in spook it's really awkward and you get encountered sometimes
yeah pretty much
YEP YEP
YEP YEP YEP
YEP YEP
Lantern ghost FrogeRiot
being real on twitch is cool
are you gonna be doing risky final from now on?
yeah fair
it's a duskull though, better send it back
but that's not a Dusclops next to me, and he's good until he gets knocked off
Dusknoir makes me so sad
yeah, it's got some good looks and it's decent as a tank/spin blocker. But like you said, clops is just better
"I guess I'll shadow sneak"
does it have pursuit?
Marowak-A is scary af in trick room
is it not available now in DP due to the Home update? I haven't kept up
didn't even get BDSP
well, ORAS added the primal reversion mechanic, wheras BDSP didn't really add any new mechanics, did it?
heard you like Houndour!
I was thinking Simisear, but that was BW
yeah, they're meant to be early game bridges to help you clear the early gyms
if you chose your starter poorly
beeg circle
800mg of copium
strimmer with the false advertising. Was promised top 15
time to git gud then
phanto274Sip COPIUM
uncapped too EZ
early cycle is like 16s
the spam A quiz?
Hows the run lookin
Just be fast
we love jank
just don't get stung EZ
what's good?
today is one of those BEST DAYS EVER
so after 2 weeks the 230 everdrive didn't ship so I canceler
found a listing on ebay for 250 I was sitting on
woke up from nap and he dropped it to 170
and it has already shipped!
it's an X5
don't forget
ebay chargers 10% too
so if I got it for 100 he's only making 50 bucks
I have no interest in GBA since I just emu everything
but I get it
I only stream bizhawk in obs
could ask bn guys, Kirby could prob help
gl on rest of run; time for din din
Just won a 500 ping strive game ama
GL ANYWAY PHANTOM, GEEZ
No otherwise I wouldn't have won
It was baiken so they also couldn't do shit LOL
think i will head out gl Phantom you got this
lunch is over so gotta run. I'd like to do a glitchless rando
hard part is over jcogDab
GL my guy
hiiii I haven't watched a run of this game since at least 5 years idk wtf is happening lol
I never seen that attack tbh lolo
that tells you how outdated my knowledge on that run is
same deal with watching bug fables, the key item get is my general notif tone on pc so it gets me everytime
text tone is medal get from bug fables
so you'll run bn5 to get more rng until you get back to pm64 :)
can you
go fast
so dont do that
+28 parakarry HmmCouncil
huh i wonder what happened
my downright is suddenly so far down that I can't do early whale anymore
i found out by holding up of down right and still ending up in bounds in a run like 4 times in a row
i was -1:04 and lost 3 minutes so i just called it
i need to drop ruins jump but I'm too stubborn
help lmfao
my values arent very good for it anymore with my stick
well i figured it out
i used to be able to do it 30x in a row but i cant anymore lmao
hope it doesn't change again by tomorrow
being conservative with assuming i lose some time but not a fuckton to the rest of my splits i could've 3:10ed that run
eugh lmao
nvm it still only loses 3s to fail and use para vs not going for it
i hate this game lmao
i would still not do it unless my success rate was like 90% tbh
my mentality has changed a lot
i used to never miss this shit but my controller now is bad for it
so I'm half considering dropping it
oh i should see if my controller can do it with these diagonals
it's actually extra bad
got home early from work. GL GL phanto274Smile
yo mitzi
6:23 is hype
double mood
you look like a glitch guy
what are you doin'
welp i just got ruins jump 10x in a row remapping neutral
guess I'm doing that now Sadge
it doesnt even save 2 seconds OMEGALUL
such a silly trick
i feel like if you have to remap neutral for a trick
it probably doesn't belong in gless lmfao
this specific thing is fine imo but that just sounds so sketch
you shouldnt have to, my controller is just bad
one advantage of oem
my theory is that having higher range makes the jump easier
you will never remap neutral on accident
ive done that before trying to rebadge out of a spin
i think with my current stick it's frame perfect but it'd definitely not frame perfect if i remap
while gripping my controller
im fairly certain gc has really high range
so does hori but my hori's angles are super horrible for ruins jump i havent even come close with hori
i just realized that my struggling with bts recently is probably the same angle shift that fucked my whale
i should've known this was gonna happen
what are your cardinals
press start
press start again
and then do the test
that's fairly standard tbh
there's a newer version of the rom
that shows diagonals and has other benchmarks and stuff
up and down are a little off center but otherwise solid
a brand new oem typically has 85s for cardinals
anything 80+ is considered pretty good
all of my cardinals are 80+ except for left, which is 75
so that means my upleft and downleft are more up/down than left
gameplay is improving, ggs
yo glgl
get away phantom while you still can
pape is not worth it
gotta dip for now but hope your fright jars are scary and your spins are speedy Prayge
TIFF MADE THE PERFECT Pepega SHAPE ON ACCIDENT
IT'S SO GOOD
I'll send it on disc with the emote it's so perfect
Also gl
Just don't get speedied and kill everyone perfectly
I love the song that repeats itself every 15 seconds!!!!
Yo turn it up this shit goes hard
fuck it's over
Mario Slander is Cringe He's just as awesome as all the other Super Mario Characters, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'basic'. FREAKING LOVE MARIO!1!1!>:(
should've made it Wario to prevent the ban
Wario Slander is Cringe He's way more awesome than all the other Nintendo, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'hot as fuck'. FREAKING LOVE WARIO!1!1!>:(
I hope 'hot as fuck' gets used by your bot soon
Goomnut on these bitches
what'd arie do
I should probably setup the new monitor so I can see the m4 chat
Chat loaded and I just see "c o r r u p t i o n"
How hard is the 2nd part
I know the first is fp
Very cool
heyo glgl
gl gl
Thanks! SO CLOSE bepisCry
just makes me want it that much more
that's like ONE encounter I cry
first run of the night? :D
I wish there was some pape in the sgdq lineup
Pape so comfy. Would be great for gdq
stop and swap is different
what is stop and swap?
Imagine how much better the world would be if those bills were just all at once on a pattern
I will EAT a Fright Jar if this run PBs. I will crack the lid with my teeth and suck out all of that sweet fright juice. Then, I'll insert the jar in my mouth and begin crunching. Once it has been reduced to several sharp chunks, I will unleash it into my unsuspecting stomach. After that, it's up to my doctor. That is how confident I am that this run is dead.
this song goes so hard
hggGun ok
tf: give him speedy
youtube viewers modCheck
they'd have my back
I'm down
I like glitches
Bro there's nothing attached just do the funny jumps
we do a lil pondering
Count the frames lazy ass
you got speedied with speedy in hand
glitched rando is cool, even if i can really only do LP skip, some laki clips, and maybe bhs
so cute
THEIR NOSES ARE SO BUG
I WANNA BOOP EM
definitely a big head code
AND THERES BIRDS
my ovaries oh my lord what is this masterpiece
AS YOU SHOULD
oh my

WHAT AN OLD MAN DOG
these game devs knew what was up. Dog content is the best bepisLoveCat
absolute downgrade
we need to go back
absolutely adorable
milk man looks like... he would sell you Adderall
for sure
doggy Adderall
this game deserves an award
speedrun requires you to be nekkid?
gotta feel the breeze
man so I guess theres no public indecency laws on dog island
dog village
dog world
the way your doggo runs
oh no the sad doggo music
wow what a sham of a dog doc
we do all of this for our bro?
the deck looks clean already tho
D: i guess I'm blind
DOGGO GOES FISHING?
straight bangers this game has
I would reset this game just cause i could
listen to that intro again
Which of these fuckers is making the deck dirty
fuck the mailman

@buff00n Buff00n needs an ego boost before I shit on him at combo breaker
TacoGuyy refuses to let me know peace
Simply don't lose
Also I have 66.9k channel points rn
@buff00n tbh, we're prolly gonna do drunk Ganon dittos
Why is it in Japanese? I'm surprised the words ain't in English
You can probably put it to English in settings I think???
I grew up playing this game I chose a golden retriever
Oh that's awesome!
To match amalia?
As I understand it if your a female the victory gang is your romantic interests but if your male amalia is one but who else
I did all the quests lol also poor Peter he's in love with amalia
Er princely paws I guess lol
I did know
Who's it supposed to go to though?
I wonder if your female if Alex can be a love interest
He was my favorite because when I was a kid I loved his riddles
Camu is one so is McCoy I don't know if there's a third
Are u playing wii now?
Hell yes I agree
Imagine if they included the actual animal of the crab and it could pinch your pups nose
I find it a shame that not a lot of people play this anymore it was a really adorable and fun game
I never liked Petz 2 or 1 for that matter
I preferred the dog island
Do you wanna hear something funny
The night before I got this game I dreamed of cute dogs and running around through a meadow the next day dad gave me a random wii game and this was it
I was like 11 I'm 23 now and I still love this game
How many speed runs are there for this game?
A shame honestly..
Scooby doo cyber chase was a fun game
Cyber chase was my first game on ps2 I ever played scooby doo was a fun game
Cute giraffe :3
They really had fun working on the cute aspect of this game huh?
I got distracted, where in the story are we?
Got it
Another ps 2 game I loved was 102 Dalmatians
It's old really old lol
Strong puppy ^^

Cronos won anyway because nikita

the flowers were so nice
I miss Boris every day
YO THERE'S A FLOWER
I love emotes like this because it puts mobile viewers through hell
Chikorita I like this emote
This emote is based

Chikorita gg
Oh I was literally typing for you to raid sway LOL
I was not expecting to enjoy this game as much as I did
I have that on the other tab
This game is lit
thank you for showing me this
Where's the milk he went to get
Fuck this guy
the whining noise is killing me
Whine ... aww
oh its a glitched rando today?
ah fair, glgl anyway
but.. why, discord people? i can only do a few that matter and it's still neat to do/try

I don't mean gdq
it's basically E3
all the companies are going to big there even Microsoft and Sony but not Nintendo
Did you go back and get the star piece in the flowers?
What do you think of Coney's current stream title
it's very good
That's how weed mario was born
"Sorry dear, I just rolled THE WORST blunt."
At least you're not in peril currently
Wow this is a LONG long speedrun
Nice job again on GDQ yesterday btw!
I was thinking about doing it sometime later this week
Will they post your run btw or should we like archive it?
Ok cool
i didnt get past speedy
i only did 3 attempts tho
yeah i saw that lmao
i've been watching while i was in prologue
is this glundo?
who redeemed this!?
also whats good
i got a 1 minute gold on knightman today, crazy how easy it is to save time when you derust
to get familiar again
dalus and I are doing commentary on komari's run
they asked me to do it, was glad to have carpal tunnel excuse ready. Dont wanna get on a stage like that
finding energy to stream has been hard for me recently
I just feel tired all the time
like I was off yesterday and still didnt go live
FUCK GOOMBA ROAD
consistent is my favorite word
my expansion pak has shipped so ill be able to practice soon
also send me a seed for what you think my first rando should be
its gonna be a train wreck, havent really played beyond chapter 5 LMAO
cant be worse than laichan phanto274Shrug
poor girl, she has been live for 1 and a half hours and only has boo portrait, and 2 seeds
you hate to see it
all badges, star pieces, and.... tattles KEKW
oh receipies
submit this for really really long a thon
I came up with some new BN23 head canon today
Arashi's mission to gas Yai was to get funds so they could hire Dusk to attack yumland and electopia :mindblown:
what do you do before chapter 8?
basically everything?
[all the side quests] axlsenS
do you max partners too?
bowser cheats
he gets a buff and attacks on the same turn
he uses the star rod to make mario skip a turn OMEGALUL
fun stuff?
do you save all of quizmo for now or do you do some on the way?
whats in goomba village
I was about to meme about all the mushroom in the inn, then I realized this is vanilla OMEGALUL
imagine knowing this game well enough to run glundo in jpn
Coney is watching strikers gameplay and it looks very... dull
It looks very slow
GL, gonna go say hi to others running pape tonight
And all your attacks having big arrows showing you charge them and you have a dodge button
gotta support this community
Coney is very sad
They at least have good goal celebration animations
yeah, new strikers doesn't interest me
and that's before the lack of Daisy
2 yeah
couldve been worse COPIUM
I hate Rune Factory 5
He can't milf hunt
WHY DOES THIS GAME PRESENT ME WITH LADIES THAT ARE 100% MY TYPE, THEN TELL ME I CAN'T BLOODY HAVE THEM
He wants to wreck homes
THIS SUCKS
I'd rather hear playground
jenysrMips Jeny raid jenysrMips
jenysrMips GL
oh no he says KEKW
jenysrMips Gl phantom!!
I have to do some things so I will be back in a few!!
did you hand in the mailbag? thats my guess LUL
ask merluvlee FeelsOkayMan
is this a chat assisted speedrun jcogLUL
just don't call it a TAS bc then you're calling us all tools NiceSoftlock
ive been called worse
oh no
glitchless 100.99% category when?
Improvement is improvement. We take what we can get
Is this route new?
Oh cool!
How does safe ending differ from the risky one? I have yet to look at the routes
Hmm I see
Hai hai. :D
Don't sound so enthused to see me, gosh.
I'm diving into glitchless today actually. Making some notes for myself on the route then practicing some specific chapters. Should be a couple days until I run it
Nope but I am all ears
Yeah I'm doing safe route
Power bouncing huff. Yeah I think chapter 6 in general is gonna be one of those I need to practice. Same with 7
You say that but yo those mirrors and knowing where to go mess me up lol
Honestly everything is on the practice list lmao
Oh yeah chapter 4 might be tough too for me. Lol it�s just a lot but I'm excited to learn
Oh absolutely
Uh yes. I want to
Not sure if I can't
Oh cool! I be sure to look for that when I get there
madman really out here doing mega bomb
Rigby235: m
pb with mega bomb PAUSERS
mx_four: Rigby235:
yo Ryan
hellowo fowevew
and ghl
that was a typo, but let's say it stands for good heckin' luck
I'll miss my #freecannonless movement but I'm super happy with this rando update
Good heckin luck
same. that was my big issue too
What is this chapter eight that you speak of?
trick question. speedrunners don't know what chapter 8 is
also hi Ryan
Have you ever done any Thousand Year Door stuff?
What about any%? Ever thought about learning glitches for said game?
Arent the tricks like crazy hard in TTYD
I wanna see a phantom palace skip
yeah exactly. 60 fps frame perfect monkaS
What about the abomination that is Origami King? LuL
Mario out here using the Kirby hammer for a moment.
it took me an embarrassingly long time what you meant by laki fight. was trying to figure out which fight we use laki for
forgot we actually fight the dude
in a rando streamer now and we don't fight laki idk
You don't want to have to run some Refund backup strats? :D
quit dreamin pal
this is why i don't run anymore
i got too many tastes of the doogan dong and i didn't like it
doogan dong
hm odd
So, please explain the "MegaBomb%" bit to me.
The madlad.
That's... certainly a strategy.
Sounds time consuming, yeah.
Mistakes? Mn... Steaks. I miss steaks.
rowf is an air raid fan
my pb is 6 you can do it
go phantom go!
6th try
he's doing it!!!
New WR incoming.
so close
Mission failed successfully.
7???? holy crap
Sometimes, video games just say no.
now I have nothing Sadge
my pb is also 6th i think
m4 is 6 as well iirc
6 6 6 monkaS
do it with your highlight attached lmfao
yeah i agree
I love that attitude.
if i get worse than first try i want it to be really bad
in the last 56 runs i've only gotten worse than 2nd try once and it was 3rd
i think total 1st try is still just over 75% for me
which i'll take lmao
oh yeah i guess overall i have no clue what my rng is
i could maybe find out if i looked at my split files but idc about my old ones as much
yo glgl
yeah like before i started my grind i could still pb with either a fail or second try or both bc that happened once at 3:44 lmfao
not that i cant now but like eh
Doing a run i see :D
something happend i'm guessing?
0.000244140625 is 0.25^6
then * .75 would be 7th try right
well if you fail agian do rando :3
like in rando you can't fail :)
why do we need all the peach segments
and get that gomba away
imagine playing glitchless at all tbh
he got you there hehe
new category extension?
just woke up from a late nap
maybe can stream later
its storming pretty hard here
Hikari doesnt like storms axlsenCoward
sometimes shell come in here and shake at my feet
best song
The castle theme is so nice
Oh no. I stepped away for a few minutes, and we've reset again. D:
What happened this time?
Ah, okay.
you excited about it?
finally someone with an honest opinion
looks like every other arena fighter and throw in every direction
hey look we are back where i joined hehe
we went back in time
oh shit, komaris is starting soon
same they have to use buster up
ive seen someone do it
maybe method?
thats how long its been LUL
bn2 buster only is the dumbest thing ever
remember axlsenWut before shadowman?
you can hit him with buster but frame perfect, so its 12 frame perfect charge shots before style change
then you need heat style for null and void in undernet
bn3 you need heat style for bass aura
in bn33 id run kawarimi on navicust
bn3, you know
hides behind a rock
phantom, did you know im a mitzi bro for life
mitzi bro
I need a bro emote now LUL
Just for axl
there are so many "If this happens do this" in the route
oof, sounds like komari is peaking
Yeah just trying to make the notes not hurt my brain as much
speednotes live
speed GUIDES live ok
ill look into ti
wait phantom, dont they have to do falzar?
how would you clear matches classes?
you cant reach the back
or I mean you cant do fire dmg
I didnt know such a thing as speedguides existed phanto274Hype ty ty I shall use it
i wonder if gregar is even possible
getting heat cross sounds like the killer
this morning I got home at 6:30... damn i missed the end of mitzi's run KEKW
imagine getting reflectr from robodog comp LUL
its easier since it only has mettaur encounters
but very slow
yoo congrats
congrats!! welcome to the cool kids club
Yaaaas ty ty <3
I can officially move on to glitchless for a while
cursed cartridge
send axl old cart?
like the name :D
perfect LUL
phantom is too good for us!!!!
is this update live?
letters sounds gross
i mean yea idek those rewards never did that shit lol
yeah id take default out of the rotation
so each FP move cost -2?
mario went boom
nice glitch bruh
fun where i live it's raning :D
ToyBox Hype!
fire kammy LUL
crystal ball?
what does that give you in vanilla?
hehe rigby is playing paper mario to :D
go fast
i'm here all the way Phantom
icebox buster only axlsenS
i'm happy i found you here on twitch :D
this this the glundo? Kappa
waiting on the run back
hehe blue watt
1FP but flower saver so how does that work?
so i tried killing fuzzypede without watt by ending with volt shroom. but in the dark fuzzy just heals himself F
i just did it to see if the next cutscene would have a different partner text box
she is sick
curious to try auto kill and practice rom to see what happens
freight jar axlsenCoward
chapter 5 music is the best :D
yo? my game shop got Intellivision II system and loads of CIB games
i have no way to connect it tho
thats 2nd gen right?
FOR GAME PRESERVATION!!
boxed copy of he-man omg
diveman oof
sub 1:45
nah, just the kids
all this talk about buster only
but what about hamme ronly Kappa
i wish that dried shroom was a trap OMEGALUL
whats the badge?
i never noticed marios face on it lol
nice check there buddy
i be gone maybe 15 min gl
did they really take an ad break during the middle of the run?
they stopped komaris run to run run some ads
umm ... no
cream party?
i say chapter 2
you waiting on weight for chapter 3?
btw I order my ps5 panels
the went for preorder this week
have the purple controller so want it to match
buy weed everyday phanto274Jam
i tired the expansion pak again today and no luck
tried 2 differrent jumper paks and it booted fine
mark said he has an extra and will hook me up
why is the weight lower on the list?
then why is goombario at the very top Kappa
i had no idea what that was, "is that a tumor???"
how is the run going?
why cant you sell?
makes sense, he needs to store those items somewhere OMEGALULA
missed the caplock at the end there LUL
that looks so much easier
mitzi take notes
as long
someone scalping star pieces
oh no he is dead
i love you dont have laki yet
it's very sad that we don't have laki :c
lakileister? more like lack luster Kappa
laki where are you :c
5 years later
grabbed a drink, what was in the chest?
a bomb
wish it was a laki trap just to spite you KEKW
Maybe with that attitude it's too much
hey dawg those text boxes aren't randomized, I was promised everything being random
twitch just gave me an ad on the main page for condoms
dont they know that this page is for gamers?
Runs didn't go well, I take it?
wow, ghost goomba.
is it the one that has a call of duty-type loadout screen?
shocked that star piece stayed the same
know your demographic twitch!
I'm okay with more randos.
you can explore chapter 6 right
ive never properly played oot on n64 so will be starting that off stream soon
need to find a good button layout
how do wii do it?
just add a mic attachment and hum the songs
that sounds clean
oh boy playing songs that were meant to use a d pad on a joystick aint fun try playing pac man with a regular non arcade joystick
sub 2 at elementman
the colored plants are cannibals... huh.
I've been playing the original Zelda with my daughter on Switch with a pro controller and it's so difficult because of the D-pad. I tried the stick but noped out of that real quick
thats the run GG
are those phantom coins?
if we get goombario in the place of mega rush that will be so disappointing
ooh chapter 3 opening up
is therre a story behind the name phantom?
wanna know pain? try playing sm64 without a z button and doing bomb clip as the FIRST STAR OF THE CHALLENGE
laki can go over lava but not water axlsenWut
when did you get weight?
That letter was a bomb. That's messed up.
I just looked down and thought "whats the green ultra stone" LUL
dont remember if I asked you or if it was someone else.,.,.
is yoshi cookie made from yoshi?
HE KNOWS THE LORE
you should know koopa fortress would have traps
nice they dont have the "partner joiined your party"
its the real one this time KEKW
i missed it but komari did indeed show off the parasol cutscene
in sky town
spider is still the best
oh wait i forgot
MEGAMAN ATTACK!!!
yeah, bn3 has the best one lol
rip harry's shop
oh! thats how you do colonel quick kill
it prevents him from summoning the soldier
you have to hit him before he moves again but he has i frames so its tight
so hit him twice on the same panel
did you upgrade hammer?
this is chap 7 tutenkoopa aint it
it DID in fact do damage even if its 1
clean fight
Cheer100 Cheer100 GET FUCKED NERD
get rainbows nerd OMEGALUL
i need to give 600, not in any rush
is there any reason to pick power bomb over mega bomb?
does mega do more dmg?
yo!! gavel skip
going into judgemanEX with 1 HP axlsenS
the book got im LUL
yeah, i have no idea how the book works
gavel got him KEKW
book in his front row
he's choking on gavel now
3 times in a row failed
its bad unless you are risch
they have those same hit boxes in mother comp too
when you do the passwords
oh no
he's doing judge with beastout
thats so cringe
oh damn i missed his beast fight
I see a really big problem here.
You have Goombario.
thats a blessing
That's not a Watt, this is a Watt.
And all this to go save the Princess? I dunno... Effort vs Reward...
I'm not huge on this Bow color.
your going strong i see
green tubba :D he is also sick
question about your audio
your mic doesnt pick up your game audio since you dont have headphones?
im sure I dont need mine but I love my headphones
have audio technia m40x
now for mario to smell the bed
oh letter insanity is new?
wait why do you have goombario with you?
???? What's that teal Ultra Stone???
oh, yeah
I forgot
I mean, it IS the same sprite as the Ultra Stone tho
so I'm not TECHNICALLY wrong
that was easy
weird, but not unwelcome
kinda miss the lightning, ngl
EXCUSE ME
THAT'S OD
why would you ever not just nuke everything
what do you missing?
oh no
does the chest do anything in rando?
YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER *misses*
Master does better when he stops talking shit
this seed's pain
50 years later
this is kinda like 100% run hehe
this seed is evil
we in go mode?
its been 5 hours my guy!
your on the final goal now :D
sub 6 lets go!!
but 1FP bomb is worth it
have a wild clip to share
yo glhf
i got to final but my lategame was shit
lost a min to final anyway lmao
holy shit lmao
holy shit
does the new setting let Mario do the smart thing and fly straight to Bowser
wasn't wrong then
I WAS KIDDING
once we get the konami collection
what do you mean?
thats all konami does now
a konami collection that isn't bugged to Hell n' back
I just made myself worried about that TMNT collection
the cowabunga collection
cuz I'll grab that if it's a functional experience
im not worried, its by digital eclipse the same guys the did megaman legacy collec ... nevermind
but phantom it has power fighters ... POWER FIGHTERS!!!
is it possible to just power thru and win on phase 1?
i hate stuff like that, bn3 has the bass fight you cant win
btw, how is routing going?
my seed hurt me. did yours hurt you?
nope not at all
how much of Koopa koot did you do?
chased a moth out of my room lol
is this what they call "god tier rng"?
HI YOUTUBE
why do you do this to yourself
you skip checks,
then it bites you
mine ane m4s seed had....
anti guy had ice palace key. seed behind 4th ruins key, which we got from a letter which was found in palace. Goomba king had tubba key. master 1 had star stone. Koopa koote 18th request had tubba key. so lantern ghost had luigis autograph
Do it again in under 4 hours and 40 minutes
What do you mean unlucky
You have goombario
when is quizsanity
Make it a 100k point reward
Nobody WANTS to play it
It's just really funny
Like sploosh kaboom + auction rando for WW
If m4 isn't you can raid sway
Sway just started
on alt
I like that your tracker shows spirit order now
Old ass
"This was a seed" Drake
Is it me or did you shave?
hello friendo
rando bullied me axlsenWut
time for me to make another Megamind meme
couldnt figure out how to clear a single chapter
not having bomb, para, or bow walled me out of chapter 2 3 and 4
may god rest your soul, you are going to play park dear god
selling ultra jelly was hype
I made meme and put in #memes
If you get speedy you get the other half of weed mario
You have to earn it
too bad he gets it anyways
Streaming multiversus would just be free stream content but like
I just don't want to play it lol
just play Jake Jake
*Jake, Jake
multiversus is not fun to watch lol
Like I got top 100 and top 5 with my char I really don't care lol
My classic play of getting high enough rank to say a game sucks
Jake called Finn Jake and he said that's his name now, so I told him that'll be his name as well
yo glgl
beating glenn on the leaderboard should be easy lol
I really hope it gets better cause the ideas are there
It's just not fun yet for me
Yea I was top 60 before I stopped
Singles I refused to touch lol
No good players are being voted in to the gimvitational so far lol
Crowned should be supported not this bullshit lol
We need to get crowned to actually break even they lost fucking 10k from sponsors because gimr had to flex his microdick
Also who wants to fucking campaign 50k to go to a hazards tourney at a horse track
The only other thing is coneys house but you can't go there unless you spend 99million channel points
Yea combo breaker is gonna have a billion things at the venue and I also know that area and there's a lotta good food and shit
Didn't port get shit on by a SWT event last year
Sounds about right
Now that they're done gimr said hold my beer
And gives 0 shits now
And people wonder why Ceo, ricks events, and anything bts wouldn't opt in to swt
Gimrs current event structure just shits out events with no prize pool just to get viewership
And every event i hear the same exact issues with everything in the venue lol
Well bighouse fucked theirs anyway
shit I didn't get to vote
I mean did gamble
I'm tired
splatoon is a joke too! grand prize is a jacket, a switch case, no prize money? get the fuck out!
oh they get 10K platinum points cant forget that one!
That might be why the panda circuit is taking a while they might be fixing that fingers crossed
Where gimr has enough setups to run bracket and then takes everything down the split second top whatever starts
Yea top players live off content anyway, tourney money is just extra
Yea I literally am only going to double down because jesse
Their modded setups are ASS
Mods should stay out of bracket
Like if anyone ever wanted me to turn off my shit when I bring my switch for whatever I would just do it cause idc if I only have colors and a few songs it just makes sense
I mostly bring mine for training mod and friendlies
whats your take on slippy for events?
oh wow
Yea it was just a couple dudes making it in free time I don't imagine it'd be groundbreaking lol
Like they did a good job but it's not absurd
thats so funny
luigi skip frame by frame
whats the most recent release? I have fp-1.1.0
yeah he gave it to me, should still have the link
when I arrived to the fortress blue koopa bro came out "YO ITS LEONARDO!!!"
They should make npc model rando
time to scramble an egg into an omelette
just ordered pape jpn... and thats everything. Can finally stop spending money on this game LUL
people do that?
m4 is testing new controllers hopefully they stop getting fucked for random tricks they can't do
hammer cancel is s w a g though
im mean i dont plan on grinding or anything
thats very fair
i mean with having eng and jpn on ED thatll give me 4 copies for saves lol
Top 4 of the local today was steve, cloud, steve, steve
get me out
Jaemi lost to only steve at advantage state and got 3rd
2 locals in a row had 3 steves in top 4
Actually what was the fuckin top 8 for fridays local I forgot about that one
Ok failbot didn't go yesterday so it was only TWO steves in top 4
The steve that's not mirai or failbot though sucks idk how he's getting top 4's
I've played him once and he just did layer 1 shit and I fucked him up lol
And he tried his pocket hero and proceeded to burn all his mana while I walked away
Heros other specials are really good
stage 2 side b is absurd
But yea minnesota has gone from the megaman state to the steve state
these fucks hate fun
I gotta send you a clip tho of something jaemi did to a steve on wednesday
Cause the ones that aren't failbot are genuinely mashers
Yeti got banned from AS because of a misunderstanding and they never reverted it after he privately cleared things up with the actual person involved
I think he's back in like a month or 2
he apologized and got banned still
He was friends with that person prior and after though they commentated together at the last 2 AS's he was at before being banned and I'm pretty sure that was after the thing happened lol
At least if it was who I think it was
Oh yea between the megaman era and the steve one there was also all the megamen playing minmin for a bit before she got nerfed
The minmins never won anything though because loaf existed
The one dlc pass2 matchup that's just really good for wario lol
get the maple in tubba's castle
Visitor just salt tweeted about steve and all the mn people are in the replies knowing it's a salt tweet/joke tweet and everyone from the other parts of twitter are MAD
Yay smash Twitter
Like visitor was megaman and minmin MN knows he's not allowed to tweet about characters
I follow the top players whose content I like and people in region
The rest of my twitter is art or fgc
speaking of fgc
Fgc is so much nicer to follow than smash it's crazy, like there's still shitheads but the overall group is so much better to look at
ya love to see it
buff00n I'm in a smash mood go set up your shit
There's a char I wanna fuck around with that jibca has inspired me to retry
I do not fathom the people play Miis in the Nintendo-3rd-party smorgasbord fighting platformer game
The rollback felt wack in doubles but in 1v1 it felt good
Did you plug a wire into your ps5 or were you still running wifi
I figured LOL
Like if you didn't plug it in for strive I doubted you would for multi
I've been playing unwired because I've been too lazy to make the hole mine is going through larger for 2 wires and it's felt more or less the same lol
When we got this current router tho I just stopped having packet loss issues at all on wifi on my pc
Ps4 tho I still had to wire because that shit sucks and mainly why I got pc strive LOL
Yea if the speeds are pretty much the same and you're not getting packet loss you really don't need to lol
A quarter of gigabit is still like 10x better than what most people are running LOL
Guess who is back to watch my favorite stremer :D
Fanart has sold me on Ingrids design for 3hopes
Although everyone draws the hair way nicer than it actually is lol
I've not played that game type since i played warriors 1 like a year and a half ago so I'm just in the mood for it
speedrun hyrule warriors when
witch one there is two
FE warriors was so close to being really good
the story is okay gameplay meh
If they just didn't 3ds post exclusively and didn't have clones I would like it so much more
I was mad that the fates chars were the ones with unique shit because I didn't want to play them
Falco doesn't deserve fun
you got the maple, right?
@TacoGuyy was eating
I'm ready
oh you never responded to it so I didn't setup lol
I haven't gotten my setup out since as gimme a sec lol
@buff00n lobby up
just be like morph he don't think
same that's why I can't sleep ever lol
do a glitch TF2John
that's not
the emote I wanted
why did it complete to that
what the fuck even is that emote
TF2John who is tf2 john
why is he
He is not safe hggMickey
wow buff00n was the first one ready but heavy day has already looped once
and he aint here
Least this song slaps
Ok back to goldlewis theme
modCheck still an empty lobby
how many guilty gear songs will I burn through before he shows up
None of these songs are short either lol
lobby is more dead than buff00ns punctuality
BITCH MAKE ME WRONG FOR ONCE PLEASE
was talking to my mum
get the game right dumbass
also lobby is back up
PROLOGGERS YO WHEN WAS THIS ADDED
oh yeah go fast
almost forgot
dont go fast
spite him
the moment I threw out that dtilt I said "ah, right. Super armor"
y'know I forgot about wing armor too
I just wanted to poke the floor
im imagining kolorado puking on the SSTuna
have you played harvest moon 64?
same here i loved it
i got it cheap at a movie rental
remember buying used games at movie rentals?
i forgot sushie is purple
new strats?
I was lurking in a stream with pape 64 HD textures, really dont like how it looks honestly. Feels like the personality of the partners are gone
wait on cardboard mario
paper mario X Labo
im not
nintnedo doesnt do things that make "too much sense"
a new glitch!?!?
its something that happens in this speedrun
ive seen that in speedruns
just not glitchless KEKW
i approve of using bombette more
you didnt even use bombette tho
oh? I didnt notice
mustve been out of it
I forgot it was yoshis I can't do that and live
"he's falling kinda fast- oh"
yea I inputted fastfall after the fair instead of before so it maintained the speed lol
but rando is fun :D
that i can see hehe
run rando and a different speed game LUL
do ttyd rando
if it existed then maybe
smrpg rando
WW rando is genuinely pretty fun every now and then
and it's like the most beginner friendly tricks
so is there only paper mario that has rando in the era?
i see
uh oh
i turned on turbo and dont know how to turn it off LMAO
fair enough
turbo socpens2FAST
ive never actually played it
despite having a snes mini
I do NOT understand the hype behind Geno
I had a snes growing up but it just had smw, all stars, and aladdin
even yoshis island?
aladdin fucking SLAPPED tho
CANnot fathom why people love Geno
jesse has bad taste
tbf, I like SMRPG for it's music, graphics humor
and nonsense
Me and my sibling found star world before we had access to the internet and our minds were fucking blown
SMB3 > SMW
stop spittin'
I grew up with both and I never liked 3
you're flooding my house
with facts
stop being unlucky
I had a sega, brother had a snes. But he lived with his grandmother [we had different dads] we hung out ever other weekend. Sometimes he would surprise me and bring his snes over. Then eventually he gave it to me. I still have it.
I dont wanna hear it
I had an atari 2600 until I got my sega OMEGALUL
irememberr the controller more than the games KEKW
Oh yea the other game my snes had was american ff3
Brother had a Genesis, Uncles had a Genesis and SNES
and that's the only ff game I ever played
so I had the best of both worlds
do you like them or hate them?
one thing I love about black pit is shortcuts when fightings, like C up is jump, c right is hammer ect.
I'm slowly learning that sephiroth can kinda do the things I want
He does what I wanted ike to do but then he can actually fucking move
i love seeing duck hunt
Raito is playing banjo now so we have 0 duck hunts
I missed seeing void wrecking shit with pichu
out of the gate that shit was hype
lightning loops LUL
I like watching dabuz if he's playing rosa
Puppet chars are always cool to me
it'd be really funny
i broke the practice rom lol
was on goomba road loaded a warp and i picked up the star rod then it crashed
i only tried to go to toad town
y'know I didn't like the situation I got put in for being right
I was correct on him swinging then my octoslash traded and got me kill combod offstage because he had less hitstun
shield breaker, baybeeeeeeee
feeling pretty tired so calling it here
uhhhhhhh can you skip this on JP?
Marth would've killed that
If you were marth I don't think I'd ever lose my wing before I cap out the damage
only one way to find out
that should've been tipper when you got that 2nd wing
there I could play the game since we weren't on lylat
This char not it on slants lol
go approximately 45.5 seconds faster
he bolted
not even tipper fsmash feels satisfying
this character SUCKS
I just broke buff00ns ankles
Shimmied the fuck out of a grab
gl with the run PogChamp
I only know the Green Meadows part of the run so seeing the other levels will be cool
PAPER POKEMON 64, WOWIE!!!! MY FAVORITE GAME!!!!
I'm shiny hunting Eevee in Arceus and I got a shiny Carnivine
Haunted and Granite zone are my personal favs
Gotta love motion controls
Better than the dog island sled racing tho
gtg but gl with the rest of the run!
nice obstacles
all friends Pog
wait idk you ran this!
yeah but steam deck and crippling warioware addiction so I didn't check twitch lol
I actually got my first 100 in a warioware set
was pretty pog
Hi Phantom and Chat! Saw your Dog Island run recently and had a lot of fun. :)
Yup, the GDQ one
I love Paper Mario. I don't know what Battle Network 6 looks like, I think I saw the beginning of 3 and I was mindblown by the manips ...
6 has no manips
I have no idea what those mean xD Guess I gotta wait till I catch you streaming it :P
Why'd you hit him
what you didn't have was mercy
Don't know about that either o: Sorry I still have a lot to learn haha
and she wanted to throw hands
I went positive on jaemi with my seph in friendlies today tho
I hit my footstool shit it's pretty simple on falco hitboxes because of the hitstop
But yea it's very satisfying to have falco dair my shield and I stop on him and impale him
is this pokemon the best one for this?
The minigame glenn has played for like 50 hours
clearly ... they used their own secret wood stash
item sliding oneeMonkas
Fridge when are we making a Bridge emote
oh shit there's a fridge on a bridge emote
you should make me a 7tv editor
I need to add gerberwott
0.49 seconds O_o
He's tied at worst on all of them I think
Me saying he played 50 hours was not exaggerated
He had way too much patience for it
He would just do 8 hour streams of that shit
That's some dedication xD
Speaking of dedication, imma go nap for a bit, how much longer do you stream for?
I'd play this map in hots
hey phantom I called mid rigby2NinOko
Lowkey this is the layout of cursed mines LOL
BloodTrail awesome, good luck with the rest of the run, though you'll gold every split it seems
The only thing mid is you tacogu1Cool
Ok I have to leave for the strive local in like 5 minutes so I should get ready
have fun making friends and murdering baby pokemon
I already know glalie fucks I'll survive
16 minute gold?
skill issue
this minigame was my GOAT when i played this game LUL
blaziken is def the worst
how do they keep track
for all we know we couldve been the 1026th visitor
ight well anyways imma lurk now, gl on the power of friendship
yay it's still going lol
that music reminded me a bit of mario, ngl
in casual, what else are berries for? you have way too many
Okay. I'ma need you to explain yourself on this one.
Nothing to say for youself? KEKWait
Did you ever play Hey You, Pikachu! on the N64?
I never had any issues with it.
I might go play some DBD for a bit, but, this is certainly something.
Good.. uh... luck?
Good.. good job.
I think.
ooh rando
the way Watt was positioned for a sec, I thought you had to buy her from Ralph
I love the Waluigi color, but I don't care even the slightest about Waluigi himself
it's backwards, I admit that
I instinctively almost asked "why"
these Boos know what's up
the turtle gives you the "Slow Go" badge
How was park driving from work
what is a short rando? starting with 3 cards?
I've never seen the train smash the rock
you know you don't wanna save the yoshis
don't let the challenge runners hear that
Laki can do lava but not water?
Laki isn't waterproof
I like the red penguins
but you can't use his ability right?
Can't believe that penguin fuckin died
no it's not
what is that copypasta
@Glennjaamin No I have not, thank you for asking
Np TacoGuy
why's the temple still in the sand
HOLY MOLY
then how'd you get the star spirit
yee I doing rando
I'm 3 hours in and I STILL haven't found Parakarry
I even have everything to beat Ch 3
it's just like "where the hell are you hiding"
I also think more coconuts were added
I have found waaay more than I usually do
this seed SUCKS
excuse me
thats a sin
that was a little worth it
fried goomba on the menu tonight
do you have blue key?
oh wait you have red key
what a tease
thank you Koover
Parakarry had a crash landing
no bubble tree?
He crashed his Xbox
hey hey hey
thats true
it wasn't my fault kinda
Speaking of crashes?
Coley's cursed
uh oh
THAT'S A YIKES FROM ME, DOG
I CURSED THE STREAM NotLikeThis
oh god you had lettersanity turned on??
please title the yt video as "Short Rando(?)"
oh Redd is chill
cya dude gn LUL
have you ever been in a situation where your diglet couldn’t evolve when it was on like donkey Kong.. it’s like you needed a Mario to make it bigger but instead you get a from Mario Kart.. but it was like sonic the hedgehog but over before it started with no continues.. so you lay down like snorlax really embarrassed.. it’s like you need a majoras mask to cover yourself in front of princess Peach.. not the castle you wanted to show her
the decor on the castle made me think Piplup was the one talking about being cold to friendship
ah, I never got a chance to play this as a kid it's so cute! Also hey hey, GL on learning the route!
LUL -SpAtk? ouch
Golem is very friend shaped
how is iron so rare? in almost every other game ever it's gold that's hard to get

I didn't study for no pop quiz

aw heck yeah spooky time
I mean I'd not wanna meet a Tangrowth down a dark alley bro LUL
scary parties you say?
waggle warrior time
Cranidos OP LUL
I was not emotionally prepared for such a spooky Pokémon
to whom do I send my therapy bill
He more or less caused this run to happen in some shape or form
It's a very long pipeline but it does connect to him
I mean I would've
He goes to advantage states
I should run park 2 again I need a run on SRC that's not our co-op run I didn't contribute in LOL
Let's just race park 1
Park 1 doesn't ha e oshawott
So I will play 2
Park 1 has Jolteon in pre-game tho
Park 2 is post so ew
Also shake requirements
Only thing better about Park 2 is the dance zone mini game

my eevee pb doesn't have rhyhorn
my first 3:0x was so good except for that lol
i wonder how much time it loses to miss that
i feel like it's gotta be at least like 30 but overall it isn't bad
it's also worse the longer you don't have pony

Chikorita hesitated before following you in, she did it on purpose
go fast already
you go fast
dont wanna
maybe tm
you saved me, i was so bored i was tempted to play danganropa
so thx btw
Bulbasaur's a bro
i usually get treeko and my swing dependents are either aipom/ambipom or buizel/floatzel
hide and seek peasant smh
aipom would be across bridge by mankey
I've been checking throughout the day both yesterday and today to congratulate you for your run. but never lived when i checked whomLUL
and aipom spawns ambipom
aipom chase
ambi battle
your run made the English any% runs to 50
i also amused watching it to verify it
hi cinder
hi glenn
boop firework already
im scared
dont be
last any% i spent 50 seconds looking for torchic
just be a minute faster
i dont wanna relive that
i can easily bop firework all i need is to not do password pikachu for gyarados
why are you even using passwords anyways Glenn
use to do it so brain went "do it again"
i *should* come back into speedrunning
I'll just verify things
and say hi glenn when he puts it in the description
no quick kill?
decent mankey
better than my most recent mankey kills tbh
anyways hi. I'm Cinder. the main mod for Park 1 cinder23Smile
so i heard in your vod. all friends
i approve
ooo we can race :)
i.e do it at the same time
as long as your all friends any% time beats Cheez's normal any% time. you're golden
for my sanity sake
aw man I'd love to watch a race
cheez's normal any% time is like 4hr
if it seems I'm mean to Cheez, don't worry. he's my friend and LITERALLY WANTS TO BE THE WORSE PARK RUNNER
YOOO ODDISH FREE
BACK BY BRIDGe
imagine doing h&s strats whomDerp
there's basically two spots and you could see one of them during the countdown
imagine having a good time in this game gcjLUL
that headbutt of frustration pieBaited
peepoSad missing spearow jump
Pachirisu noooooo
i feel like the game would be rude to me for not playing it in so long
i'd recommend still going for golduck for the sake of gyarados attraction
pokepark was kind to me after i took a break
for all friends it was like 3 minutes or somethin
park was kind to me in a race with furi and rob when livesplit crashed and mid run i was editing whoms pokemon counter thing for Series race
and that was the last time
i might do park bingo soon cause bingo funny
also i spent like 2 hours making bingo layouts
I'm off to bed. i expect a run to verify with all of Mantis' tomorrow's gcjHi
goals are okay tbh cause they are split between attraction/friend making decently well
i shall
bye bye cinder
tell Josh to submit his park ils he did like last week

Chikorita just wanted to talk

yeah mamoswine can walk on that he wont fall through its good
froslass laughing at glalie's pain D:
rude af
Froslass is gonna leave him for you PokPikachu
first mawile now this
torterra is one of the easiest fights but yall aint ready for that conversation
oH yeAH TorTERra iS eASy, juSt PusH hIM iNTO thA WaTER
not having that convo
Mamoswine wtf man WutFace "it's okay that he attempted to murder me, or at the very least imprison me in ice forever, we just have different viewpoints"
who do you think you are, bradyboo, world record holder of park 1
i still love that vid when legends was announced, where they edited the trainer over the torterra fight
okay glennjamin, 14th place holder of mario 3d world
not even my greatest achievment, you mean, glennjaamin, world record holder of every pokepark gyarado IL
who do you think you are, uhhhh idk woo #
Are you doing max dash or double dash route?
11 obv
what comes out of bonslys eyes
rainbows, of course
meowth is the poor man's backup to torchic
we dont talk about torchic
this is a funny game to listen to
you just hear random pokémon names
i love the cries in this game
tbolt her for consistency shift3
froslass just bullied glalie we caught it in 4k
now hes gotta do the crate strat to save 0.002 seconds :0
the glenn strat
actually if you pick up a crate and shove yourself into the corner you can clip into the next zone
cant wait for the summoning salt video where he talks about the glenn strat
the game was dry with runs forever until one day a discovery was found dubbed "the glenn"
if i had a nickel for every person ive convinced to play park, i would have 2 nickels
which isnt much but still surprising
brady look at what you've made him do
fricken item sliding
mf did it on the wrong side
its the only place that actually might save time
hardest thing in the game and all you do is just run against a wall ResidentSleeper
this man making the loop
i love the raichu cry. who did that with their mouth
losing half a second not picking gible smh
it's only like that cause you dont care about the bonus
if you want third stage dash get bonus with gible cause its 5k
theres like 4 options for this attraction, gible saves the most time and raichu is the easiest and most lenient
DUGTRIO NOOO
NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
just get magby
dugtrio is in the route wtf
LMAO BRADY
how have you been completing runs
Dugtrio is free as hell he's just a talk
when is eevee version?
it is i just checked lol
you know... the better version
getting gaslighted in my route
this game looks cringe
if you are following the route but skipping dugtrio im confused on how you can get past rotom without being roadblocked
he got an extra in meadow since he went ambi/aipom as well
Ohhhh ok
he should be way over atm tbh
what can Pikachu do with a gold nugget
enter the drug trade
i remember when we didnt know you can just hold the run button to run through that cutscene
we used to have to mash and it was like a 2 frame window for a 1 sec time save lol
rhyperiors is a nightmare in allfriends :(
are you a sick enough dude to be friends with rhyperior
stinky attraction
you can skip the bonus in this actually
my favorite part
oh boy
lurking playing some minecraft with pokepark sfx is not expected to be relaxing
theres no timing its honestly just buffering your inputs and mashing
agreed. still not consistent at it
drifblim is saying glenn i swear
ah yes autoscrollers my favorite
all the same lmao yeah
lmao when you put it like that
Pokepark speed runs? Interesting
I didn't know it had a battle system like this
Cheer10 gg
thousands upon thousands to save 5 seconds at the end of the day
now do it again
Same lol
Jibca gets here in like 6 hours
Ooh where you going?
Combo breaker
Do a rando on the plane
Nice, have fun!
Loaf tweeted about mn smash being negatively different since 2019 and I'm glad finally someone brought it up lol
I've been talking to jibca about that for months
YO RIDDLES JOINING TEAM LIQUID
It's weird to explain but like the energy is just different, the top end is just shitters and then there's a gap for the twins and failbot and some of the TO's running shit now are just eugh
Mainly just the TO for saturday shit who is currently being ratiod absurdly hard in loafs replies LOL
But yea I'm not engaging with the twitter end of that because there's no reason to
So I just posted a mario odyssey weed mario
MORE SPLITS
DOUBLE LIVE
But yea Idk why people are that surprised about loafs tweet, it's the reason Jibca won't play ultimate for the most part
Like he has gripes with the game itself but he's said to me he mainly won't go to shit because he just doesn't care for the people anymore
He'll come with for me and jaemi tho on some occasions
Yea when I went to AS I was like "Oh I should talk to people and whatever" then I got there and realized besides lucky who do I really wanna talk to there besides hanging out with like jaemi and failbot lol
Cause plant isn't there
If brady goes I'll hangout with him tho
I didn't get to meet him that was the one week he didn't go lol
GL PHANTOM I WILL MIGRATE TO BED TO WATCH
Brady I'm likely gonna be at like every AS in june so go to those
i wasnt at todays either lol
I wanted to go today but work + ride isn't in town currently
did they halve his coin requirement
I haven't played since rando patch 1 lol
i have no idea what you look like taco so you have to be the one to find me
look at any of aurawolfs sets from last AS besides the lucky one and I'm right behind him
Also this seed is very good
It has goombario
Bow is pretty good at hide and seek
She had a good spot
Goombario is the best tho that's why you never get him usually
The only reason :)
Surely you would never find him and leave
He's just a good hider
But yea I've felt a similar thing to the st cloud people for like months too lol
Like I pretty much just go to hangout with the TO, Shrumble, and Jaemi
Old ass
everyone is so weird at locals
what do i expect though its a local LOL
MN locals are very interesting crowds
But yea at st cloud shit I'll play Wario for Jaemi obv and then I'll play it for the people I know genuinely want to improve and want the exp
But for the shitters I will just go falco
hes going to go falco vs me NotLikeThis
The more I play falco the more I think fuck that character
He has too much shit
Thank god jaemi can't do the IDJ loops LOL
I mash that shit and get 60 for free into kill situation
the 2 things my falco does that jaemi can't
I can dragdown fair off neutral win
And I can IDJ combo
im just an 0-2 but i keep up with everyone in friendlies just fine and win decent amount of them so im fine :)
But then he's just better everywhere else lol
Fuck falco
@Bradybooo I'm playing seph now so I can tell you shit
My seph already going positive in game count in friendlies with aurawolf
Footstool dair is so fucking good for falco murdering
seph wins the matchup tho
They did once
Because lucky isn't my r3 anymore
lemme check again
Seph def wins but like
If I'm not doing good shit I will get falco'd very hard against him
Was very funny at AS last week because Failbot let Jaemi pick yoshis because Failbot mained mario before steve
you have to spam alot of fair in the matchup
And now he perma bans it lol
AS stagelist is some ass tho
Isn't it just everything besides NC
Cause that list is good lol
dont need 3 triplats bro :(
Yea that's a good stage list
It's everything besides HB and NC
and then theres town and kalos and fd
This is just a good stagelist with 3 bans lol
replace kalos and lylat and we chilling
Aight so you're one of those
Starters: Battlefield, Final Destination, Pokemon Stadium 2, Smashville, Town & City Counterpicks: Small Battlefield, Kalos, Lylat Cruise, Yoshi's Story
it does
That's why it's good
it used to have 2 bans like a month ago
It's just the st cloud ruleset besides the fact that it's 3 ban instead of mdsr
2 bans with that stagelist is a nightmare though. 3 is aight
I just need 1 ban for fd
then I'm chillin
FD ain't even bad for me I just don't like it
i played friendlies with jackypoo for my first time at the local for an hour and then i got the dude r1 in bracket
Ezekiel3 YO A THIRD ONE
how shitty is that
They made aurawolf my r3 despite us playing every month in st cloud and also me putting a note on the reg to not do that lol
Like besides failbot I'm the one who would beat jaemi in that venue but I don't wanna do that early lol
Cause MN has no defensive players besides failbot, Jaemi runs his offense to hell and back on people
you say that but half of our region plays steve and samus
and then theres the megamans that carried over from s4
im super sadge about it too theres so many steves and i havent fought one yet. like its a super good matchup for Seph I actually WANT to fight steve
Mirai is a masher so them playing steve doesn't count for that
I've played a buncha friendlies with failbot tho he's a bitch
Cool ass dude but fuck playing him LOL
My bracket hasn't changed since this week lemme name search you
Yep the same
Jaaahsh is in your pool after that lol
Beat his ass
He plays bayo right
thas free
Haus is cool af
get along with him very well at AS and he doesnt play like a bitch its nice
Keep in mind ikan has a powerful mind, he doesn't have a twitter so he is at full mental capacity
they will flood the stage so you can pushed up
you get
What if they put me in jesse's pool and I won
Also AK didn't go to this for some reason
Kinda wanted to beat his ass in bracket
One of my fgc to's is in jesse's pool lol
Proc might have to play DaddyDan r2, they're probably not good but if he loses to Daddy fucking Dan I'm not letting him live it down
im going to bed gn all
The tag is just really good lol
I'm very surprised I'm seeded to leave my pool
I have a top 60 seed somehow
I'm seeded to lose to #2 in chicago and get to top 96 that way
YO TOP NASB CONTENT!?!?!?
You're fucked
He's gonna turn off the voices and start moving
Ok just saw some dude on twitter reply to someone draw genshin protag as black and got offended over it and their pinned tweet was some shit about twitter likes not mattering so I checked there's
And it's anime feet bot posts
what even is the internet
YEA THEIR LAST LIKE
IS FROM "FeetHentaiBot"
jesus fucking christ the likes are all cosplay onlyfans and crinkly foot hentai
That's enough twitter for now I'm going to lab smash for a bit
Do it again
but did you do funny jump
maybe I should look at the screen huh
my b
You get a Drake
If I manage to get top 24 winners I play ned
I'd have to beat steve to do that....
Path before is #2 in IL who plays lucina, I've played before and it went ok
Into lucky which I can very much win
Set with lucky at AS was 2 last hit games that went absurdly close to time lol
I also SD'd game 2
At 20
But it was kalos so after I hit the waft I was big fucking chillin on the plats
Also was demonstrated where his defense lacks because he played jaemi right after
And got shit on LOL
It's so fun watching people play him for the first time
People aren't used to not being allowed to play without having good defensive play
And then Falco hits you twice
Yea me and Jaemi play the exact same with eachother in wifi sessions and there's so many spots where we're mutually like "Yea he hit that offline" so it makes it way easier to mentally play long sessions with him online lol
Ah yes the pinnacle of good option = always good and not looking at why people use the option in a scenario
option = good option*
Why would you ever BW outside of combo without techchase or projectile read
Also wanted to update my mods because I haven't for a bit and had things to add
And realized pc doesn't have an sd slot lol
Yea I wish I wasn't lazy about updating mods and did it sooner
Cause i wanted to add more music before cb lol
I want that new geese theme
Why do my weed mario tweets do better than my clips
I have a weed mario folder now
It has 6 whole unique weed marios
Honestly I'm feeling kinda confident I could place my seed
This bracket isn't too bad honestly
Maister won coinbox after DQ'ing r1 for a covid test lol
what game is this?? hmm well judging from the graphics and the obvious age of the relic I would have to say It would be GARBAGE.. GARBAGE FROM KING GARBAGE FROM THE GARBAGE DYNASTY lol
he won 19 sets in a row on wifi
hahah how are u dude
how long is the flight
u going to combo breaker.. bruuh.. u didn't u say something we could've room and stuff lol
and I would've gone
still would've paid for my share lol
buy the soda
it's refreshing
anyway good luck ok
I'm bringing the ps4 to the airbnb so we can fuck around with kof
I haven't played since launch lol
I just kinda bought it to support the game cause I had extra money and it looked fun but then the matchmaking was ass and no friends had it lol
They still haven't fixed matchmaking but the lobbies are good
Tempted to buy marvel 3 to fuck around too since none of us actually play it it'd be fun
there will be no vergil or morrigan fuckery
I played it a tiny bit with 74 because he bought it for me and it was fun
We just fucked around and didn't lab combos so it was just flailing and it was great
Wdym you don't have a spare dreamcast + crt to fly with lol
I found the original render that was given weed and I can't look at mario the same
could you lzs from that top entry wall onto that table for the item
like if you scew it right
didn't lzs from the clock to that table smh
yea but you lose coolness factor
People are streaming morbius on the artifact category LOL
I DONT KNOW
BUT IT'S MORBIN TIME
I'm putting this up on the other monitor
it's 10 minutes in
aw hell yea they got subtitles too
Jesse is watching it rn too with bear from a separate vod LMAO
The chat is just only saying it's morbin time
holy shit what is this camera work
They just had the slowest fucking shaky cam running scene
and nobody was chasing him LOL
a snack for later
I'm hungry, you don't wanna see me when I'm hungry, he's about to morb I think
he's morbing
CHANNEL GOT BANNED NOOOO
I'm so sad now
I wanted to do a little morbing
i am trying to hook up a wiimote to my computer and having problems
can we watch morbius tomorrow
yeah connecting it is easy it is getting it to do anything that is hard
It wasn't interesting or good from the first 30 minutes but I also want to morb
if you are using dolphin than they have it set up so you can use it easily
but i am trying to use it on stuff that is isn't wii games
Someone is watching revenge of the sith in artifact category lol
so it is hard
That's what it's always been wdym
It's always been hentai and free movies LOL
There is nobody playing this game there's currently streams for Dune, Spongebob, and King of the Hill
was it ever alive
what robotics club were you in in high school?
yeah I am doing that right now
my team is going to egypt over the summer

my shift is looking like 5 or 6 am send halp!
i don't live as far north as Seattle so
I'll be in bed around 8am
I wish that seed in the cave was a trap lmao
so was doesn't annoy me as much as when people think that washington state doesn't exist and just think that Washington dc is the only one
you coming to orlando?
chicago has buff00n so it's worse
one day we'll do the phantom_axl meet up
when I get there it will be better tho
also I have a clip for you
but not now, I'm on mobile
yes, it's worth sharing again LUL
(New game)!
fucking hate new game
Well I'm not a weeb and didn't know that existed sooo
so tell us, what's it like to miss a 25 six times KEKW
typo, I'm blaming auto correct
Maybe it's good I never made you play windwaker you'd still be doing pg skip
so tonight being thurs
if I'm not too tired I'll try rando again
finish and raid me I'm gonna stream while I practice/lab
I'm looking at 45 hours in 4 days axlsenS axlsenRip axlsenCoward
I was gonna a while ago but then there was morbing and I also wanted to watch this seed
no raid Me! I'll be live in 16 hours
He has a good point do that
train station?
my brother offered me a job doing data entry, very considering it
he runs an insulation company
what game are you making
it starts a tadpole
is this a passion project?
don't forget to include a rando mode
why do you think pape rando is so successful?
making video games is hard i am trying to make a board game though
yeah i have like almost everything done for the board game it is just kinda broken in how it plays
is that good?
so it needs to be tweaked
BEST WAIFU
sending that image to komari and dalus
so when bn6 buster only?
did you change your mind yet?
falzar buster only you heard it chat!
time to go back
my bombette mashing is bad
have a safe flight
ok have successfully packed clothes a whole 3 hours before leaving
went to the restroom and randomly remembered I didn't do that lol
I literally only have jeans and most my shirts look the same so it wouldn't have mattered I can do it in 5 minutes LOL
YO THERE'S A NEW MORBIUS ACCOUNT
I CAN WATCH
THE THIRD MORBIUS247
aw hell yea he's already morbing
i don't get how the yoshi's get home after you save them like do they swim through the water or something
this opening sequence is just alien but morbed
couldn't you havealso just mega quaked everyone
Wanna become famous? Buy viewers, followers and primes on yourfollowz. com
no fuck you
it would be a neat touch that if a shyguy is holding slow go the shy guy moved super slow
and if speedy spin it moves super fast
but no one plays without always speedy spin so that would never happen
whens the always slow go setting
just go faster
have you thought about adding a out of logic option to the tracker?
he's morbing again
only 25 minutes of shit that didn't matter but he's doing it again
wouldn't it be better the upgrade fp once than to the thing where your fp+hp go down that way you get even more bp
what is the condition for the crash?
oh i have just never encounterd the crash
my switch won't turn on uh oh
It booted cfw weirdly and loaded home but then it turned off
oh ok we good
Removed SD and waiting a while holding the power button got a vanilla boot
you know why I will never encounter a problem with my switch
because i don't have one
If they release a switch pro I am 100% just going to full homebrew this one and get that
the switch that I want is one that i can get for free
i have a feeling Nintendo isn't ever going to come out with the switch that I want though
Hai hai.
As usual.
How were the badge BP costs in this seed?
wait you can damage hallway through the star sheild
Oh my god.
What the ****.
oh thought it was like final where he has 99 def
is there only two enemies in the game with 99 def
the chat is back to morbing after a brief break to spam "Have sex" for one specific scene
This movie is boring as shit so far LMAO
It's literally only entertaining because of the morbposting
raid morbius_247
Just raid yourself.
And then stream more.
how long till you leave for the flight
Have fun with that, by the way.
you wanna vc after you get ready
Cause I got 2 and a half hours to burn lol
and froslass kinda sus
I feel that ...
uhm ... people usually tell me "give yourself small goals so you can enjoy it all the way" or something of the sort
not like I know how to do that lol
basically so you can feel that "yay I did something!" all the way
yo gl phantom
pb'ing is like a gift tbh, i never expect it
so uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
that new pkmn professor speaks my language
I've not seen anything about the game, but the lady definitely speaks to B
I don't know but I really liked the peach segments in this game the one time I played it... though I got the cake wrong so many times lol
the timing bit always screwed me as a kid
tell me
kid b SUCKED at video games
what a jerk
Good luck!
I'd propose a "RESET" command for channel points, but that sounds godawful on paper
no pun intended
Heyo glgl
That's so fair
Tyty, played not like garbage and made a baller call for checks.
It won't happen again.
Hai hai.
I'm alright. You?
I'd hope I know it with the amount I watch
I'm farming up a Magnamalo in Monster Hunter Rise (think very spicy cat). It refuses to drop its' 3% chance gem.
I need one more gem for one last Handicraft deco. >:I
I'm 82 Magnamalos deep at this point.
Fair. My Sword and Shield needs the Handicraft deco to just barely get into a sliver of white sharpness, and then I'm using the decos that give me 90 seconds of unlimited sharpness after sharpening.
The Daora Switchaxe can get white sharpness pretty easily with like, one handicraft.
I'm a bowgunner. I don't see a problem with Daora. Haha.
I'm terrified of the Valstrax. Not because I die to the ambush ( I don't), but, I'm terrified of it because public lobbies die to it repeatedly.
mh rise? pumped for sunbreak
will need to shake off some rust soon
I'm HR 247 at this point. Def getting Sunbreak.
feel like i've had launches like that. sometimes your heart just isnt in it
I think that I've just barely surpassed my MH Gen HR at this point. And I need to get to like.. 380 to surpass my MH4U HR.
i think I'm actually around 380 in rise
I went through 3U with nothing but a Heavy Bowgun.
i loved 4u
Online didn't exist yet, but I did all of the 3U online stuff solo. With a HBG.
i can understand that
My dainty hands are perfect for the 3DS.
sucks. ive felt that way about my switch, but i bought a grip that helps
Anyways. For the S&S set, I'm remaking my old Teostra S&S set, as it had some redundancies, and wasn't really a mixed set yet, not truly.
i prefer docked mode for sure, just like the option
It now consists of: Blast Attack III, Protective Polish III, Evade Extender III, Speed Sharpening III, Critical Eye II (not super relevant, incidental), Handicraft 3 because the Teostra S&S just barely gets a sliver of white sharpness from III, Teostra Blessing II, Crit Boost I (incidental), Fortify I.
So, blast attacks. Normally you get like.. one blast off every.. Minute or so? I get 1-3 blasts off per S&S combo.
Well yeah, hence why I said that.
1-3 blasts per combo is insane.
By giving actually decent weapons that have status on them.
Instead of like.. 130 power dual blades.
Do you mind if I spout builds at you? I like sharing this stuff.
Like, I'd like to share my LBG build, but don't want to keep throwing numbers at you.
I have min-maxed my Zinogre LBG to that absolute maximum that it can be. Literal perfect Talisman and everything.
Bow S-tier and so fun
Spare Shot III, Normal/Rapid Up III, Ammo Up III, Reload Speed III, Recoil Down III, Rapid Fire Up III, Evade Extender III, Counterstrike II.
Yea for real HR 380 and i dont have a single �god� talisman
I can easily swap Evade for Ballistics if I want, but typically don't.
Love my zooms.
And my nyooms.
Welcome back Phantom
Rapid Morph.
Daora Switchaxe: Protective Polish III, Focus III, Speed Sharpening III, Wirebug Whisperer III, Rapid Morph III, Power Prolonger II, Constitution II, Evade Extender II, Crit Eye I, Dragon Attack I (redundant, incidental), Handicraft I, Marathon Runner I, Stamina Surge I.
Yeah it is. Haha.
I have so much fun with the mix sets in Rise. They're so good compared to older games.
Building a new set is my favorite type of puzzle.
I can't remember if I've previously mentioned that in like, 4U, I farmed just over 8,000 Black Gravios to get a single gosh darn Black Gravios heart.
key be like: HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream
Yes it is.
I had max zenny several hundreds of times over.
From all those parts.
Here goes Magnamalo 83. Wish me luck!
The desire sensor in MH games for me is real.
It's so unforgiving.
It's real for me, all of the time.
The second I get one gem, it'll drop four of them.
hehe i got 6.9 k points :3
and now it went up to 7k -_-
No gem. Two plates though. >:I
you planing of doing a rando if the run dies?
stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence
Do you wanna know how many plated I have?
best character
Seventy freaking six.
Oh I plan to.
Or, or it could not die
anything can happend
green station can't wa-
Very clean #84. No gem.
This video game is going to give me that which I desire. >:I
Oh god. I ran out of Normal 2's in my box, from fighting this thing.
I keep about 10k stocked at all times.
Yes, Meine Fuhrur.
Bad joke? :(
I'm German. I couldn't help myself.
I spelled Fuhrer wrong.
I blame Magnamalo.
So, wanna know where all my luck goes to?
Spare Shot for the LBG.
It has a 20% chance of activating with Spare Shot III.
It feels like it activates 80% of the time.
That's where my luck goes.
I'm not complaining, but like, that's where ALL of my luck goes.
My record is 31 Spare Shot procs in a row.
#85 complete. No gem.
It really does not. I'm used to this.
We press on! #86.
#86 done. No luck.
Can we hit 100? ;_;
I mean, I might as well at this point.
It's fine. it's adding up the LBG hunts on my Guild Card.
did you get the jam?
don't forget it
go fast
thats what they all say
so 3dw 2p on saturday?
even more pog
We love successful coin flips
Hahahaha. Oh my god. So, I'm fighting #87 and I accidentally hit a Jaggi with two slicing shots. The Magnamalo then hit it with a tail uppercut. The Magnamalo SENT THAT JAGGI TO THE SHADOW REALM. I know this, because I could see the slicing shot numbers going off about.. oh... 6,000 miles under the world.
someone else actually reached out to me about doing 2p runs that wasnt in our immediate freind group
Also, no gem.
Nice gold.
aggro ass bee
i bee with you hehe
When you're under less pressure from Paper Mario, please do read my above message when you have a chance.
I'm dying of laughter.
its melvin, that eu guy that crushed the 2p boards earlier
No worries. I understand that you're a wee bit focused.
he asked as if he needed any credentials for it and stated his any% time which is jokes cause i know that man is goated at 2p
Like, I knew that the small monsters can get sent to the Shadow Realm, but, I didn't expect it to be down that far.
the funny thing is i would do the same thing cause im awkward af for collabs
im down to race ya in park any% after if ya want
I think that I'm gonna take a break after #88. My head is starting to hurt.
yeah im rusty af in any% i completely forgot you can save and quit in lava zone until i saw brady do it in the bingo race
good keep saving time and such
parakarry had some trouble
#88 done. No gem. Break time.
I have so many Friend Vouchers now.
All of the Talisman farming.
I'm gonna finagle a snack together.
I should hope so.
bruh, Bowser has the Star Rod
he could've fixed that window a long time ago
There's a hall there?
yeah, cuz there's probably still glass on the floor
if he ain't wished the window fixed, he sure as heck ain't vacuumed
Cinnamon bun. :D
Oh, it is pretty good right now.
I try to eat healthy, but, I feel like I've earned this. LuL
Add a small bit of chicken for something extra?
Hmm.. Maybe I'll make a salad for dinner tomorrow too. The idea is sounding better and better by the minute.
spinach > lettuce
I'm not a fan of spinach, but I LOVE Brussels Sprouts.
I use spinach in place of lettuce
I totally agree.
spinach cooked into the yolk of an omelet
You ever just bonk actual Kooper there because he pissed you off that day?
Kooper isn't Goombario
Phantom would 1000000000000% whack Goombario
Bombette down there like Charmander in the early Pokemon episode where its' trainer didn't want it, like.. "He's coming back, right?"
Welp. Now that I've had my snacco, I'm gonna go punish myself by playing DBD.
Good luck with the rest of the run!
i don't get it why bowser have more clown carts?

NI NO KUNI?
do we really need to kill zelda if they're just botw posting now
give me more top down games if you're not going to do anything close to TP's quality for the 3d ones please
The remake for LA was really good but the base game was just mid
why was there naked people for 2 seconds
FF16 looks epic
thats it
I'm ngl I don't really care for the current final fantasy combat style
It just feels too damage spongey to make anything really satisfying
good to have you back, I popped in yesterday but mobile data was shit
Berseria felt really good to me, just had to position my people well and my big hits usually actually did damage to health bars
click bait tweet lmao
playstation 4 is gonna be rad
it's been out for so long and yet nobody has one still
did you get your day 1?
i played miles, GT7, and Kena
you would had to wait to play miles on ps4
elden ring is the only open world game i've ever enjoyed
do you know how the lzs trainer works in new fp?
botw can suck my re-hashed 3 mechanics dick
too many streams I wanna watch rn >_<
komari starting exe4
me right now
one of my friends was streaming pape rando today but he was using the other tracker. Was first time I saw someone not use yours. I like how small everything was leaving more space in the overlay, but yours is just so much cleaner.
yeah, was just my gut reaction
what was your highlight for combo breaker
yo glgl
i cant wait to work every day for the rest of my life :)
it's been chill at least tho
i have a 45 min commute each way until i move into a new place in early july where it'll be 5 mins instead
so it'll be nice to have another 1.5 hours back in my day
that sounds lit
there is always bn6 buster only KEKW
fat run
the last letter?
or the first?
ah okay
that one sucks ass
yeah having saves makes practice so easy
youve almost caught up to mitzi shes getting portrait now
timers are 7 minutes off, this race is intense
its a race to me
you just gave her a handicap
yeah sp[lit after peach
I meme about it
why cant we all just have the same splits Sadge
"strimer u forgotz 2 splitz agin"
Hai hai.
monday I wanted to do rando but didnt have time so I made a seed for next time so I can just go lol
I see green.
oh also, mark and I are doing rando race tues, wanna join?
we havent picked a time yet
normally I work on sundays so need to find other times for races lol
how does it learn?
damn she just go tthe key
you so close
yeah before I do my first run I want to look over intermidiate route and see if theyre anything i wanna go for
what about bombette in the pit?
i might be confusing routes then
i do remember seeing routes where they use her in the pit
nmb that mustve been it
bro, im no fake gamer
eating mushroom is the best 7 seconds you can spend in a first few runs
oh i just rmemebed
dont I need a windows 98 for that?
i remember having a windows 95 as a kid
then 98 was a huge deal
I hate lantern ghost
he gave me goombario once
so what is the strat using watt on lantern?
I failed 3 power shocks in a row!!!
like turn 1 powerr shock?
oh no she reset
she was in toy box but wasnt paying close attention
she threw lantern KEKW
i get that too
ezekiel is a good dog
shared a jade jungle remix you need to hear in #music
tonight im gonna look at the file that came on my jpn cart
yeah, risch did that once with exe6, they traded all the recovs so he couldnt beat gregar LMAO
cool thing about bn is its not just folder build but navicust too
is it faster take stairs or hit lava at the end there
sometimes i get an error when I boot my everdrive, I just reset til it works
I got it with a loaded card so have been using that
How long have you been running PM?
I�ve been looking into learning TTYD glitchless, but I enjoy watching runs of both games.
ttyd gless is a fucked up run
but i enjoy it a lot
i'd enjoy it more if it didn't take 6.5 hours
Exactly. I'd want to take a few weeks to learn the routing well before going for runs in TTYD
i do a run every few weeks just to keep fresh, but it requires too much time to do more often
theyre fine yeah
they're a little clunky, but they work well
power bounce in TTYD is weird always imo. this game feels better
if you're gonna do a gless run let me know, theres a route change you should 1,000% do
I felt that with power bounce when moving to PM after playing TTYD a lot
What do you enjoy more at the moment?Speedruns or Randomizer for PM?
I found your stream through your randomizer runs on YouTube.
Yep, I get that lol
The first game I tried to learn to speedrun was Sunshine the cutscenes and everything at the start was too long for me lol
I enjoyed my casual play throughs of it, it's a really fun game
My wife who never plays video games even played through it with me
I gotta head to bed since I get up early for work (I'm on EST). I'll probably watch the replay of the vod tomorrow though. Keep up the good pace!
getting pretty tired, plan is nap for 2 hours then stream but well see how that goes lol
thanks for the stream
good luck
yo gl
thicc door 1
yeahm unblock claw, charge, switch to bow, bounce/outta sight > bounce

or para
parakarry fight is a scam
yeah if you have super watt it helps
turbo charge clutch
did you just eat the life shroom
unblocked fire does 9 iirc
gg man
that was a sick run
blame the bad run on the Malort's
better than apple cider vinegar
this is rando, mate
no prologue around these parts
all my homies hate prologue
call the file Malort's
you should be able to sell badges in rando
more coins based on their BP
A fuzzy threw it in the ? Block cuz it knows Kooper lacks hops
HECK YEAH, DUDE
that's gross
Mario HATES Repel Gels
he's a diva who wants EVERYONE to see him
wanna say yeah, it was Koopa Village
professional dodger
*one slap* bitch
gl gamer
I heard from Axl that you're doing BN4 after this run
yeah same, I had a good pace run for the first 30m in my last run
like insane pace actually
but then the next 3 splits were trash
both bad RNG and some misplays on my end
Simply eat bowser
reverse bowsers inside story
tomorrow's the last chance for BN4 COPIUM
yeah switching to 5 because I got bopped there
NGO Pog
BN5 is chill, has every possible RNG in BN basically
It's gonna be 10 fp
@buff00n I'm subbed so I outrank you so you shush

he speaks
y'know goombario would be able to help knock them down
it's in the pit

I need him to start morbing again
morph could never
MegaDie? I've heard of that band.
I don't even listen to heavy shit I listen to symphonic and power lol
Watching pokemon runs and thinking, "why is pignite's cry a wet fart?"

I mean it's just so adorable
I met iwata before
he was a good man
we played each other in Mario kart
I was up till 5 cause stomach issues then called out of work because I had to be there at 9 and like I didn't want to at that point
man I still miss him
We already had people there so I don't feel too bad about it I was just there to help with a load
the toad is telling you secrets
Burger king is doing gay burgers now

He lost to steve and had enough
I had the perfect response to Taco's tweet
I was about to tell you that reply was really good LOL
Plant RT'd it now all of minnesota will see double weed
wait until triple weed, people will shit themselves
I was originally going to send Taco a different response
that is an actual sentence I'm proud of you @PhantomGamesBot
how tf you speeding a draft
I'm going to card war
you're a grown ass man, read the card text.
i swear i am sober

Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
I think that was the fastest I've reacted to one of those LOL
also "mountviewers . com" Flushed
didn't even get a chance to buy any aceari4NormanSadge
no space between . and com
this is a family friendly stream no mounting viewers
now if only they could send weed Mario
from sending weed mario?
Looked at strive mods to see if they had any good millia colors and every mod is just horny
I just want a good purple one I don't need to see barefoot millia mods
I don't think the slight modification worked
How is there nothing but purple for smash mods but I can't find a single good purple mod for strive
oop there's the nude mods
why are these here
where's the nude Wario mod?
the cowards haven't given me that power yet
Ok found 1 good mod that's just one of her reds from xrd that looks nice
WHY IS THERE LIKE 5 VARIANTS OF THE NUDE MOD
I KEEP SCROLLING AND MORE SHOW UP
we were looking through mods and found a comment on one of them and they asked where Nude Wario was and it got liked and upvoted
ok I found a good purple fucking finally
At the bottom of the page someone made an alt that's of my unist character
ooo they made ones for all of eltnums alts too
evo tweet is interesting
"Evo is grateful to share that we have been working with Sony PlayStation, Epic Games, and our developer partners to reduce input latency for many of your favorite fighting games! Please expect more updates to follow as Evo works towards a more responsive future for the FGC."

what comes out of state so i found you here on twitch :D
mx_four: what comes out of state so i found you here on twitch :D
your bot has done a lot of ezekiel roleplay
EzekielHD : You have allowed Ezekiel2 to twist your mind, until now... until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy. Ezekiel : Don't lecture me, EzekielHD ! I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear Ezekiel2 as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire. EzekielHD : Your new empire?

bombette misses the ch7 switch if she is on top of it
it is very funny
i mean literally on top
i did that a few weeks ago lmfao
i hope your chat is more helpful than mine
who the fuck voted against me
i chose to be helpful (this time)
look at that sceptile
i've lurked a bit
that's what I bought jesse last year
but i do not know what the fuck is going on
Pikachu is making friends and kicking ass
45x better than arceus
i did NOT have fun
i defended it when it came out but god it's not fun lmao
45 minutes of text mashing and i wanted to quit
that voice for mew is awful i'm offended
let's go is so good
Oh yea I got to play brady on wednesday
ive heard of this game but never seen it before
We only played a few games, the first one was close then I 3 stocked him a couple times lol
He's solid but he didn't have an answer for when I had answers to him
no but I assume it's frowned upon by god
hey dont call me out like that
it's shameful whether or not this other guy exists
are glitchless attempts shameful or painful
Ok I went through all that to get my purple millia but I've ended up liking this red and white one the most anyways lol
It's just the same colors as my Titania alt for ike in ult
dark red and white kinda just works for me
I'll send you a pic of the alt
When talking to jibca about fe9 and 10 he said "You can't tell me that Titania isn't the most perfect woman to come out of FE"
the bot is being abused in komaris stream
that was accurate footage of me buying my giant plush at combo breaker
at this point in paper mario we are talking to goompa
I've been told sf6 is gonna have macros for command inputs and I don't think there's been any shown drawbacks to using them yet so that's a bit wack
But those are needed to balance move accessing it's just going to be worse to have them on
Ok that's a bad drawback LOL
Hai hai. : D
oddish might have the most stereotypical high pitched asian woman voice ive ever heard
I did. On #91. But as we discussed, naturally, not only did I get one gem, but I got two from #91. Naturally.
croagunk is like a 15 year old who's been downing 2 packs a day since he was 5
he is also frogkin
I told you. It always works that way.
What is your least favorite section of this game and why is it the Mew jump?
this was a pathetic showing
that mf won worlds
But yeah, I finished my Teostra S&S set off of that Magnamalo gem. I also made a Bazelguise Dual Blade set by changing a couple things out for Marathon Runner and I then got an insanely good Talisman. Evade Extender III + Counterstrike I + a 3 slot deco slot.
God tier Talisman. : D
OBSTACLE HOP MY BELOVED
YO HE GOT HOPS
I'm still waiting for the obstacle hop.
I didn't see any obstacles, nor any hopping.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wish I had optimal friends
I just have buff00n
he loses me a lot of time with his late ass
y'know I can't call him dumbass now without thinking of that carride and what jesse said
the clowncar was a curse
I did not go into combo breaker thinking we couldn't fit in a car because buff00n had a dumpy
ok i don't miss that part of smash
yea so m4 that whole weekend we had buff00n driving and 4 of us in the back and it was ok
Then 1 ride we let proc drive instead and we genuinely couldn't fit in the back anymore
Buff00n isn't even large he's a very average sized person
he just has a dumpy
I always think that's a partner badge at first glance
yes im partner now
the first streamless partner
Technically that was jesse
Cause he never streamed without partner
Panda just said here you go
woah is this the secret Paper Mario 64 chapter?
Did you play through the new Pokemon Snap, by chance?
while I was in the back, TacoGuyy STAYED slamming into me every chance he got
Oh, yeah. I felt that too.
"Just took a dump on the run so I'm excited to see how that goes lol "
"you are now friends" -bashes them into the water-
are you REALLY friends if you DON'T make them eat shit every now and then???
taking you to child hell
you know about drifloon picking up children right?
I tried to time 'em out, but Taco was too quick on the draw
He was playing splattytoon
Love live game LMFAO
There is 1 on the ps4
is there one that isn't a gacha
ain't playing no love live game
That has $150 plus worth of dlc
your setting a bad example for the bidoof
Grandma wants to fight
why do no gios like to block
I'm just doing fake shit and they keep getting counterhit
Taco race me and Phantom in Park tm

Gio has an anti-air dp
It's a 6p but big
feraligatr holdin ya back
ok I guess ky dp sucks
I misinputed an airdash and I just went through it entirely LOL
more like bitch zone
the first hit of may super off counterhit 2h
I hate it here
at least let me die to the full thing
millia please eat your wheaties
now i'm playing a floor 10 leo with level 2 thousand
he's going to mash help
@TacoGuyy try turning it off and on?
when he does back turn dash
he literally just appears there
it was just gamble between grab and block overheard
I took a round though because I hit him once and he kept DPing
this dudes message says "Jack-o thigh enjoyer"
oh boy a level a billion ram
Glalie got no hoes
why are you beating his ex wife
ok that justifies it
Ezekiel3 is down NOOOOO
I love his run cycle
he just go boing
I'm looking at the sonic frontiers gameplay and why did they slowdown sonic so much
This is the game where you want to just fucking run around and they didn't want to do that
they have auto turnaround
mawile of a shoyo
regardless how Frontiers' is received critically, I'd like Sega to review what works/doesn't work when making the next Sonic game
but, this Sega. so
They literally just have to make sonic move fluid and fun and make a world that's fun to move around in
But that's too hard
How's it that literally everyone has an idea of what they want Sonic to be BESIDES Sega???
the comics are killing it
the movies have performed phenomenally
like all they had to do to make frontiers a fun game is just make sonic move fast and responsive and let him run around the mountains and shit
the Mania devs said "we wanna make a Classic Sonic game" and they did
But he's slow as fuck lol
Like the whole thing that makes the old sonic games good is how they play with momentum
You have to path things so that you can keep your momentum and they let you go fast for it
Now you just go on rails and hit a boost button sometimes
Rush series lacked momentum, but the charm was keeping your boost gauge filled as you blasted through the stage at full speed
Hell, Modern Sonic was just Rush but 3D, but Sonic refused to let it stand on its own
see: Werehog, Wisps, Classic Sonic then Classic plus the OC thing in Forces
if a Sonic game was just Modern stages from Generations the entire game, people probably would've loved it
but Sega refused to let Modern gameplay stand on its own merits
do me afavor a get a pb thanks
do me a favor and reset
hiiii dude all three bug fables plushy got funded in like 8 hours it's crazy!
I'm buying a vi one
obviously, I ordered all of them :)

deadMario deadMario deadMario deadMario
he couldn't handle the weed
I don't think so?
I don't remember a golem voice
Twink <- a murderer
why is he a murderer? lol
I haven't heard that one even in pm64 speedrunning back in the day
deadMario he's fucking dead
twink fuckin killed him
Twink look at this face
a cold blooded killer
why is twink giving brain damage?
you know I expected that meme to be way better :(
Any game mod that removes leggings/stockings from a character is downgrade in my eyes
Brand new WHAT Flushed
I'm going to pop that balloon
Damn this is actually kinda intense
Cuz all it takes is someone's wifi to slip up and the run is over
wait where the smash bros at .. also ub going to double down
im a throwe :)
I threw so hard
huff happened and i cri
but HEY 22:09 new gold for prologue so yay
gonna get some food brb
back with food :3 so this speedrun requires two people?
Mario's not allowed in 2P speedruns cuz he says "OH, SHIT" every time he gets the crown
this game feels like toads treasure tracker but on steroids
just gold every split and boom sub 2 hrs yeah? Kappa
I've been influenced by the influencer
toad kitty is cute
head a little mishapen but other than that CUTE
Are you having fun? : D
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
i couldnt think of what to say lol
I've awakened from my nap
something about golem operating a machine is hilarious
you wont believe what I found
my old megaman battle network 5 player guide LUL
I found mine for red/blue, emerald, and platinum
about to grab some food
i little self conscious about not adding more, but im not beating myself over it.
rando race is about to start but I skipping today, kinda exhausted rn
I was gonna do glitchless runs today but then i took a nap and ate an edible so... not happening lmao
i just did one yesterday and didnt have the drive to finish
paper mario needs swords MissedASword
leave it. it's perfect
its fine, you said youll be starting bn3 anyways KEKW
im just here to remind you I didnt forget LUL
wasnt dinglez the only one to complete a SS run?
@Axl_Sensei good stuff on commentary earlier
i just came back with food, did you forget to reset before starting?
yo! thanks buffoon. Glad you were able to catch it
My brain doesnt register prologue if I'm being completely honest
I wanna do a prologue marathon
though recently ive been trying to focus on my spin timing and lines for prologue
How many prologues can I do in 5 hours?
i am looking forward to having taquitos for dinner oh muh goodness
im running mashed potatoes, mushroom soup, and hamburger
oh that sounds good too axl
I average 11:07 goombario clintB
sub 11 goombario soon? BLANKIES
a whole year :O that's how you know all the tech
aww damn, bn3 is the follower goal. Gonna be waiting a hot minute for that
he is doing his best
My average prologue is 22:14 papeHands
But I mean I have been running it for less than a month so I guess that aint too bad LUL
im confused. I have a prologue split at 21.28... that cant be right
maybe I split at the summit?
Axl the prologue god ayo?
no switch is trash
you said 2209 LUL
I said 2209 about me
he def said 22:03
least likely? okay Mr. Seventh Try Speedy
axl really has it out for you tonight LUL
trying to will all sorts of bad rng into existence for you
truer words never spoken
good rng x2 to balance it out
its expensive to wish ill on the run
I have an arm chair behind me and Hikari is so cozy sleeping in it rn
is mario tripping in a fight rng?
dont thunderbolt the bullet bill KEKW
i forgot black was an original color lol
holy that chapter 1
gonna lay down with the stream, whether I fall asleep will remain to be seen
i woke up at 6am, thats not normal for me
normally I got to bed at 6am LUL
that means carpet clean %
ive done a run once, they did a showcase for bn 20th annivesary, and now today
i have no idea
terra asked me to commentate
I just ignored it
no one has any interest
i just did it as a proof of concept
i did it on english actually was a while bad
i finished a run, shared my splits "hey guys I did the thing"
"axl, we made a board so go ahead and submit it" i did it out of obligation
i feel so uncomfortable about that board
they always say "1 run is a challenge run,2 is a race, and 3 is a board"
also it was mostly blind with SS route
its cringe to watch too
if you saw the license fights
B license has magnet and ice panels
A license has lava and poison panels
so it is legit harder
but after A license the rest is cake
ice fights dont even change
all otherr script encounters change
like the triple beetank you saw komari one shot with dash
the becomes 2 beetank with howitzer int eh front row
dash goes thru howitzer so the beetanks are free
also null and void is easier cause no null and void
could you imagine 3 null and void with 330 HP with how they regin
honestly the hardest fight is mole
give you the pop up chip
in vanilla they have 10 HP and can only dmg them 1 HP per hit
in hard mode they have 15 HP
so have to use whirlpool or darkhole
they were going for the whack-a-mole gimmick
also when messing with the incomplete bn2 rando I got pop up on the tutorial, if one runs you have to do the fight over.
the 2ndround took me 45 minutes to complete OMEGALUL
if you get a script encounter and they run its free
if its in a gauntlet you have to start overr
i enjoyed the bn2 rando cause I know the game so well, but that only lasted for so long
i really liked the unique folder builds, like once I had a kunai folder. Super cool cause its more of a late game chip you never see.
bn2 was basically shuffle everything... bn3 on the other hand even changes dmg values
like ive seen a 20dmg varsword LMAO
they even change the name of the chips and navi/virus names. Seen an alphabug called KEKW
been thinking about how I want to do my splits
leaning toward enter fortress/runis/castle ect.
my old splits have some 3 minute splits and I hate that
yeah, I want to drop "prison break" too
yeah, my airman split is really short around 3 minutes but thats cause of doghouse.
if not for that it would be one split
you saw komari suffer in doghouse?
today was rough first fishy was like 4th encounter, I think 6 encounters to finish?
we took a break before starting mother comp, I told komari to run to doghouse and grind for dash * LUL
also hard mode started late cause runner overslept
you just 5 cap?
when isnt that in beginner route?
i guess 4 and 3 is easier
oh was wondering about a mid split for chapter4, gourmet guy fills that nicely
i think id split on last audio cue of him eating cake
ive seen some swap to bow in yellow house, dont know whats faster
i know jcog's old video guide said swap in the forest
im not the kinda guy to practice room but I might change my mind
but all the green
that same thing happened to me in last rando
i really need to learn LP blocks
i hear its impossible on switch
you carry the peril here from jr right?
oh duh! you just took dmg from him
is it not worth using turbo charge or do we not have enough FP for it?
if peach was smart once she got outside hit the blue switch and take the pipe to toad town LUL
everytime I see this part Im reminded of Jeny's clip lol
#clips for your viewing pleasure
i told komari about this...
I had a dream last night him and dalus rolled up at my house to pick me up for gdq LUL
all the checks... axlsenCoward
even the life shroom?
whats the hidden blick then? a repel gel?
so weird not seeing exp dropped
i like it from the design side of punishing you from running, but honestly hate it
oh thats why you hate it LUL
can I just say... fuck that yellow fuzzy
"do what you did?" thats like saying "git gud, copy tas faker gamer"
checking in on hard mode to see where they are at
need to check my hard mode notes
almost 3 hours in and on A license
so not even cutman
fullfire, beetank2 and puffball, with a rockcube on each side is the last fight for A license, its soo bad
also bn2 hard mode is locked behind 10 secret chips which require pvp, and to get those both players need at least 3 title screen stars
thankfully wiiU patch fixed this
pvp was cool tho, there were so many randomly generated fields
oh no, his first visit to yum square he went to the correct warp panel last. This is a casual run with a timer on the gdq stage
and 2.4K people are watching this #socringe
they needed terra to do commentary cause no one else would.... almost like theres a reason for that LUL
komari finished his run before they finished A license, also gdq taking breaks doesnt help much
gl Phantom propokH /
i feel if a run is less than 3 hours it shouldnt need a break but thats me
is it weasle stomping day?
Hikari heard some thunder so she went into hiding
there was one yesterday
it completely missed here thankfully
we got light rain for 15 minutes
i messed with dk64 rando, not sure how I feel about it
I can see why this place can be terrible for rando with the amount of fetch quest required propokM
youd hate it for sure lmao
chapter 6 or the whole game?
id imagine id like chpater 6 cause less rooms to learn
yeah i see that
with my stick mash I hold controller with left hand and mash stick with side of middle on right hand
i wish bombette had stick mash LUL
I'm real bad at button mash...even worse with my worn thumbs :/
this game should be fun to learn :)
my button mash is so bad, the very reason I wont grind this game for top time
oh? didnt know that
Better lucky than good 4Head
okay, I've made a wrap/burrito and consumed it
also nice sneeze LUL
i know that feel
my ginger beer just explode onto my lap
once I PB'd with elec shield, I didnt split on gospel cause I didnt want it to PB LUL
random after this run?
what time is best for you on tue? I havent picked a time for mark yet
yeah, mark is streaming rn so ill hit him up later tonight
my friend recommended me zero sugar ginger beer after they brought to my attention that one bottle of regular gb is usually 90+% worth of daily sugar intake
phantom what is this mmbn2 run on gdq? it looks like a prank or something i dont get what they're doing
its a casual run on gdq stage
that's what it seems like
also phantom why'd you pick me out?
@Axl_Sensei are you for real
it looks like my first time playing but with "i have to beat it quikly" as my main goal
obvious they guy playing doesnt know bn2
thats what it is
did they make it to quickman yet
last I checked they were at cutman at 3 hours
"have you played bn before?" No
"do you know what bn is?" no
my blind hardmode run took 4:15
buff, make that a quote pls
and dont forget the PERFECT
finally a mod I can count on
I was gonna do a command
i wanna see phantombot say that LUL
or get TacoGuyy if I can't figure it out
@Tacoguyy your ass has been summoned
you said you submitted everything
im expecting you to do 6 runs there
phantom, viewership went up. There are 2.6K watching KEKW
PGB bragging about how good he is at BN LUL
is it bn2 or bn5?
terra even invited jameike on hard mode commentary and the man has NEVER touched bn2
considering the runner has no experience, I suppose it's appropriate
wait, right, you actually gotta play through Bowser's Castle
they cut the stream at shadowman and raided etchy
at that rate, they were gonna be there a WHILE
there was confusion, staff thought it was 4 hours but eta was 6 hours. 4 hours at shadowman is only half the run so I dont blame them
that's some slick movement
would you be interested in an actual hard mode speedrun?
so they just mery killed it? lol
oh? komari is going back to bn5
gonna jump over some questionable hitboxes are ya?
good times great oldies
the odds of 7 are hilariously low
do the quick kammy kill strat
"quick kammy kill" say that 3 times fast
did you get double 3 apped?
so whats bowser at now?
i haz cheese cake snack
peach wish harder!! phanto274BigRage
after this is a blind mmbn2 hard mode run
I can coach over VC
axl an hook you up
then full blind run, llets goo
ill do it blindfolded, only audio
real talk tho, I legit wanted to do a bn2 coaching with me only having audio
sends phantom clip "copy this rng manip"
bn6 rando? no way, get the fuck out!
would been fun with a rando
okay im done memeing
strimer, you forgot to split
unless you wanna do mine early?
i just sent mine over
thats what I intended
yeah just shop and key
im gonna have m4 do this too LUL

here's everything you'll need
streamer, looks like your enjoying my seed KEKW
HorseRide <- I like this
tried Strikers. it's decent. Refuse to purchase it until Daisy's arrives.
no daisy in strikers is criminal
As a Christian, I cannot condone this sacrilege
Buff00n is in fact my wholesome church friend according to a single white mom in illinois
Said white mom adores me
I peaked at the alt after combo breaker and I'm not gonna anymore
it is i think
race rules are a mystery
the rules are "no fun allowed" so probably banned
I hate fun
that bitch green as fuck
imo race rules should be "does it break logic?" "if yes, it's banned"
what if my logic is not liking fun
that requires me to know so much logic tho
I don't remember that one
you love to see it
after one I have to
hey, he earned that
phantomgamesbot is always here
why's the tree glowing
you schmooved on that guy
you run from shy guy he despawns?
what triggers the check for the mayor?
whats with all these fire flowers
how do they grow fire flowers in the snow covered land?
every check cant be god tier now
does that let your partners use focus? Never knew that was in this
i just got 3 cap jr in practice LOL
love having parakerry for this
a moment ago you were asking "what is this seed" look at you now
i think it should be, it only skips textboxes
an old spirit in burried ruins? makes sense to me Kappa
whats a hitbox? phanto274Shrug
felt like a good beginner seed
its fun to go nuts on LP
volcano has a bunch of checks too
put her back in the lamp
was waiting on that one LUL
Sad that we got the goomba
that shy guy tried so hard
im imagining general guy yelling at his troops for missing like that
just get lucky strats
1.41 to get a card oof
Toy Story 2 yeah LUL
super mega rusty lol
nice gl with that! I wanna try this randomizer eventually
gotta head out but have fun with the run!
of course! and you too! :)
blue key isnt required for chpater 7?
can finally get a hammer
I saw in rando discord someone had kooper in that mailbag check phanto274Facepalm
crazy how that was the first place it wanted you to go
having laki lets you skip bubble berry is nice
that looked like an erotic cake Kappa
Cley just finished and reviewed zelda 2
Just beat Zelda 2. the game was shit 0/100 I never want to touch shit fuck game ever again.
Bitch had rewind too

this storeroom put me in go mode
this seed is "up and down and all around"
not too much, how's it going? haha all good, it's roopa
There's a zelda 2 defender in cleys mentions
i've been peepin for a minute, seems like a lot of "hm" moments LUL
i think the only partner i saw was bombette on rip
oh shit i didn't see para there too lol
this is the quickest I completed a seed so I wanted phantom to do it
there's no such thing as a "quick" seed
i have a hard time passing up the star stone check lol
oh! i had a mushroom so I swaped with life so they all matched LUL
My family safeguard weed for centuries. And now, I entrust you; Mario, to roll a fat blunt
the bat chose death
yo? almost enough for another rando seed
buff00n, how about I send this seed back in but just change the file name Kappa
damn, I tabbed out and missed crystal king
so my order was 1 4 5 6 7 2 and 3 last
9.1k points let's go
I have to go to bed within the hour, but you should be done by then
imagine if you skipped lantern and did that now Kappa
how can a ghost hit a physical object?
watch this be bubble berry

i just noticed something... the hud is purple and just so happened to match your layout
finally can put repelgjel to work
reminds me of mark's 10 cap fight

jenysrPogslide jenysrPogslide jenysrPogslide GG

YOUR MARRIAGE IS IN SHAMBLES
thanks for fulfilling my dumb request
SHE'S TAKING THE KIDS
Raid your local, your favorite people :)
funny how the only item you skipped was in the very first shop
I'm playing strive tomorrow
From the Hebrew name (Yechezqel) meaning "Round-ass bird", from the roots (chazaq) meaning "very" and ('el) meaning "fucking round". Ezekiel is a major prophet of Chapter 5, the author of the Kolorado letter. He lived in Yoshi Village until the babies wouldn't shut the fuck up, at which time he soared across the ocean.
