good luck
I'm excited to try this
yoo glgl
nice peril manip
restart computer!
i now have the english MM practice rom on my wii
english is faster for any% nmg/unrestricted for various reasons lmao
I felt that
yeah iirc english is faster for srm categories but the only one i'd run is any% unrestricted cuz it's 20 minutes long lol
definitely more interesting in nmg tho
WHOS THIS SEWER FREAK
that was the best thing i've ever fucking seen
what was that sewer man what was that
yo phantom GL HF
also thanks again for inviting me to do commentary, I had a blast
I was glad to have risch there, I couldn't have explained many things in that much detail LUL
hmm i will consider clicking the follow button
wouldn't it be funny if you got struck by lightning a third time
its comedy rules of threes, itll happen
Hai hai, you wonderful person, you. :D
I'm alright. Did I come in at a weird time? LuL
Not.. AT ALL? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Side note: I made tacos. :D
Naturally, I made enough for everyone.
Go pick that badge up, mister. >:I
Badges have feelings too.
That badge is going to be dwelling on that all day long ... like ... Damn ... I can't believe that Luigi(?) didn't want me ... That's harsh ...
oh no ... gosts
guess who got a raphnet today?!
and they work together!
setup was a pain
kept mapping start to hammer
don't laugh!
That flower just destroyed you, and then gave you pity money that it stole from your pocket while you were distracted.
I just woke up tho and have to get ready for work. I'll explain more stuff later over discord
have fun gamer
Ah yes. The shyghosts.
I like that you had to go the mansion to get that.
When the game is kind-of? vanilla.
Nice Sushi colors.
Haven't seen that one before.
why do you look flat
pokeball sushie
I'm kidding. Don't hate me. ;-;
In before they're all chilling in a single corner of the flower field?
Did you already hug Act 1?
Right. Forgot if you can set the bridge to be down by default or not.
This is a pretty rude chapter six placement.
she water on my block til i squirt
What the **** did I just read?
The game is making you do some things that you don't want to do. LuL
Have you fought the early dojo fights?
Oh. Got'cha.
You can do it!
The real question is if you should do it.
Nice refund.
Such a weirdly strong badge.
I had no idea how good Refund was, when I was young.
Well done!
The things we do when the seed is being rude.
If you have a quote bot, I'd like to petition for adding "You better have a mailman in your pocket."
Also, that penguin had a cloud in his cupboard.
I mean, where else do you keep your cloud turtle things?
Certainly not in the sky like a savage.
It really, really wants you to go to Bowser's Castle. KEKwait
Depends on the chapter attached, I guess?
Did we thought? Did we really?
That's rough, buddy.
Thanks, windows.
Windows: Notice me, senpai. *Hides knife behind back*
My audio drivers do the big dumb every time my windows updates.
don't tell my sister
Clearly, you need star pieces.
He was thinking about it. I mean, everyone in this seed is, from what we've seen.
Luigi(?) has just pissed a lot of people off.
That's all.
you know what would make traps better
You ever just find a calculator out in the desert?
if it showed the same pickup animation for the item
annd then exploded
mario holds it above his head and gets struck by lightning
run ded
I went to get a drink of water, and I missed what?
Strugglebus, here we come!
As much as I love hanging out here, I might go play some DBD soon.
I'm ... assuming? that you don't play DBD?
I have severe anxiety to the point of having a heart that tries to physically end me. I don't bleeping know why I play DBD.
I wonder how many items you use on average in all of your Paper Mario seeds.
It really varies, though. 'Cause like ... sometimes it's a couple items due to good luck, and, sometimes it's ... a LOT of items.
how much is power bounce?
Attack FX Attic
I'd like to request turning on Attack FX A, in honor of this being quite A seed.
Oh neat.
The shyguys are on something today.
He was too powerful. They had to keep Kooper and his shell separate.
We can do chapter 1 now, right?
Oh gods. Imagine if the slot machine was in the pool.
I really want the piggos to be in the pool. >:I
Always Bow.
But, slapping the **** out of stuff.
lurking while driving
dont watch stream and drive
Why did Kooper have that?
Kooper is just an all or nothing kinda guy, you know?
He's dead, Jim.
How much is the hp plus? LuL
fire flower must pay for what it did
Hello my darling
Hello my ragtime gal
runs into the bomb jail break out expecting to come out of it alive
so ... what did all of these traps replace in the item pool?
Such as?
random lightning strikes
These Koopa bros colors. LuL
They're like an even more scuffed version of themselves.
And that's saying something.
Time for a gamba? LuL
That's a welcome party.
Are you slowly or rapidly losing your sanity? Since it's not a question of if.
For sure. Instead of just ... "We know that we have to full clear. Let's go, auto pilot!"
Bowser's elite patrol right there.
good ol' Windows bullying
was good! Finished Coromon and jumped into Boyfriend Dungeon unironically Kappa
how's the rando?
What's Assumed Fill? :o
so a more diverse logic to items?
sweet. Love me some extra rando BloodTrail
ez game Kappa
Five and a half hour seed?
that just means fun then :)
what's Assumed Fill?
I watch PM Rando, I don't keep up with the development
What is assumed fill? Well ... when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much..
The easy answer for all Rando ... ... Just Hundo the Seed 4Head Kappa
I'd like the randomizer to be able to randomize the desert "area" tiles.
I've played enough other Randos where it's happened LUL
Chomp. :O
Oh neat.
The logic for this seed has been all over the place.
This is gonna be a long one. LuL
She's just exploding with love.
f I'm late, gl hf!
assumed already giving you a wild goose chase i see
oh god is that a 'total time playing rando' timer?
im so sorry lmao
what a bro
what trap setting are you rocking
i think it's 25% of consumables then? ... something like that
booming voice there chanterelle
duude what a chain
yea okay pape, lol
was that in the cloud a maple?
dude the god combo of jump badges, what
lol, welp
you know, that tracker has a great notepad function i heard
tbf I'm also really bad at taking notes
Oh I'll probably remember that, how could I not? ... 10 minutes later ...
Ah. I succumbed to my taco food coma. How goes the seed?
Still no birb.
did AntiGuy ever have something for you?
aight gotta bounce, wish you that portrait soon lol
Give water stone to Lily in chapter 6?
Did you buy from Rip Cheeto?
Is it one of the vines?
Didn't they just add that you can give the artifact to Kolorado without finishing Ch2?
Assumed fill too hard so you had to cheat with glitches Kappa
Yep, that's what happens when things are actually random
no more easy runs
well, maybe some, but not most
ooh, that's a sick color for Peach
lurking cuz driving
nice gold Kappa
is this WABITR?
you love to see it
good luck with your first run that totally won't be able to watch
brace yourself, I've acquired Malort's
gl gamer
ngl I was surprised to find out that there are 10 falzar runs
"I don't know what Malort's is" you will come CB
you WILL
bop the boss Pog
not yet
you can put it in if you want
it's good vs diveman and aquaman
yeah it's better if it's A code
yeah trnarrw code doesn't matter in gregar
Wait, you're playing Falzar?
you can use it on elementman
in pav3
Welp time to wait for yet another cable
There's no display port so time to spend 50 bucks on a usb converter
I just want my fucking monitor so I can do anything I want to
what do you mean there is no display port and no functional hdmi
That literally wont work
the pc doesn't have it
there is 2 hdmi and a dvi
God I'm dumb they were fuckin plugged
Thank you for curing stupidity for me
yoo good luck my dude!
I believe in you
most importantly
weed mario believes in u
just imagine him with a thumbs up instead of a hand on his hip
my clip finger was ready
I love falzar for that reason. can't brute force it
thus far, Falzar seems like pain
I love it
spoutman is amazing. drip drip
do you have splits inside your splits?? sick
Why would you want it earlier when you could have it now
wait what the fuck are you
olimar lookin ass
Lance pog
it's Aquaman, or SpoutMan, cuz Capcom USA didn't want to get sued
good call
man, I love watching MegaMan just SWOOCE all over the place
you got robbed with that ElementTrap
GG yess. good job
yaa it is hard to tell at first
on a phone call, lurking
PBs were built on hope
or whatever the saying is. glgl
good evening phantom, GL HF
huh ... on my screen your name is exacltly 0.5 pixels wider than mine.
never noticed it was that close
I tried to click on you and twitch took me to the browse category list
Twitch dont want me here
ok so the one use of this tech for wario so far
huh ... now that you mention it ... yeah it is
Is nair combos like 5% longer
But we could already do that lol
Back in my day, we had to click on streams uphill both ways
The input is free at least
It's just fuck up a halfcircle by one number lol
I randomly woke up at 3am, so here I am LUL
I went to bed at 22:30 like a responsible adult *shudder*
did you find out the milk was bad before you had some?
late night gang
oh good
I've found out the milk went bad the wrong way before
would not recommend
I think I could use this for zard but that's like it lol
cause the full momentum nair input only works on nair so I could use this for back air or something
reset then
I missed half of it
wait you can just gold the button for text boxes? Must be nice Kappa
as it should be, really
Rune factory does that :)
although the way BN does it also makes a lot of sense
5 I might actually figure out a route for, the storyline seems MUCH better to run and I actually have movement tech to work with from shortswords
Shortsword charge attacks break movement it's so fun
If you do it off a hill you keep full momentum of your dash and the gravity is so low that you just go so fucking far
Hai hai.
Hai grumpypants?
You seem like you're having a time.
Oh okay. Haha.
gold though
Pape 64 (REAL)
All around me are familiar faaaces, worn out plaaaceeessss
pay the penalty
oh were we predicting? LUL
uh, sorry my phone bugged out I definitely meant 3,3,3
blame it on autocorrect
Tell us of this plan of yours.
Oh good.
What could possibly go wrong? Four hours of work, all with the possibility of catastrophic failure that could have been avoided?
that sounds horrible
speedrunners man
built differently
The self abuse.
It's fine. You've got this. First try, new PB.
I don't know if I'd still run BN if Gregar was a 50-50 LUL
But it feels longer. LuL
hmm yeah, that's a big difference
it's okay, there's plenty of time to bounce back
so at worst it's a coin flip for a PB
Congrats on the WR.
wait what
Do you think that a skip directly into the final chapter is theoretically possible? Via, I dunno, glitching into loads zones and such?
damn, that coin flip saves a lot of time Kappa
Like ... hidden under levels and such.
Just some void?
It has to be somewhere.
I love speedy spin
rip run Sadge
Ok after fiddling with the "tech" for a bit I never drop it because it's just a timed half circle and I'm only gonna use it on zard lol
Puts his tail behind him in like 2 frames so kinda want that
So, if chapter five has said trigger glitch, then ... surely the other chapters have un-discovered loadzones too?
I get that, but like, even the card has to be stored somewhere. The loadzone attached to the card is stored somewhere.
Sorry if I'm being annoying about it, but, I refuse to believe that it's impossible.
Not with that attitude.
I can now down throw up smash with zard but like
why the fuck would I ever do that
bthrow bair is same damage better position and bthrow nair sets up for 0 to death lol
I dunno. It took them like ... 20 years to skip the WW barrier.
ACE is busted
That's pretty fun.
Is there any tech in this game that is similar to a lot of the Zelda game's extended bomb boost jumps?
Also hate gimrs video because he puts a part that says "Shotos can do this" and you know what char type he doesnt show
Terry has no shoryu fireball or tatsu
Well I guess rising tackle is kind of a shoryu now in 15 but not in smash
I drank all of my orange juice, and now I'm sad. ;-; It's all gone.
Correction: I chugged all of my orange juice because it was too tasty, and I couldn't help myself.
What did Chomp ever do to you? D:
You monster.
One time is one too many. >.>
Nicely done!
Hey gl on the runs!
such a long category props to you
OH SWEET! that means alot :)
definitely LUL People usually run the pc or N64 emu version
Maybe this could help with THIS waft confirm
Thought to myself then I do it and it works if I do it perfect
But then I did it just with a dash and it worked better LOL
ok the one thing it would do is make jablock waft easier
because I dont have to do my jump input frame perfect
Void is tweeting clips of it and it's just him shitting on people who aren't anti-airing him and doing a b reverse
If I do this jaemi is going to dragdown forward air me and I am dead
fuck falco
The only useful things I've seen so far are helping bad turnaround animations and diddy kong can dtilt z drop banana if he picks it up with dtilt
But like any safe air you'd hit a shield with point blank you have a positive on the rps anyway so unless your dashback NEEDS it then why do it lol
warios dashback for example is mad fucking good because he lifts his ass up and leans immediately and his feet dont exist lol
GOLD gold
ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOUR SOUL
I'd love if you had this
cuz if you could select from 3 random items, I think that'd be hilarious
which of these items does Mario hate, Princess?:
true, that in itself is fun
Kammy places Goombario in front of chest
gl gl phanto274Bless
It's summer heat already where I live
Nicely done.
Did you draw your splits background?
Oh I see it nice
They're adding what for artists?
Oh that's pretty cool
I was born in 95 monkaS
yooo phantom gl on the run!! phanto274Bless
did you end up getting milk??
Also i hate chapter 5 Madge
not that guy. he killed my run earlier
I need to work on this chapters movement specifically.
All aboard the strugglebus!
ty for stream phantom!! Hope to catch the next one soon! peepoWave
I had a fright jar fail, jumped on fire bar, got speedied and a pokey encountered me when I was trying to bombette first strike :)
Ah. I live
I'm ... on hope
Right. Forgot if you were fuckin plugged
As much is amazing. drip
huh ... on my darling
dont want the follow button
I went to click on a drink of yours.
She's just imagine him with that
This is amazing. drip drip drip drip
One time my wii
Hey I'm driving home, so can't talk. good luck
Hopped on quickplay cause I just wanted to play and this mario was just mashing the rar shit so I went zard
He didn't live very long
he put himself at backair tipper range every time LOL
I also refuse to call this the gimr or any of the names he gave it because it's just a control stick angle lol
Yea you just corner notch after an initial dash
If you flick it you go back and if you dont you just drift in it's not really anything new lolll
Anything I've tested with this I do with just an attack cancel or full momentum nair or even just a dash and it's the same thing LOL
The only thing I'd use this for is for like fullhop back airs because you can't attack cancel that
Yea that's what I do for my bike look wavebounces
I went to the alt account to check follow requests and an anime tab pops up and it's just some cosplay girls ass
This is why I never have home page on
I literally only follow RF artists on that account and it's like 10 of them lol
I just followed like 10 artists I like most on that account so my timeline is only that and nothing else
Since that account is just for annoyed rambling I may as well have something I want to see while I'm there lol
doing a normal run i see
We should rando race sometime now that my pc wouldn't explode for it
yeah gl
what is top 15 rn?
really? damn. slopdop was top 10 when I started my grind
thank you for harnessing bad rng, it may help with the decision to run tonight
I have never recovered from absorbing morphs rng to get any% record
yeah, I would've gotten 3:46 probably
my rng is still godawful after that
i bought so much shit today!!!
mini min amiibo
monkey ball banana mania
network transmission
and a logitech litra
most recent, i got it on PS5 for 20 bucks
you will one day KEKW
I can join the next NT race LUL
EzekielSD : Alright so ... arbitrary code execution, you can jump into the blue house? And y'all got Clippy? EzekielHD : Yeah. EzekielSD : The future is crunk! EzekielHD : Anything else you wanna know? EzekielSD : Is Final Bowser too much? Am I ready? EzekielHD : I can't tell you everything. But if you want to make history, you got to charge your own jumps. EzekielSD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD + EzekielHD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD : We going to the volcano!
yeah, last one had a turn out for 7 runners
its only hard in the beginning
Ah Phantom5800, I see that you've included the partner Goombario in your party. However, I see that he's also surrounded by other trash partners. Instead why not use Goombario, the best partner in Paper Mario? It opens you up to some real all-star attacks, like Tattle and Multibonk.
Dear Twitch User Phantom5800: I noticed your chat does not contain the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. I have decided it is best to add this pasta to your chat forthwith rather than unfollow. Again, the pasta I am adding to your chat is the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. Thank You.
phantom, its happening phanto274Hype
Bored Ape #1398 Owner says buying NTFs was Biggest Regret of his life. He is unable to sell it for even a fraction of what he spent, it financially ruined him.
The collapse begins guys ...

also gl, sorry i had to get some pastas out
you gonna continue bird up or just a one and done?
thought about doing an unboxing for the litra
imagine doing unboxing for lighting without any lighting KEKW

Hai hai. :D
Bad. >:(
Grumpy bad, though.
So, it's manageable.
I see that you are pulling out all of the tricks for this.
20 bp
not possible
I'm aware.
I'm memeing.
i think 8 is most unless I'm forgetting a thing

this sounds like every rando race i've asked about lmao
holy shit that charge

i was ready for the big dumb attack but forgot the little clouds take his turn if you die
did u save yoshi's?
but what if the yoshis have weed for mario
buy goombario
mario needs that
what if partner attacks are randomized? like bomb is headbonk and headbonk is waterblock and waterblock is bom
komari is disappointed in you
"I dont really care about bird" KEKW
i mean someone had to say it
im going to head out and watch rest on vod

I've beat his ass in 3 parking lots now
i'm calling the police rn

on phantom for killing children
you threw it at jr
it's not about using it
that's funny af
it was on jr that is the problem
just time out
up and away him
just fright jar him
probably dink anyways
there should be a setting that puts good badges in out of the way places
mod bp plus so it can randomly take more than it gives
The Skollar Smooch is Hilarious
I think a nut animation specifically on bowser would be better
bowser can u not
4/20 lmao
wait sorry this is serious
shield 4 turns in a row bowser

if you tried to brute force your way with everything else you would have died
just 3 stocked Elite Smash Aegis. Thrice in a row.
the 1st three stock, I'm morally obligated to give a runback
the 2nd, I felt bad
the 3rd, I moved on
I mean, I'd want a runback if I got 3-stocked
be the change you wanna see in the world
start with the man in the mirror
we talking about YGO?
yeah there needs to be best of 3 to understand some counterplay
one game benefits shitters, who'll gladly dip after one game
I still think it's hilarious that there's like very few cards in Yu-Gi-Oh that say, "what's that, I beat you in a single game and you're expecting more? NOPE!!! I JUST WIN THE ENTIRE MATCH THERE AND THEN!" and then victory dragon proceeded to be banned.
I don't fathom how people willingly dip from a close game, and a stable connection
"Damn, they got me. I'll get them on the runback- !? THIS MF'ER LEFT!"
it's last stock, both of us kill% and dude LEAVES cuz they got their W on a rando???
fuck outta here
I wanna play
It's the Super Prologue Bros.
damn prologue just started
there are worst prologues, admittedly
imagine having to sit through KH2's prologue every time you wanted to do a run
KH2 I can skip cutscenes
@Ohrocks but you can't skip the tutorials
they gotta make sure you're alive still after skipping the cutscenes
uh... art is cool
we missed prologue Sadge
i got 3:07:58 with race rules
kinda surprised
i don't think we'll be seeing any more sub 3s with assumed fill
oh ya i meant with race rules
I almost forgot the good luck weed
with glitches and coincidences some pretty wild stuff could happen
now you wont get speedied
Look earlier I told monado that the freeform jazz would make early bobbery work and then it did so
@TacoGuyy "good luck weed" should I pop an edible, for luck?
Do it
Alright I'm gonna go do a windwaker run to yolo a pb before I say fuck this game again
Dog island as a grind game sounds painful with the rng
edible has been popped
you have to PB now
it's the rule
Alright gl on the rest time to remind myself why I'm dropping a game quick
believe in the weed
@TacoGuyy later mate
also yes
someone @ me in 10 minutes for another gl w speedy
turtle soup
damn you, badge man
hello there phantom :F
saw your last run rip bowser fight
ill get behind cursed cart
I'm saving up so i can make you a rando seed :D
i'm on a good way 4.3k
do you want to know the number tho?
it's not been that bad phantom
i dont know if I've ever seen you actually get 1st try speedy
i did not know the record any% of this game is 1h 41m 02s
yeah its morph
wiiu is a 1:41:07
cool rigby is on the list
he is on 82
it looks like a fun route
huh i wonder what happened that cost you 35 seconds in this run
i guess we'll never know
well good luck i'm heading out it's 4 in the morning for me so time for bed :D
quite a controller scheme
oh that is dope
thanks phantom have fun with the run
i used to do that playing casually on wii
i was a spin masher even when i was bad
gosh i sure have
really arent selling running this in anything other than rando
you know what's funny though
it's only the good runs lmao
everything usually is fine if I'm playing like shit
i haven't had everything line up for a while
oh dear
do you have the fight memorized?
welcome to my 3:43:55
it was my biggest mistake in that run
other than getting double dink
honestly, thinking of it that way, 51 second diff
20 of it was boo portrait 20 was double dink
my current pb is barely better than my old one
im a nobody now
i lost jcog vip F
run is looking pretty good so far
how the fuck did i mess up that bad
go fast
going fast PridePog
nm, how are you?
good ol' gambling speedrun Kappa
but Mario always wins. That has to count for something
wow no tailers
shockingly it landed heads
ez moneys
though I did bet so I can't end the prediction
welp time to wait a day
there is more than one of us
gl gl
gl gl
had a good any% run
awesome speedrun
yo raids
hi taco
That game is dead to me
whats good taco
Procced phantom ganon in ff2 so couldn't door clip and just decided I don't really care that much to keep going
No I didn't even get there lol
Triggered the miniboss so I couldn't go up there without being stopped
And can't kill him because no master sword
You get master sword from ganondorf cutscene
He gives you the weapon to kill him :)
I should make a layout for pape rando and fuck around with that tbh
For when I'm learning ori to still do something
Rando has been fun and I can LZS so it wouldn't be glitchless
that bee makes weed mario sad
I made a weedmario command in my chat and named it mxfour since they made my name theirs
what won
heads or ass
this is hands down my favorite ascii art
I sent you what it actually looks like
yo glgl
hi lips
you were akari
you should mash a+b as the battle fades out after your hurricane, it ends the battle faster
it applies to any fight where you gain 0 xp
weird game
weren't we wondering if it just applied to every fight period for a while
yeah we were but I feel like it's only true for 0 XP fights
could be wrong tho
EZ Clap
I do better when I'm looking at my controller vs looking at screen
for do a regular speedrun can I redeem hammer% KEKW
i wanna see you suffer though
Actually I don't want that lemme refund myself LOL
he IS doing a regular speedrun smh
that one marathon you did months ago did
I dont wanna see anyone do 3D world any% doesnt look interresting
And you told them No :)
3d world any% is only cool to me with the movement jank but like nobody does it because it's brutally hard to keep consistent with getting stars
Just get a perfect bowser
Do what jcog did that other night ezpz
well then do the equivalent
taco, check #general
mario to min min LUL
once we get sora I can finally stop monkaS
I think it's best to not get the sora one
don' acknowledge his existence
I was so relived once I got bayo "its finally over" Then Ulitimate got teased. "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!"
just nut on bowser again
I don't like the frame of him looking left
I dont wanna post that one anymore
mario threw a tantrum
he wanted to kill that koopa
Bowser pls phanto274Bless
monkaS someone pls
i dunno anything
bowser give peril phanto274Bless
yoo GG
Pb is a PB congrats!
random! peepoWave
Jen! peepoWave
lets go rng
top 20 BLANKIES
There's Mitzi, Gengar, Rigby
Did you get speedied this run
stop doing that
good luck on runs
me and Taco just find out that Ultimate Doubles is a side-event at CB
Team with proc coward
go 0-2 with the monkey
Yea it's a matter of if you like have a friend you wanna team with or just a static
I'm sorry for that showing at PP
That's the teams I play against around here I can fuck those up
I also play wario so that helps lol
no dink pls
we'll see when speedy is first
they lost a lifeshroom to an encounter and didnt want to try LP
we go AGAIN
glgl peepoComfy
you got it this time MarioDab
but... we love prologue Kappa
Played superhot for a bit
Bumped into my closet several times and now I'm very tired
but vr works so that's cool
Esam is remaking his discord rn
And he's trying to justify his mistake
that's 6.8 seconds too many time to reset
glgl Prayge
yeah this run looks really hot
in defricken green
don't ban me taco
i just assume hes here and waiting to ban me
was playing unite with people
game is still bad but last patch actually made it much better
score shield and buddy barrier both got TURBO nerfed
so its a much more engage-heavy meta
still some broken shit
and the game itself is like... built by toddlers
but its fun
Almost as hot as goompa
lol gless suffering
ah it makes sense, you want a good time, not to *have* a good time
im jk gless is fun
i mean that's pape for you. both this and ttyd
gless is jsut ch2 and 3 suffering in ttyd yeah
yeah its like 2+ hours in
after ch3 gless is basically just purely execution
ch2 is fine except when punie jumps just dont work for no reason
my gless pb has a mere 30 minute major league
has a 26 minute wr
lol major league be like that sometimes
like 70% of major league is literally just learning alternate fights
yeah, it's a great route to finish a run
my pb is only 6:39 so it's not even good lol
yeah, that's why i had to stop running it. when even sway takes 6 hours it's just too much
the tricks in TTYD are ridiculous
AND its 60 fps
if i had unlimited time i'd rather run that than pape i think, but i don't
the biggest difference, by a gigantic margin, is b for text vs mashing
Doing a run today also :D
i enjoy speed swapping, but i could see why people wouldn't
that was fast
the biggest problem with speedswapping is having to explain it to literally every viewer
speedswapping with peach is just goofy lol *wigglewigglewiggle*
I ... hate spm. I don't enjoy that game at all.
Don't tell spm people, they will hurt me
the start of this game makes me sadge for speedrunners
im feel for you
origami king was a bad game, agreed
how did the koopa brother's get to the bowser castle and so fast down?
imagine a basically on-rails 20 minute prologue regardless of category
maybe they jumped?
and the sunshine runners thought their prologue was bad enough to romhack it
have you used that pipe in any rando?
i know there is a big difference, i'm just memeing
yeah, sms runners are insane
when do you think the next rando is?
But also sms runners are *insane* the top level play of that game is ridiculous
if i had points i could make you one :D
just wait for plando and that reward
As mean as m4 seed the other night that needed to get ultra hammer, to get ultra boots, to get kooper in toy box, to get diamond stone in volcano, to beat ch2?
hmm maybe i should do a rando, i could if i start right now
quadruple?? lmao
what do vip?
bye goombario you will not be missed
dang it
"sigh" fine but only that fight
what fight?
presumably works because jr will just slap you over and over until you do enough damage
yay for not dinking
they work for bowser and are also scared of him hehe
whoever figured out to put fright jars in this game and ttyd is an asshole btw
they're more polarized. more 90+ and more < 5s too
yeah, that one is a thing
the worst fight in glitz is shy guys. cuz with 4 enemies, anything under 95% is gonna miss a lot. and those dudes steal items
i will be back later good luck with the run
poor bombette getting slapped
yoo gl
3rd try incoming
have you just had this 2nd cart lying around lmao
i should check around me to see if there's any local stores like that now that i'm not a bum
probably yeah
not spoodlied
so excited you did lil jumps of joy for the seed
you go REAL slow with js lol
the ! shows up, you pause a full 4 seconds
i've definitely triple jumped at locks in hooktails castle before
don't forget jumping on the furniture
it's very nice indeed
got nothing to do so here i am
and i do love paper mario so
think you forgot to jump :D
jumping in front of chests now too, really spicing it up
hammer time
well so far your doing good :D
wish i was good at speedrunning
i feel like the japanse version has lower health on the bosses
dew it :3
oh no it's bowow
when i was a kid i did not like this chapter
was to scary :3
did not like the ghosted
i can finally do equip swap in mm now, getting closer to doing runs soon
fuck this boo
It's impossible to learn a second character when jesse refuses to play anything but my wario
i have to relearn snowhead tho cuz we skip fire arrow entirely now
And with the delay we have from distance I don't wanna fucking play wario
we also skip light arrow but we get it through gim in great bay which is cool
so you never go into regular stone tower
also hi taco
wifi sucks
Like the 2nd wario set there were so many times where i was right but it had to be tight movement because of my char
And then I see the ad startup or roll and I just die at 90 because the DI is for the roll
Hi morph
What if it's just some hot hoes likin what they see
Yea they're wet for good PB's
@TacoGuyy he can't escape your Wario at the AirBnB
yo glgl
yo glgl
was good, brushed up on a few things
@buff00n I literally just want to play a secondary I want to have extra chars for a couple matchups I loathe but kinda can't learn them if he won't play them with things that aren't his shitty ass wifi chars
i know it all too well Sadge
Like I don't give a fuck about the PT sora matchup on wifi that char is fake
gonna get some food and lurk, glgl man Prayge
Also literally the only reason I stopped playing pit
He refuses to ever play it with anything
So I just can't play pit against good players
Like the chars I'm trying to play are all good chars that I play offline
wonder what the bed smell's like?
dreams and tubba sweat
broken dreams
He uses old spice deodorant and he thinks that's all he needs so he doesn't shower
Hence why there's no bathroom in the mansion
and where can you get a talking key i want one
Yea mario is too busy doing this shit
So the toads shit in the bushes
why do you think that green one refuses to cooperate
He's mad at mario
I assume you got speedied
well well well :D
oh rip
let's hope you don't die then
if it's okay ask how do i become moderator?
okay :D
Buff00n's a bastard
I will join that club in october or whenever the fuck port is
Uhhh let's check the modview tab
Roguedarkjedi and aladd
Idk who they are but they're mods
And phantomgamesbot, the best mod
When will phantomgamesbot be allowed to violence post publicly
Let's feed him good
Let him weed mario
This is injustice
that's dope
Ok brb I'm being dragged to a dinner when I already ate
you will like when you move out i lived alone since i was 18 now i'm 22
i went out of state so i will be in debt forever
no encounter so we good
yeah it's really comfy
as long as you dont jump in front of the chests like 4 times it's good
ah yeah true
the timing without the trage is really weird, m4, morph, and myself were doing right side door since that's usually fine in hurricane but in spook it's really awkward and you get encountered sometimes
yeah pretty much
YEP YEP
YEP YEP YEP
YEP YEP
Lantern ghost FrogeRiot
being real on twitch is cool
are you gonna be doing risky final from now on?
yeah fair
it's a duskull though, better send it back
but that's not a Dusclops next to me, and he's good until he gets knocked off
Dusknoir makes me so sad
yeah, it's got some good looks and it's decent as a tank/spin blocker. But like you said, clops is just better
"I guess I'll shadow sneak"
does it have pursuit?
Marowak-A is scary af in trick room
is it not available now in DP due to the Home update? I haven't kept up
didn't even get BDSP
well, ORAS added the primal reversion mechanic, wheras BDSP didn't really add any new mechanics, did it?
heard you like Houndour!
I was thinking Simisear, but that was BW
yeah, they're meant to be early game bridges to help you clear the early gyms
if you chose your starter poorly
beeg circle
800mg of copium
strimmer with the false advertising. Was promised top 15
time to git gud then
phanto274Sip COPIUM
uncapped too EZ
early cycle is like 16s
the spam A quiz?
Hows the run lookin
Just be fast
we love jank
just don't get stung EZ
what's good?
today is one of those BEST DAYS EVER
so after 2 weeks the 230 everdrive didn't ship so I canceler
found a listing on ebay for 250 I was sitting on
woke up from nap and he dropped it to 170
and it has already shipped!
it's an X5
don't forget
ebay chargers 10% too
so if I got it for 100 he's only making 50 bucks
I have no interest in GBA since I just emu everything
but I get it
I only stream bizhawk in obs
could ask bn guys, Kirby could prob help
gl on rest of run; time for din din
Just won a 500 ping strive game ama
GL ANYWAY PHANTOM, GEEZ
No otherwise I wouldn't have won
It was baiken so they also couldn't do shit LOL
think i will head out gl Phantom you got this
lunch is over so gotta run. I'd like to do a glitchless rando
hard part is over jcogDab
GL my guy
hiiii I haven't watched a run of this game since at least 5 years idk wtf is happening lol
I never seen that attack tbh lolo
that tells you how outdated my knowledge on that run is
same deal with watching bug fables, the key item get is my general notif tone on pc so it gets me everytime
text tone is medal get from bug fables
so you'll run bn5 to get more rng until you get back to pm64 :)
can you
go fast
so dont do that
+28 parakarry HmmCouncil
huh i wonder what happened
my downright is suddenly so far down that I can't do early whale anymore
i found out by holding up of down right and still ending up in bounds in a run like 4 times in a row
i was -1:04 and lost 3 minutes so i just called it
i need to drop ruins jump but I'm too stubborn
help lmfao
my values arent very good for it anymore with my stick
well i figured it out
i used to be able to do it 30x in a row but i cant anymore lmao
hope it doesn't change again by tomorrow
being conservative with assuming i lose some time but not a fuckton to the rest of my splits i could've 3:10ed that run
eugh lmao
nvm it still only loses 3s to fail and use para vs not going for it
i hate this game lmao
i would still not do it unless my success rate was like 90% tbh
my mentality has changed a lot
i used to never miss this shit but my controller now is bad for it
so I'm half considering dropping it
oh i should see if my controller can do it with these diagonals
it's actually extra bad
got home early from work. GL GL phanto274Smile
yo mitzi
6:23 is hype
double mood
you look like a glitch guy
what are you doin'
welp i just got ruins jump 10x in a row remapping neutral
guess I'm doing that now Sadge
it doesnt even save 2 seconds OMEGALUL
such a silly trick
i feel like if you have to remap neutral for a trick
it probably doesn't belong in gless lmfao
this specific thing is fine imo but that just sounds so sketch
you shouldnt have to, my controller is just bad
one advantage of oem
my theory is that having higher range makes the jump easier
you will never remap neutral on accident
ive done that before trying to rebadge out of a spin
i think with my current stick it's frame perfect but it'd definitely not frame perfect if i remap
while gripping my controller
im fairly certain gc has really high range
so does hori but my hori's angles are super horrible for ruins jump i havent even come close with hori
i just realized that my struggling with bts recently is probably the same angle shift that fucked my whale
i should've known this was gonna happen
what are your cardinals
press start
press start again
and then do the test
that's fairly standard tbh
there's a newer version of the rom
that shows diagonals and has other benchmarks and stuff
up and down are a little off center but otherwise solid
a brand new oem typically has 85s for cardinals
anything 80+ is considered pretty good
all of my cardinals are 80+ except for left, which is 75
so that means my upleft and downleft are more up/down than left
gameplay is improving, ggs
yo glgl
get away phantom while you still can
pape is not worth it
gotta dip for now but hope your fright jars are scary and your spins are speedy Prayge
TIFF MADE THE PERFECT Pepega SHAPE ON ACCIDENT
IT'S SO GOOD
I'll send it on disc with the emote it's so perfect
Also gl
Just don't get speedied and kill everyone perfectly
I love the song that repeats itself every 15 seconds!!!!
Yo turn it up this shit goes hard
fuck it's over
Mario Slander is Cringe He's just as awesome as all the other Super Mario Characters, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'basic'. FREAKING LOVE MARIO!1!1!>:(
should've made it Wario to prevent the ban
Wario Slander is Cringe He's way more awesome than all the other Nintendo, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'hot as fuck'. FREAKING LOVE WARIO!1!1!>:(
I hope 'hot as fuck' gets used by your bot soon
Goomnut on these bitches
what'd arie do
I should probably setup the new monitor so I can see the m4 chat
Chat loaded and I just see "c o r r u p t i o n"
How hard is the 2nd part
I know the first is fp
Very cool
heyo glgl
gl gl
Thanks! SO CLOSE bepisCry
just makes me want it that much more
that's like ONE encounter I cry
first run of the night? :D
I wish there was some pape in the sgdq lineup
Pape so comfy. Would be great for gdq
stop and swap is different
what is stop and swap?
Imagine how much better the world would be if those bills were just all at once on a pattern
I will EAT a Fright Jar if this run PBs. I will crack the lid with my teeth and suck out all of that sweet fright juice. Then, I'll insert the jar in my mouth and begin crunching. Once it has been reduced to several sharp chunks, I will unleash it into my unsuspecting stomach. After that, it's up to my doctor. That is how confident I am that this run is dead.
this song goes so hard
hggGun ok
tf: give him speedy
youtube viewers modCheck
they'd have my back
I'm down
I like glitches
Bro there's nothing attached just do the funny jumps
we do a lil pondering
Count the frames lazy ass
you got speedied with speedy in hand
glitched rando is cool, even if i can really only do LP skip, some laki clips, and maybe bhs
so cute
THEIR NOSES ARE SO BUG
I WANNA BOOP EM
definitely a big head code
AND THERES BIRDS
my ovaries oh my lord what is this masterpiece
AS YOU SHOULD
oh my

WHAT AN OLD MAN DOG
these game devs knew what was up. Dog content is the best bepisLoveCat
absolute downgrade
we need to go back
absolutely adorable
milk man looks like... he would sell you Adderall
for sure
doggy Adderall
this game deserves an award
speedrun requires you to be nekkid?
gotta feel the breeze
man so I guess theres no public indecency laws on dog island
dog village
dog world
the way your doggo runs
oh no the sad doggo music
wow what a sham of a dog doc
we do all of this for our bro?
the deck looks clean already tho
D: i guess I'm blind
DOGGO GOES FISHING?
straight bangers this game has
I would reset this game just cause i could
listen to that intro again
Which of these fuckers is making the deck dirty
fuck the mailman

@buff00n Buff00n needs an ego boost before I shit on him at combo breaker
TacoGuyy refuses to let me know peace
Simply don't lose
Also I have 66.9k channel points rn
@buff00n tbh, we're prolly gonna do drunk Ganon dittos
Why is it in Japanese? I'm surprised the words ain't in English
You can probably put it to English in settings I think???
I grew up playing this game I chose a golden retriever
Oh that's awesome!
To match amalia?
As I understand it if your a female the victory gang is your romantic interests but if your male amalia is one but who else
I did all the quests lol also poor Peter he's in love with amalia
Er princely paws I guess lol
I did know
Who's it supposed to go to though?
I wonder if your female if Alex can be a love interest
He was my favorite because when I was a kid I loved his riddles
Camu is one so is McCoy I don't know if there's a third
Are u playing wii now?
Hell yes I agree
Imagine if they included the actual animal of the crab and it could pinch your pups nose
I find it a shame that not a lot of people play this anymore it was a really adorable and fun game
I never liked Petz 2 or 1 for that matter
I preferred the dog island
Do you wanna hear something funny
The night before I got this game I dreamed of cute dogs and running around through a meadow the next day dad gave me a random wii game and this was it
I was like 11 I'm 23 now and I still love this game
How many speed runs are there for this game?
A shame honestly..
Scooby doo cyber chase was a fun game
Cyber chase was my first game on ps2 I ever played scooby doo was a fun game
Cute giraffe :3
They really had fun working on the cute aspect of this game huh?
I got distracted, where in the story are we?
Got it
Another ps 2 game I loved was 102 Dalmatians
It's old really old lol
Strong puppy ^^

Cronos won anyway because nikita

the flowers were so nice
I miss Boris every day
YO THERE'S A FLOWER
I love emotes like this because it puts mobile viewers through hell
Chikorita I like this emote
This emote is based

Chikorita gg
Oh I was literally typing for you to raid sway LOL
I was not expecting to enjoy this game as much as I did
I have that on the other tab
This game is lit
thank you for showing me this
Where's the milk he went to get
Fuck this guy
the whining noise is killing me
Whine ... aww
oh its a glitched rando today?
ah fair, glgl anyway
but.. why, discord people? i can only do a few that matter and it's still neat to do/try

Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on viewers. shop (viewers. shop)!

Ive clicked one of their links before back when they still did links. Websites are ugly as hell haha. They really care about their scams LUL
I hate mario
I love baking cake

I love this part
I think about dog island sometimes btw thank you for introducing me to that game

my schedule is poopy now
I heard you had a glitch that has only ever happened one other time? UNLUCKY

Charizard is so fucking fun
I gotta show you what I hit jaemi with later LOL
BombWave yo

Don't forget the star piece in the flowers
are you excited for Summer games fest
I don't mean gdq
it's basically E3
all the companies are going to big there even Microsoft and Sony but not Nintendo
Did you go back and get the star piece in the flowers?
What do you think of Coney's current stream title
it's very good
That's how weed mario was born
"Sorry dear, I just rolled THE WORST blunt."
At least you're not in peril currently
Wow this is a LONG long speedrun
Nice job again on GDQ yesterday btw!
I was thinking about doing it sometime later this week
Will they post your run btw or should we like archive it?
Ok cool
i didnt get past speedy
i only did 3 attempts tho
yeah i saw that lmao
i've been watching while i was in prologue
is this glundo?
who redeemed this!?
also whats good
i got a 1 minute gold on knightman today, crazy how easy it is to save time when you derust
to get familiar again
dalus and I are doing commentary on komari's run
they asked me to do it, was glad to have carpal tunnel excuse ready. Dont wanna get on a stage like that
finding energy to stream has been hard for me recently
I just feel tired all the time
like I was off yesterday and still didnt go live
FUCK GOOMBA ROAD
consistent is my favorite word
my expansion pak has shipped so ill be able to practice soon
also send me a seed for what you think my first rando should be
its gonna be a train wreck, havent really played beyond chapter 5 LMAO
cant be worse than laichan phanto274Shrug
poor girl, she has been live for 1 and a half hours and only has boo portrait, and 2 seeds
you hate to see it
all badges, star pieces, and.... tattles KEKW
oh receipies
submit this for really really long a thon
I came up with some new BN23 head canon today
Arashi's mission to gas Yai was to get funds so they could hire Dusk to attack yumland and electopia :mindblown:
what do you do before chapter 8?
basically everything?
[all the side quests]
do you max partners too?
bowser cheats
he gets a buff and attacks on the same turn
he uses the star rod to make mario skip a turn OMEGALUL
fun stuff?
do you save all of quizmo for now or do you do some on the way?
whats in goomba village
I was about to meme about all the mushroom in the inn, then I realized this is vanilla OMEGALUL
imagine knowing this game well enough to run glundo in jpn
Coney is watching strikers gameplay and it looks very... dull
It looks very slow
GL, gonna go say hi to others running pape tonight
And all your attacks having big arrows showing you charge them and you have a dodge button
gotta support this community
Coney is very sad
They at least have good goal celebration animations
yeah, new strikers doesn't interest me
and that's before the lack of Daisy
2 yeah
couldve been worse COPIUM
I hate Rune Factory 5
He can't milf hunt
WHY DOES THIS GAME PRESENT ME WITH LADIES THAT ARE 100% MY TYPE, THEN TELL ME I CAN'T BLOODY HAVE THEM
He wants to wreck homes
THIS SUCKS
I'd rather hear playground
jenysrMips Jeny raid jenysrMips
jenysrMips GL
oh no he says KEKW
jenysrMips Gl phantom!!
I have to do some things so I will be back in a few!!
did you hand in the mailbag? thats my guess LUL
ask merluvlee FeelsOkayMan
is this a chat assisted speedrun jcogLUL
just don't call it a TAS bc then you're calling us all tools NiceSoftlock
ive been called worse
oh no
glitchless 100.99% category when?
Improvement is improvement. We take what we can get
Is this route new?
Oh cool!
How does safe ending differ from the risky one? I have yet to look at the routes
Hmm I see
Hai hai. :D
Don't sound so enthused to see me, gosh.
I'm diving into glitchless today actually. Making some notes for myself on the route then practicing some specific chapters. Should be a couple days until I run it
Nope but I am all ears
Yeah I'm doing safe route
Power bouncing huff. Yeah I think chapter 6 in general is gonna be one of those I need to practice. Same with 7
You say that but yo those mirrors and knowing where to go mess me up lol
Honestly everything is on the practice list lmao
Oh yeah chapter 4 might be tough too for me. Lol it's just a lot but I'm excited to learn
Oh absolutely
Uh yes. I want to
Not sure if I can't
Oh cool! I be sure to look for that when I get there
madman really out here doing mega bomb
Rigby235: m
pb with mega bomb PAUSERS
mx_four: Rigby235:
yo Ryan
hellowo fowevew
and ghl
that was a typo, but let's say it stands for good heckin' luck
I'll miss my #freecannonless movement but I'm super happy with this rando update
Good heckin luck
same. that was my big issue too
What is this chapter eight that you speak of?
trick question. speedrunners don't know what chapter 8 is
also hi Ryan
Have you ever done any Thousand Year Door stuff?
What about any%? Ever thought about learning glitches for said game?
Arent the tricks like crazy hard in TTYD
I wanna see a phantom palace skip
yeah exactly. 60 fps frame perfect monkaS
What about the abomination that is Origami King? LuL
Mario out here using the Kirby hammer for a moment.
it took me an embarrassingly long time what you meant by laki fight. was trying to figure out which fight we use laki for
forgot we actually fight the dude
in a rando streamer now and we don't fight laki idk
You don't want to have to run some Refund backup strats? :D
quit dreamin pal
this is why i don't run anymore
i got too many tastes of the doogan dong and i didn't like it
doogan dong
hm odd
So, please explain the "MegaBomb%" bit to me.
The madlad.
That's... certainly a strategy.
Sounds time consuming, yeah.
Mistakes? Mn... Steaks. I miss steaks.
rowf is an air raid fan
my pb is 6 you can do it
go phantom go!
6th try
he's doing it!!!
New WR incoming.
so close
Mission failed successfully.
7???? holy crap
Sometimes, video games just say no.
now I have nothing Sadge
my pb is also 6th i think
m4 is 6 as well iirc
6 6 6 monkaS
do it with your highlight attached lmfao
yeah i agree
I love that attitude.
if i get worse than first try i want it to be really bad
in the last 56 runs i've only gotten worse than 2nd try once and it was 3rd
i think total 1st try is still just over 75% for me
which i'll take lmao
oh yeah i guess overall i have no clue what my rng is
i could maybe find out if i looked at my split files but idc about my old ones as much
yo glgl
yeah like before i started my grind i could still pb with either a fail or second try or both bc that happened once at 3:44 lmfao
not that i cant now but like eh
Doing a run i see :D
something happend i'm guessing?
0.000244140625 is 0.25^6
then * .75 would be 7th try right
well if you fail agian do rando :3
like in rando you can't fail :)
why do we need all the peach segments
and get that gomba away
imagine playing glitchless at all tbh
he got you there hehe
new category extension?
just woke up from a late nap
maybe can stream later
its storming pretty hard here
Hikari doesnt like storms
sometimes shell come in here and shake at my feet
best song
The castle theme is so nice
Oh no. I stepped away for a few minutes, and we've reset again. D:
What happened this time?
Ah, okay.
you excited about it?
finally someone with an honest opinion
looks like every other arena fighter and throw in every direction
hey look we are back where i joined hehe
we went back in time
oh shit, komaris is starting soon
same they have to use buster up
ive seen someone do it
maybe method?
thats how long its been LUL
bn2 buster only is the dumbest thing ever
remember before shadowman?
you can hit him with buster but frame perfect, so its 12 frame perfect charge shots before style change
then you need heat style for null and void in undernet
bn3 you need heat style for bass aura
in bn33 id run kawarimi on navicust
bn3, you know
hides behind a rock
phantom, did you know im a mitzi bro for life
mitzi bro
I need a bro emote now LUL
Just for axl
there are so many "If this happens do this" in the route
oof, sounds like komari is peaking
Yeah just trying to make the notes not hurt my brain as much
speednotes live
speed GUIDES live ok
ill look into ti
wait phantom, dont they have to do falzar?
how would you clear matches classes?
you cant reach the back
or I mean you cant do fire dmg
I didnt know such a thing as speedguides existed phanto274Hype ty ty I shall use it
i wonder if gregar is even possible
getting heat cross sounds like the killer
this morning I got home at 6:30... damn i missed the end of mitzi's run KEKW
imagine getting reflectr from robodog comp LUL
its easier since it only has mettaur encounters
but very slow
yoo congrats
congrats!! welcome to the cool kids club
Yaaaas ty ty <3
I can officially move on to glitchless for a while
cursed cartridge
send axl old cart?
like the name :D
perfect LUL
phantom is too good for us!!!!
is this update live?
letters sounds gross
i mean yea idek those rewards never did that shit lol
yeah id take default out of the rotation
so each FP move cost -2?
mario went boom
nice glitch bruh
fun where i live it's raning :D
ToyBox Hype!
fire kammy LUL
crystal ball?
what does that give you in vanilla?
hehe rigby is playing paper mario to :D
go fast
i'm here all the way Phantom
icebox buster only
i'm happy i found you here on twitch :D
this this the glundo? Kappa
waiting on the run back
hehe blue watt
1FP but flower saver so how does that work?
so i tried killing fuzzypede without watt by ending with volt shroom. but in the dark fuzzy just heals himself F
i just did it to see if the next cutscene would have a different partner text box
she is sick
curious to try auto kill and practice rom to see what happens
chapter 5 music is the best :D
yo? my game shop got Intellivision II system and loads of CIB games
i have no way to connect it tho
thats 2nd gen right?
FOR GAME PRESERVATION!!
boxed copy of he-man omg
diveman oof
sub 1:45
nah, just the kids
all this talk about buster only
but what about hamme ronly Kappa
i wish that dried shroom was a trap OMEGALUL
whats the badge?
i never noticed marios face on it lol
nice check there buddy
i be gone maybe 15 min gl
did they really take an ad break during the middle of the run?
they stopped komaris run to run run some ads
umm ... no
cream party?
i say chapter 2
you waiting on weight for chapter 3?
btw I order my ps5 panels
the went for preorder this week
have the purple controller so want it to match
buy weed everyday phanto274Jam
i tired the expansion pak again today and no luck
tried 2 differrent jumper paks and it booted fine
mark said he has an extra and will hook me up
why is the weight lower on the list?
then why is goombario at the very top Kappa
i had no idea what that was, "is that a tumor???"
how is the run going?
why cant you sell?
makes sense, he needs to store those items somewhere OMEGALULA
missed the caplock at the end there LUL
that looks so much easier
mitzi take notes
as long
someone scalping star pieces
oh no he is dead
i love you dont have laki yet
it's very sad that we don't have laki :c
lakileister? more like lack luster Kappa
laki where are you :c
5 years later
grabbed a drink, what was in the chest?
a bomb
wish it was a laki trap just to spite you KEKW
Maybe with that attitude it's too much
hey dawg those text boxes aren't randomized, I was promised everything being random
twitch just gave me an ad on the main page for condoms
dont they know that this page is for gamers?
Runs didn't go well, I take it?
wow, ghost goomba.
is it the one that has a call of duty-type loadout screen?
shocked that star piece stayed the same
know your demographic twitch!
I'm okay with more randos.
you can explore chapter 6 right
ive never properly played oot on n64 so will be starting that off stream soon
need to find a good button layout
how do wii do it?
just add a mic attachment and hum the songs
that sounds clean
oh boy playing songs that were meant to use a d pad on a joystick aint fun try playing pac man with a regular non arcade joystick
sub 2 at elementman
the colored plants are cannibals... huh.
I've been playing the original Zelda with my daughter on Switch with a pro controller and it's so difficult because of the D-pad. I tried the stick but noped out of that real quick
thats the run GG
are those phantom coins?
if we get goombario in the place of mega rush that will be so disappointing
ooh chapter 3 opening up
is therre a story behind the name phantom?
wanna know pain? try playing sm64 without a z button and doing bomb clip as the FIRST STAR OF THE CHALLENGE
laki can go over lava but not water
when did you get weight?
That letter was a bomb. That's messed up.
I just looked down and thought "whats the green ultra stone" LUL
dont remember if I asked you or if it was someone else.,.,.
is yoshi cookie made from yoshi?
HE KNOWS THE LORE
you should know koopa fortress would have traps
nice they dont have the "partner joiined your party"
its the real one this time KEKW
i missed it but komari did indeed show off the parasol cutscene
in sky town
spider is still the best
oh wait i forgot
MEGAMAN ATTACK!!!
yeah, bn3 has the best one lol
rip harry's shop
oh! thats how you do colonel quick kill
it prevents him from summoning the soldier
you have to hit him before he moves again but he has i frames so its tight
so hit him twice on the same panel
did you upgrade hammer?
this is chap 7 tutenkoopa aint it
it DID in fact do damage even if its 1
clean fight
Cheer100 Cheer100 GET FUCKED NERD
get rainbows nerd OMEGALUL
i need to give 600, not in any rush
is there any reason to pick power bomb over mega bomb?
does mega do more dmg?
yo!! gavel skip
going into judgemanEX with 1 HP
the book got im LUL
yeah, i have no idea how the book works
gavel got him KEKW
book in his front row
he's choking on gavel now
3 times in a row failed
its bad unless you are risch
they have those same hit boxes in mother comp too
when you do the passwords
oh no
he's doing judge with beastout
thats so cringe
oh damn i missed his beast fight
I see a really big problem here.
You have Goombario.
thats a blessing
That's not a Watt, this is a Watt.
And all this to go save the Princess? I dunno... Effort vs Reward...
I'm not huge on this Bow color.
your going strong i see
green tubba :D he is also sick
question about your audio
your mic doesnt pick up your game audio since you dont have headphones?
im sure I dont need mine but I love my headphones
have audio technia m40x
now for mario to smell the bed
oh letter insanity is new?
wait why do you have goombario with you?
???? What's that teal Ultra Stone???
oh, yeah
I forgot
I mean, it IS the same sprite as the Ultra Stone tho
so I'm not TECHNICALLY wrong
that was easy
weird, but not unwelcome
kinda miss the lightning, ngl
EXCUSE ME
THAT'S OD
why would you ever not just nuke everything
what do you missing?
oh no
does the chest do anything in rando?
YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER *misses*
Master does better when he stops talking shit
this seed's pain
50 years later
this is kinda like 100% run hehe
this seed is evil
we in go mode?
its been 5 hours my guy!
your on the final goal now :D
sub 6 lets go!!
but 1FP bomb is worth it
have a wild clip to share
yo glhf
i got to final but my lategame was shit
lost a min to final anyway lmao
holy shit lmao
holy shit
does the new setting let Mario do the smart thing and fly straight to Bowser
wasn't wrong then
I WAS KIDDING
once we get the konami collection
what do you mean?
thats all konami does now
a konami collection that isn't bugged to Hell n' back
I just made myself worried about that TMNT collection
the cowabunga collection
cuz I'll grab that if it's a functional experience
im not worried, its by digital eclipse the same guys the did megaman legacy collec ... nevermind
but phantom it has power fighters ... POWER FIGHTERS!!!
is it possible to just power thru and win on phase 1?
i hate stuff like that, bn3 has the bass fight you cant win
btw, how is routing going?
my seed hurt me. did yours hurt you?
nope not at all
how much of Koopa koot did you do?
chased a moth out of my room lol
is this what they call "god tier rng"?
HI YOUTUBE
why do you do this to yourself
you skip checks,
then it bites you
mine ane m4s seed had....
anti guy had ice palace key. seed behind 4th ruins key, which we got from a letter which was found in palace. Goomba king had tubba key. master 1 had star stone. Koopa koote 18th request had tubba key. so lantern ghost had luigis autograph
Do it again in under 4 hours and 40 minutes
What do you mean unlucky
You have goombario
when is quizsanity
Make it a 100k point reward
Nobody WANTS to play it
It's just really funny
Like sploosh kaboom + auction rando for WW
If m4 isn't you can raid sway
Sway just started
on alt
I like that your tracker shows spirit order now
Old ass
"This was a seed" Drake
Is it me or did you shave?
hello friendo
rando bullied me
time for me to make another Megamind meme
couldnt figure out how to clear a single chapter
not having bomb, para, or bow walled me out of chapter 2 3 and 4
may god rest your soul, you are going to play park dear god
selling ultra jelly was hype
I made meme and put in #memes
If you get speedy you get the other half of weed mario
You have to earn it
too bad he gets it anyways
Streaming multiversus would just be free stream content but like
I just don't want to play it lol
just play Jake Jake
*Jake, Jake
multiversus is not fun to watch lol
Like I got top 100 and top 5 with my char I really don't care lol
My classic play of getting high enough rank to say a game sucks
Jake called Finn Jake and he said that's his name now, so I told him that'll be his name as well
yo glgl
beating glenn on the leaderboard should be easy lol
I really hope it gets better cause the ideas are there
It's just not fun yet for me
Yea I was top 60 before I stopped
Singles I refused to touch lol
No good players are being voted in to the gimvitational so far lol
Crowned should be supported not this bullshit lol
We need to get crowned to actually break even they lost fucking 10k from sponsors because gimr had to flex his microdick
Also who wants to fucking campaign 50k to go to a hazards tourney at a horse track
The only other thing is coneys house but you can't go there unless you spend 99million channel points
Yea combo breaker is gonna have a billion things at the venue and I also know that area and there's a lotta good food and shit
Didn't port get shit on by a SWT event last year
Sounds about right
Now that they're done gimr said hold my beer
And gives 0 shits now
And people wonder why Ceo, ricks events, and anything bts wouldn't opt in to swt
Gimrs current event structure just shits out events with no prize pool just to get viewership
And every event i hear the same exact issues with everything in the venue lol
Well bighouse fucked theirs anyway
shit I didn't get to vote
I mean did gamble
I'm tired
splatoon is a joke too! grand prize is a jacket, a switch case, no prize money? get the fuck out!
oh they get 10K platinum points cant forget that one!
That might be why the panda circuit is taking a while they might be fixing that fingers crossed
Where gimr has enough setups to run bracket and then takes everything down the split second top whatever starts
Yea top players live off content anyway, tourney money is just extra
Yea I literally am only going to double down because jesse
Their modded setups are ASS
Mods should stay out of bracket
Like if anyone ever wanted me to turn off my shit when I bring my switch for whatever I would just do it cause idc if I only have colors and a few songs it just makes sense
I mostly bring mine for training mod and friendlies
whats your take on slippy for events?
oh wow
Yea it was just a couple dudes making it in free time I don't imagine it'd be groundbreaking lol
Like they did a good job but it's not absurd
thats so funny
luigi skip frame by frame
whats the most recent release? I have fp-1.1.0
yeah he gave it to me, should still have the link
when I arrived to the fortress blue koopa bro came out "YO ITS LEONARDO!!!"
They should make npc model rando
time to scramble an egg into an omelette
just ordered pape jpn... and thats everything. Can finally stop spending money on this game LUL
people do that?
m4 is testing new controllers hopefully they stop getting fucked for random tricks they can't do
hammer cancel is s w a g though
im mean i dont plan on grinding or anything
thats very fair
i mean with having eng and jpn on ED thatll give me 4 copies for saves lol
Top 4 of the local today was steve, cloud, steve, steve
get me out
Jaemi lost to only steve at advantage state and got 3rd
2 locals in a row had 3 steves in top 4
Actually what was the fuckin top 8 for fridays local I forgot about that one
Ok failbot didn't go yesterday so it was only TWO steves in top 4
The steve that's not mirai or failbot though sucks idk how he's getting top 4's
I've played him once and he just did layer 1 shit and I fucked him up lol
And he tried his pocket hero and proceeded to burn all his mana while I walked away
Heros other specials are really good
stage 2 side b is absurd
But yea minnesota has gone from the megaman state to the steve state
these fucks hate fun
I gotta send you a clip tho of something jaemi did to a steve on wednesday
Cause the ones that aren't failbot are genuinely mashers
Yeti got banned from AS because of a misunderstanding and they never reverted it after he privately cleared things up with the actual person involved
I think he's back in like a month or 2
he apologized and got banned still
He was friends with that person prior and after though they commentated together at the last 2 AS's he was at before being banned and I'm pretty sure that was after the thing happened lol
At least if it was who I think it was
Oh yea between the megaman era and the steve one there was also all the megamen playing minmin for a bit before she got nerfed
The minmins never won anything though because loaf existed
The one dlc pass2 matchup that's just really good for wario lol
get the maple in tubba's castle
Visitor just salt tweeted about steve and all the mn people are in the replies knowing it's a salt tweet/joke tweet and everyone from the other parts of twitter are MAD
Yay smash Twitter
Like visitor was megaman and minmin MN knows he's not allowed to tweet about characters
I follow the top players whose content I like and people in region
The rest of my twitter is art or fgc
speaking of fgc
Fgc is so much nicer to follow than smash it's crazy, like there's still shitheads but the overall group is so much better to look at
ya love to see it
buff00n I'm in a smash mood go set up your shit
There's a char I wanna fuck around with that jibca has inspired me to retry
I do not fathom the people play Miis in the Nintendo-3rd-party smorgasbord fighting platformer game
The rollback felt wack in doubles but in 1v1 it felt good
Did you plug a wire into your ps5 or were you still running wifi
I figured LOL
Like if you didn't plug it in for strive I doubted you would for multi
I've been playing unwired because I've been too lazy to make the hole mine is going through larger for 2 wires and it's felt more or less the same lol
When we got this current router tho I just stopped having packet loss issues at all on wifi on my pc
Ps4 tho I still had to wire because that shit sucks and mainly why I got pc strive LOL
Yea if the speeds are pretty much the same and you're not getting packet loss you really don't need to lol
A quarter of gigabit is still like 10x better than what most people are running LOL
Guess who is back to watch my favorite stremer :D
Fanart has sold me on Ingrids design for 3hopes
Although everyone draws the hair way nicer than it actually is lol
I've not played that game type since i played warriors 1 like a year and a half ago so I'm just in the mood for it
speedrun hyrule warriors when
witch one there is two
FE warriors was so close to being really good
the story is okay gameplay meh
If they just didn't 3ds post exclusively and didn't have clones I would like it so much more
I was mad that the fates chars were the ones with unique shit because I didn't want to play them
Falco doesn't deserve fun
you got the maple, right?
@TacoGuyy was eating
I'm ready
oh you never responded to it so I didn't setup lol
I haven't gotten my setup out since as gimme a sec lol
@buff00n lobby up
just be like morph he don't think
same that's why I can't sleep ever lol
do a glitch TF2John
that's not
the emote I wanted
why did it complete to that
what the fuck even is that emote
TF2John who is tf2 john
why is he
He is not safe hggMickey
wow buff00n was the first one ready but heavy day has already looped once
and he aint here
Least this song slaps
Ok back to goldlewis theme
modCheck still an empty lobby
how many guilty gear songs will I burn through before he shows up
None of these songs are short either lol
lobby is more dead than buff00ns punctuality
BITCH MAKE ME WRONG FOR ONCE PLEASE
was talking to my mum
get the game right dumbass
also lobby is back up
PROLOGGERS YO WHEN WAS THIS ADDED
oh yeah go fast
almost forgot
dont go fast
spite him
the moment I threw out that dtilt I said "ah, right. Super armor"
y'know I forgot about wing armor too
I just wanted to poke the floor
im imagining kolorado puking on the SSTuna
have you played harvest moon 64?
same here i loved it
i got it cheap at a movie rental
remember buying used games at movie rentals?
i forgot sushie is purple
new strats?
I was lurking in a stream with pape 64 HD textures, really dont like how it looks honestly. Feels like the personality of the partners are gone
wait on cardboard mario
paper mario X Labo
im not
nintnedo doesnt do things that make "too much sense"
a new glitch!?!?
its something that happens in this speedrun
ive seen that in speedruns
just not glitchless KEKW
i approve of using bombette more
you didnt even use bombette tho
oh? I didnt notice
mustve been out of it
I forgot it was yoshis I can't do that and live
"he's falling kinda fast- oh"
yea I inputted fastfall after the fair instead of before so it maintained the speed lol
but rando is fun :D
that i can see hehe
run rando and a different speed game LUL
do ttyd rando
if it existed then maybe
smrpg rando
WW rando is genuinely pretty fun every now and then
and it's like the most beginner friendly tricks
so is there only paper mario that has rando in the era?
i see
uh oh
i turned on turbo and dont know how to turn it off LMAO
fair enough
turbo socpens2FAST
ive never actually played it
despite having a snes mini
I do NOT understand the hype behind Geno
I had a snes growing up but it just had smw, all stars, and aladdin
even yoshis island?
aladdin fucking SLAPPED tho
CANnot fathom why people love Geno
jesse has bad taste
tbf, I like SMRPG for it's music, graphics humor
and nonsense
Me and my sibling found star world before we had access to the internet and our minds were fucking blown
SMB3 > SMW
stop spittin'
I grew up with both and I never liked 3
you're flooding my house
with facts
stop being unlucky
I had a sega, brother had a snes. But he lived with his grandmother [we had different dads] we hung out ever other weekend. Sometimes he would surprise me and bring his snes over. Then eventually he gave it to me. I still have it.
I dont wanna hear it
I had an atari 2600 until I got my sega OMEGALUL
irememberr the controller more than the games KEKW
Oh yea the other game my snes had was american ff3
Brother had a Genesis, Uncles had a Genesis and SNES
and that's the only ff game I ever played
so I had the best of both worlds
do you like them or hate them?
one thing I love about black pit is shortcuts when fightings, like C up is jump, c right is hammer ect.
I'm slowly learning that sephiroth can kinda do the things I want
He does what I wanted ike to do but then he can actually fucking move
i love seeing duck hunt
Raito is playing banjo now so we have 0 duck hunts
I missed seeing void wrecking shit with pichu
out of the gate that shit was hype
lightning loops LUL
I like watching dabuz if he's playing rosa
Puppet chars are always cool to me
it'd be really funny
i broke the practice rom lol
was on goomba road loaded a warp and i picked up the star rod then it crashed
i only tried to go to toad town
y'know I didn't like the situation I got put in for being right
I was correct on him swinging then my octoslash traded and got me kill combod offstage because he had less hitstun
shield breaker, baybeeeeeeee
feeling pretty tired so calling it here
uhhhhhhh can you skip this on JP?
Marth would've killed that
If you were marth I don't think I'd ever lose my wing before I cap out the damage
only one way to find out
that should've been tipper when you got that 2nd wing
there I could play the game since we weren't on lylat
This char not it on slants lol
go approximately 45.5 seconds faster
he bolted
not even tipper fsmash feels satisfying
this character SUCKS
I just broke buff00ns ankles
Shimmied the fuck out of a grab
gl with the run PogChamp
I only know the Green Meadows part of the run so seeing the other levels will be cool
PAPER POKEMON 64, WOWIE!!!! MY FAVORITE GAME!!!!
I'm shiny hunting Eevee in Arceus and I got a shiny Carnivine
Haunted and Granite zone are my personal favs
Gotta love motion controls
Better than the dog island sled racing tho
gtg but gl with the rest of the run!
nice obstacles
all friends Pog
wait idk you ran this!
yeah but steam deck and crippling warioware addiction so I didn't check twitch lol
I actually got my first 100 in a warioware set
was pretty pog
Hi Phantom and Chat! Saw your Dog Island run recently and had a lot of fun. :)
Yup, the GDQ one
I love Paper Mario. I don't know what Battle Network 6 looks like, I think I saw the beginning of 3 and I was mindblown by the manips ...
6 has no manips
I have no idea what those mean xD Guess I gotta wait till I catch you streaming it :P
Why'd you hit him
what you didn't have was mercy
Don't know about that either o: Sorry I still have a lot to learn haha
and she wanted to throw hands
I went positive on jaemi with my seph in friendlies today tho
I hit my footstool shit it's pretty simple on falco hitboxes because of the hitstop
But yea it's very satisfying to have falco dair my shield and I stop on him and impale him
is this pokemon the best one for this?
The minigame glenn has played for like 50 hours
clearly ... they used their own secret wood stash
item sliding oneeMonkas
Fridge when are we making a Bridge emote
oh shit there's a fridge on a bridge emote
you should make me a 7tv editor
I need to add gerberwott
0.49 seconds O_o
He's tied at worst on all of them I think
Me saying he played 50 hours was not exaggerated
He had way too much patience for it
He would just do 8 hour streams of that shit
That's some dedication xD
Speaking of dedication, imma go nap for a bit, how much longer do you stream for?
I'd play this map in hots
hey phantom I called mid rigby2NinOko
Lowkey this is the layout of cursed mines LOL
BloodTrail awesome, good luck with the rest of the run, though you'll gold every split it seems
The only thing mid is you
Ok I have to leave for the strive local in like 5 minutes so I should get ready
have fun making friends and murdering baby pokemon
I already know glalie fucks I'll survive
16 minute gold?
skill issue
this minigame was my GOAT when i played this game LUL
blaziken is def the worst
how do they keep track
for all we know we couldve been the 1026th visitor
ight well anyways imma lurk now, gl on the power of friendship
yay it's still going lol
that music reminded me a bit of mario, ngl
in casual, what else are berries for? you have way too many
Okay. I'ma need you to explain yourself on this one.
Nothing to say for youself? KEKWait
Did you ever play Hey You, Pikachu! on the N64?
I never had any issues with it.
I might go play some DBD for a bit, but, this is certainly something.
Good.. uh... luck?
Good.. good job.
I think.
ooh rando
the way Watt was positioned for a sec, I thought you had to buy her from Ralph
I love the Waluigi color, but I don't care even the slightest about Waluigi himself
it's backwards, I admit that
I instinctively almost asked "why"
these Boos know what's up
the turtle gives you the "Slow Go" badge
How was park driving from work
what is a short rando? starting with 3 cards?
I've never seen the train smash the rock
you know you don't wanna save the yoshis
don't let the challenge runners hear that
Laki can do lava but not water?
Laki isn't waterproof
I like the red penguins
but you can't use his ability right?
Can't believe that penguin fuckin died
no it's not
what is that copypasta
@Glennjaamin No I have not, thank you for asking
Np TacoGuy
why's the temple still in the sand
HOLY MOLY
then how'd you get the star spirit
yee I doing rando
I'm 3 hours in and I STILL haven't found Parakarry
I even have everything to beat Ch 3
it's just like "where the hell are you hiding"
I also think more coconuts were added
I have found waaay more than I usually do
this seed SUCKS
excuse me
thats a sin
that was a little worth it
fried goomba on the menu tonight
do you have blue key?
oh wait you have red key
what a tease
thank you Koover
Parakarry had a crash landing
no bubble tree?
He crashed his Xbox
hey hey hey
thats true
it wasn't my fault kinda
Speaking of crashes?
Coley's cursed
uh oh
THAT'S A YIKES FROM ME, DOG
I CURSED THE STREAM NotLikeThis
oh god you had lettersanity turned on??
please title the yt video as "Short Rando(?)"
oh Redd is chill
cya dude gn LUL
have you ever been in a situation where your diglet couldnt evolve when it was on like donkey Kong.. its like you needed a Mario to make it bigger but instead you get a from Mario Kart.. but it was like sonic the hedgehog but over before it started with no continues.. so you lay down like snorlax really embarrassed.. its like you need a majoras mask to cover yourself in front of princess Peach.. not the castle you wanted to show her
the decor on the castle made me think Piplup was the one talking about being cold to friendship
ah, I never got a chance to play this as a kid it's so cute! Also hey hey, GL on learning the route!
LUL -SpAtk? ouch
Golem is very friend shaped
how is iron so rare? in almost every other game ever it's gold that's hard to get
oh wow so that was really good but really bad rng LUL LUL LUL
oh jeez
... casually spinning pokemon into molten lava? what a charming game WutFace
I didn't study for no pop quiz
oh heck, tank controls on a wiimote? that's gross
platforming??? oh I gotta see that
you keep inching him closer to the lava and I'm gettin WORRIED
.... so he won't battle you? guy's a big chicken
aw heck yeah spooky time
I mean I'd not wanna meet a Tangrowth down a dark alley bro LUL
scary parties you say?
waggle warrior time
Cranidos OP LUL
I was not emotionally prepared for such a spooky Pokmon
to whom do I send my therapy bill
He more or less caused this run to happen in some shape or form
It's a very long pipeline but it does connect to him
I mean I would've
He goes to advantage states
I should run park 2 again I need a run on SRC that's not our co-op run I didn't contribute in LOL
Let's just race park 1
Park 1 doesn't ha e oshawott
So I will play 2
Park 1 has Jolteon in pre-game tho
Park 2 is post so ew
Also shake requirements
Only thing better about Park 2 is the dance zone mini game
I will be a waggle warrior for oshawott
Let's do the 3p 380 soon :)

my eevee pb doesn't have rhyhorn
my first 3:0x was so good except for that lol
i wonder how much time it loses to miss that
i feel like it's gotta be at least like 30 but overall it isn't bad
it's also worse the longer you don't have pony

Chikorita hesitated before following you in, she did it on purpose
go fast already
you go fast
dont wanna
maybe tm
you saved me, i was so bored i was tempted to play danganropa
so thx btw
Bulbasaur's a bro
i usually get treeko and my swing dependents are either aipom/ambipom or buizel/floatzel
hide and seek peasant smh
aipom would be across bridge by mankey
I've been checking throughout the day both yesterday and today to congratulate you for your run. but never lived when i checked whomLUL
and aipom spawns ambipom
aipom chase
ambi battle
your run made the English any% runs to 50
i also amused watching it to verify it
hi cinder
hi glenn
boop firework already
im scared
dont be
last any% i spent 50 seconds looking for torchic
just be a minute faster
i dont wanna relive that
i can easily bop firework all i need is to not do password pikachu for gyarados
why are you even using passwords anyways Glenn
use to do it so brain went "do it again"
i *should* come back into speedrunning
I'll just verify things
and say hi glenn when he puts it in the description
no quick kill?
decent mankey
better than my most recent mankey kills tbh
anyways hi. I'm Cinder. the main mod for Park 1 cinder23Smile
so i heard in your vod. all friends
i approve
ooo we can race :)
i.e do it at the same time
as long as your all friends any% time beats Cheez's normal any% time. you're golden
for my sanity sake
aw man I'd love to watch a race
cheez's normal any% time is like 4hr
if it seems I'm mean to Cheez, don't worry. he's my friend and LITERALLY WANTS TO BE THE WORSE PARK RUNNER
YOOO ODDISH FREE
BACK BY BRIDGe
imagine doing h&s strats whomDerp
there's basically two spots and you could see one of them during the countdown
imagine having a good time in this game gcjLUL
that headbutt of frustration pieBaited
peepoSad missing spearow jump
Pachirisu noooooo
i feel like the game would be rude to me for not playing it in so long
i'd recommend still going for golduck for the sake of gyarados attraction
pokepark was kind to me after i took a break
for all friends it was like 3 minutes or somethin
park was kind to me in a race with furi and rob when livesplit crashed and mid run i was editing whoms pokemon counter thing for Series race
and that was the last time
i might do park bingo soon cause bingo funny
also i spent like 2 hours making bingo layouts
I'm off to bed. i expect a run to verify with all of Mantis' tomorrow's gcjHi
goals are okay tbh cause they are split between attraction/friend making decently well
i shall
bye bye cinder

Froslass is gonna leave him for you PokPikachu
first mawile now this
torterra is one of the easiest fights but yall aint ready for that conversation
oH yeAH TorTERra iS eASy, juSt PusH hIM iNTO thA WaTER
not having that convo
Mamoswine wtf man WutFace "it's okay that he attempted to murder me, or at the very least imprison me in ice forever, we just have different viewpoints"
who do you think you are, bradyboo, world record holder of park 1
i still love that vid when legends was announced, where they edited the trainer over the torterra fight
okay glennjamin, 14th place holder of mario 3d world
not even my greatest achievment, you mean, glennjaamin, world record holder of every pokepark gyarado IL
who do you think you are, uhhhh idk woo #
Are you doing max dash or double dash route?
11 obv
what comes out of bonslys eyes
rainbows, of course
meowth is the poor man's backup to torchic
we dont talk about torchic
this is a funny game to listen to
you just hear random pokmon names
i love the cries in this game
tbolt her for consistency shift3
froslass just bullied glalie we caught it in 4k
now hes gotta do the crate strat to save 0.002 seconds :0
the glenn strat
actually if you pick up a crate and shove yourself into the corner you can clip into the next zone
cant wait for the summoning salt video where he talks about the glenn strat
the game was dry with runs forever until one day a discovery was found dubbed "the glenn"
if i had a nickel for every person ive convinced to play park, i would have 2 nickels
which isnt much but still surprising
brady look at what you've made him do
fricken item sliding
mf did it on the wrong side
its the only place that actually might save time
hardest thing in the game and all you do is just run against a wall ResidentSleeper
this man making the loop
i love the raichu cry. who did that with their mouth
losing half a second not picking gible smh
it's only like that cause you dont care about the bonus
if you want third stage dash get bonus with gible cause its 5k
theres like 4 options for this attraction, gible saves the most time and raichu is the easiest and most lenient
DUGTRIO NOOO
NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
just get magby
dugtrio is in the route wtf
LMAO BRADY
how have you been completing runs
Dugtrio is free as hell he's just a talk
when is eevee version?
it is i just checked lol
you know... the better version
getting gaslighted in my route
this game looks cringe
if you are following the route but skipping dugtrio im confused on how you can get past rotom without being roadblocked
he got an extra in meadow since he went ambi/aipom as well
Ohhhh ok
he should be way over atm tbh
what can Pikachu do with a gold nugget
enter the drug trade
i remember when we didnt know you can just hold the run button to run through that cutscene
we used to have to mash and it was like a 2 frame window for a 1 sec time save lol
rhyperiors is a nightmare in allfriends :(
are you a sick enough dude to be friends with rhyperior
stinky attraction
you can skip the bonus in this actually
my favorite part
oh boy
lurking playing some minecraft with pokepark sfx is not expected to be relaxing
theres no timing its honestly just buffering your inputs and mashing
agreed. still not consistent at it
drifblim is saying glenn i swear
ah yes autoscrollers my favorite
all the same lmao yeah
lmao when you put it like that
Pokepark speed runs? Interesting
I didn't know it had a battle system like this
Cheer10 gg
thousands upon thousands to save 5 seconds at the end of the day
now do it again
Same lol
Jibca gets here in like 6 hours
Ooh where you going?
Combo breaker
Do a rando on the plane
Nice, have fun!
Loaf tweeted about mn smash being negatively different since 2019 and I'm glad finally someone brought it up lol
I've been talking to jibca about that for months
YO RIDDLES JOINING TEAM LIQUID
It's weird to explain but like the energy is just different, the top end is just shitters and then there's a gap for the twins and failbot and some of the TO's running shit now are just eugh
Mainly just the TO for saturday shit who is currently being ratiod absurdly hard in loafs replies LOL
But yea I'm not engaging with the twitter end of that because there's no reason to
So I just posted a mario odyssey weed mario
MORE SPLITS
DOUBLE LIVE
But yea Idk why people are that surprised about loafs tweet, it's the reason Jibca won't play ultimate for the most part
Like he has gripes with the game itself but he's said to me he mainly won't go to shit because he just doesn't care for the people anymore
He'll come with for me and jaemi tho on some occasions
Yea when I went to AS I was like "Oh I should talk to people and whatever" then I got there and realized besides lucky who do I really wanna talk to there besides hanging out with like jaemi and failbot lol
Cause plant isn't there
If brady goes I'll hangout with him tho
I didn't get to meet him that was the one week he didn't go lol
GL PHANTOM I WILL MIGRATE TO BED TO WATCH
Brady I'm likely gonna be at like every AS in june so go to those
i wasnt at todays either lol
I wanted to go today but work + ride isn't in town currently
did they halve his coin requirement
I haven't played since rando patch 1 lol
i have no idea what you look like taco so you have to be the one to find me
look at any of aurawolfs sets from last AS besides the lucky one and I'm right behind him
Also this seed is very good
It has goombario
Bow is pretty good at hide and seek
She had a good spot
Goombario is the best tho that's why you never get him usually
The only reason :)
Surely you would never find him and leave
He's just a good hider
But yea I've felt a similar thing to the st cloud people for like months too lol
Like I pretty much just go to hangout with the TO, Shrumble, and Jaemi
Old ass
everyone is so weird at locals
what do i expect though its a local LOL
MN locals are very interesting crowds
But yea at st cloud shit I'll play Wario for Jaemi obv and then I'll play it for the people I know genuinely want to improve and want the exp
But for the shitters I will just go falco
hes going to go falco vs me NotLikeThis
The more I play falco the more I think fuck that character
He has too much shit
Thank god jaemi can't do the IDJ loops LOL
I mash that shit and get 60 for free into kill situation
the 2 things my falco does that jaemi can't
I can dragdown fair off neutral win
And I can IDJ combo
im just an 0-2 but i keep up with everyone in friendlies just fine and win decent amount of them so im fine :)
But then he's just better everywhere else lol
Fuck falco
@Bradybooo I'm playing seph now so I can tell you shit
My seph already going positive in game count in friendlies with aurawolf
Footstool dair is so fucking good for falco murdering
seph wins the matchup tho
They did once
Because lucky isn't my r3 anymore
lemme check again
Seph def wins but like
If I'm not doing good shit I will get falco'd very hard against him
Was very funny at AS last week because Failbot let Jaemi pick yoshis because Failbot mained mario before steve
you have to spam alot of fair in the matchup
And now he perma bans it lol
AS stagelist is some ass tho
Isn't it just everything besides NC
Cause that list is good lol
dont need 3 triplats bro :(
Yea that's a good stage list
It's everything besides HB and NC
and then theres town and kalos and fd
This is just a good stagelist with 3 bans lol
replace kalos and lylat and we chilling
Aight so you're one of those
Starters: Battlefield, Final Destination, Pokemon Stadium 2, Smashville, Town & City Counterpicks: Small Battlefield, Kalos, Lylat Cruise, Yoshi's Story
it does
That's why it's good
it used to have 2 bans like a month ago
It's just the st cloud ruleset besides the fact that it's 3 ban instead of mdsr
2 bans with that stagelist is a nightmare though. 3 is aight
I just need 1 ban for fd
then I'm chillin
FD ain't even bad for me I just don't like it
i played friendlies with jackypoo for my first time at the local for an hour and then i got the dude r1 in bracket
Ezekiel3 YO A THIRD ONE
how shitty is that
They made aurawolf my r3 despite us playing every month in st cloud and also me putting a note on the reg to not do that lol
Like besides failbot I'm the one who would beat jaemi in that venue but I don't wanna do that early lol
Cause MN has no defensive players besides failbot, Jaemi runs his offense to hell and back on people
you say that but half of our region plays steve and samus
and then theres the megamans that carried over from s4
im super sadge about it too theres so many steves and i havent fought one yet. like its a super good matchup for Seph I actually WANT to fight steve
Mirai is a masher so them playing steve doesn't count for that
I've played a buncha friendlies with failbot tho he's a bitch
Cool ass dude but fuck playing him LOL
My bracket hasn't changed since this week lemme name search you
Yep the same
Jaaahsh is in your pool after that lol
Beat his ass
He plays bayo right
thas free
Haus is cool af
get along with him very well at AS and he doesnt play like a bitch its nice
Keep in mind ikan has a powerful mind, he doesn't have a twitter so he is at full mental capacity
they will flood the stage so you can pushed up
you get
What if they put me in jesse's pool and I won
Also AK didn't go to this for some reason
Kinda wanted to beat his ass in bracket
One of my fgc to's is in jesse's pool lol
Proc might have to play DaddyDan r2, they're probably not good but if he loses to Daddy fucking Dan I'm not letting him live it down
im going to bed gn all
The tag is just really good lol
I'm very surprised I'm seeded to leave my pool
I have a top 60 seed somehow
I'm seeded to lose to #2 in chicago and get to top 96 that way
YO TOP NASB CONTENT!?!?!?
You're fucked
He's gonna turn off the voices and start moving
Ok just saw some dude on twitter reply to someone draw genshin protag as black and got offended over it and their pinned tweet was some shit about twitter likes not mattering so I checked there's
And it's anime feet bot posts
what even is the internet
YEA THEIR LAST LIKE
IS FROM "FeetHentaiBot"
jesus fucking christ the likes are all cosplay onlyfans and crinkly foot hentai
That's enough twitter for now I'm going to lab smash for a bit
Do it again
but did you do funny jump
maybe I should look at the screen huh
my b
You get a Drake
If I manage to get top 24 winners I play ned
I'd have to beat steve to do that....
Path before is #2 in IL who plays lucina, I've played before and it went ok
Into lucky which I can very much win
Set with lucky at AS was 2 last hit games that went absurdly close to time lol
I also SD'd game 2
At 20
But it was kalos so after I hit the waft I was big fucking chillin on the plats
Also was demonstrated where his defense lacks because he played jaemi right after
And got shit on LOL
It's so fun watching people play him for the first time
People aren't used to not being allowed to play without having good defensive play
And then Falco hits you twice
Yea me and Jaemi play the exact same with eachother in wifi sessions and there's so many spots where we're mutually like "Yea he hit that offline" so it makes it way easier to mentally play long sessions with him online lol
Ah yes the pinnacle of good option = always good and not looking at why people use the option in a scenario
option = good option*
Why would you ever BW outside of combo without techchase or projectile read
Also wanted to update my mods because I haven't for a bit and had things to add
And realized pc doesn't have an sd slot lol
Yea I wish I wasn't lazy about updating mods and did it sooner
Cause i wanted to add more music before cb lol
I want that new geese theme
Why do my weed mario tweets do better than my clips
I have a weed mario folder now
It has 6 whole unique weed marios
Honestly I'm feeling kinda confident I could place my seed
This bracket isn't too bad honestly
Maister won coinbox after DQ'ing r1 for a covid test lol
what game is this?? hmm well judging from the graphics and the obvious age of the relic I would have to say It would be GARBAGE.. GARBAGE FROM KING GARBAGE FROM THE GARBAGE DYNASTY lol
he won 19 sets in a row on wifi
hahah how are u dude
how long is the flight
u going to combo breaker.. bruuh.. u didn't u say something we could've room and stuff lol
and I would've gone
still would've paid for my share lol
buy the soda
it's refreshing
anyway good luck ok
I'm bringing the ps4 to the airbnb so we can fuck around with kof
I haven't played since launch lol
I just kinda bought it to support the game cause I had extra money and it looked fun but then the matchmaking was ass and no friends had it lol
They still haven't fixed matchmaking but the lobbies are good
Tempted to buy marvel 3 to fuck around too since none of us actually play it it'd be fun
there will be no vergil or morrigan fuckery
I played it a tiny bit with 74 because he bought it for me and it was fun
We just fucked around and didn't lab combos so it was just flailing and it was great
Wdym you don't have a spare dreamcast + crt to fly with lol
I found the original render that was given weed and I can't look at mario the same
could you lzs from that top entry wall onto that table for the item
like if you scew it right
didn't lzs from the clock to that table smh
yea but you lose coolness factor
People are streaming morbius on the artifact category LOL
I DONT KNOW
BUT IT'S MORBIN TIME
I'm putting this up on the other monitor
it's 10 minutes in
aw hell yea they got subtitles too
Jesse is watching it rn too with bear from a separate vod LMAO
The chat is just only saying it's morbin time
holy shit what is this camera work
They just had the slowest fucking shaky cam running scene
and nobody was chasing him LOL
a snack for later
I'm hungry, you don't wanna see me when I'm hungry, he's about to morb I think
he's morbing
CHANNEL GOT BANNED NOOOO
I'm so sad now
I wanted to do a little morbing
i am trying to hook up a wiimote to my computer and having problems
can we watch morbius tomorrow
yeah connecting it is easy it is getting it to do anything that is hard
It wasn't interesting or good from the first 30 minutes but I also want to morb
if you are using dolphin than they have it set up so you can use it easily
but i am trying to use it on stuff that is isn't wii games
Someone is watching revenge of the sith in artifact category lol
so it is hard
That's what it's always been wdym
It's always been hentai and free movies LOL
There is nobody playing this game there's currently streams for Dune, Spongebob, and King of the Hill
was it ever alive
what robotics club were you in in high school?
yeah I am doing that right now
my team is going to egypt over the summer
yeah they have districts now in addition to regionals now
5HSNK 6OI!!!
ermm ... thank you
I need this escape rn
@Axl_Sensei Drake
well we still had to drive 2.5 hours to portland for one of our district events so
my shift is looking like 5 or 6 am send halp!
i don't live as far north as Seattle so
I'll be in bed around 8am
I wish that seed in the cave was a trap lmao
so was doesn't annoy me as much as when people think that washington state doesn't exist and just think that Washington dc is the only one
you coming to orlando?
chicago has buff00n so it's worse
one day we'll do the phantom_axl meet up
when I get there it will be better tho
also I have a clip for you
but not now, I'm on mobile
yes, it's worth sharing again LUL
(New game)!
fucking hate new game
Well I'm not a weeb and didn't know that existed sooo
so tell us, what's it like to miss a 25 six times KEKW
typo, I'm blaming auto correct
Maybe it's good I never made you play windwaker you'd still be doing pg skip
so tonight being thurs
if I'm not too tired I'll try rando again
finish and raid me I'm gonna stream while I practice/lab
I'm looking at 45 hours in 4 days
I was gonna a while ago but then there was morbing and I also wanted to watch this seed
no raid Me! I'll be live in 16 hours
He has a good point do that
train station?
my brother offered me a job doing data entry, very considering it
he runs an insulation company
what game are you making
it starts a tadpole
is this a passion project?
don't forget to include a rando mode
why do you think pape rando is so successful?
making video games is hard i am trying to make a board game though
yeah i have like almost everything done for the board game it is just kinda broken in how it plays
is that good?
so it needs to be tweaked
BEST WAIFU
sending that image to komari and dalus
so when bn6 buster only?
did you change your mind yet?
falzar buster only you heard it chat!
time to go back
my bombette mashing is bad
have a safe flight
ok have successfully packed clothes a whole 3 hours before leaving
went to the restroom and randomly remembered I didn't do that lol
I literally only have jeans and most my shirts look the same so it wouldn't have mattered I can do it in 5 minutes LOL
YO THERE'S A NEW MORBIUS ACCOUNT
I CAN WATCH
THE THIRD MORBIUS247
aw hell yea he's already morbing
i don't get how the yoshi's get home after you save them like do they swim through the water or something
this opening sequence is just alien but morbed
couldn't you havealso just mega quaked everyone
Wanna become famous? Buy viewers, followers and primes on yourfollowz. com
no fuck you
it would be a neat touch that if a shyguy is holding slow go the shy guy moved super slow
and if speedy spin it moves super fast
but no one plays without always speedy spin so that would never happen
whens the always slow go setting
just go faster
have you thought about adding a out of logic option to the tracker?
he's morbing again
only 25 minutes of shit that didn't matter but he's doing it again
wouldn't it be better the upgrade fp once than to the thing where your fp+hp go down that way you get even more bp
what is the condition for the crash?
oh i have just never encounterd the crash
my switch won't turn on uh oh
It booted cfw weirdly and loaded home but then it turned off
oh ok we good
Removed SD and waiting a while holding the power button got a vanilla boot
you know why I will never encounter a problem with my switch
because i don't have one
If they release a switch pro I am 100% just going to full homebrew this one and get that
the switch that I want is one that i can get for free
i have a feeling Nintendo isn't ever going to come out with the switch that I want though
Hai hai.
As usual.
How were the badge BP costs in this seed?
wait you can damage hallway through the star sheild
Oh my god.
What the ****.
oh thought it was like final where he has 99 def
is there only two enemies in the game with 99 def
the chat is back to morbing after a brief break to spam "Have sex" for one specific scene
This movie is boring as shit so far LMAO
It's literally only entertaining because of the morbposting
raid morbius_247
Just raid yourself.
And then stream more.
how long till you leave for the flight
Have fun with that, by the way.
you wanna vc after you get ready
Cause I got 2 and a half hours to burn lol
and froslass kinda sus
I feel that ...
uhm ... people usually tell me "give yourself small goals so you can enjoy it all the way" or something of the sort
not like I know how to do that lol
basically so you can feel that "yay I did something!" all the way
yo gl phantom
pb'ing is like a gift tbh, i never expect it
so uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
that new pkmn professor speaks my language
I've not seen anything about the game, but the lady definitely speaks to B
I don't know but I really liked the peach segments in this game the one time I played it... though I got the cake wrong so many times lol
the timing bit always screwed me as a kid
tell me
kid b SUCKED at video games
what a jerk
Good luck!
I'd propose a "RESET" command for channel points, but that sounds godawful on paper
no pun intended
Heyo glgl
That's so fair
Tyty, played not like garbage and made a baller call for checks.
It won't happen again.
Hai hai.
I'm alright. You?
I'd hope I know it with the amount I watch
I'm farming up a Magnamalo in Monster Hunter Rise (think very spicy cat). It refuses to drop its' 3% chance gem.
I need one more gem for one last Handicraft deco. >:I
I'm 82 Magnamalos deep at this point.
Fair. My Sword and Shield needs the Handicraft deco to just barely get into a sliver of white sharpness, and then I'm using the decos that give me 90 seconds of unlimited sharpness after sharpening.
The Daora Switchaxe can get white sharpness pretty easily with like, one handicraft.
I'm a bowgunner. I don't see a problem with Daora. Haha.
I'm terrified of the Valstrax. Not because I die to the ambush ( I don't), but, I'm terrified of it because public lobbies die to it repeatedly.
mh rise? pumped for sunbreak
will need to shake off some rust soon
I'm HR 247 at this point. Def getting Sunbreak.
feel like i've had launches like that. sometimes your heart just isnt in it
I think that I've just barely surpassed my MH Gen HR at this point. And I need to get to like.. 380 to surpass my MH4U HR.
i think I'm actually around 380 in rise
I went through 3U with nothing but a Heavy Bowgun.
i loved 4u
Online didn't exist yet, but I did all of the 3U online stuff solo. With a HBG.
i can understand that
My dainty hands are perfect for the 3DS.
sucks. ive felt that way about my switch, but i bought a grip that helps
Anyways. For the S&S set, I'm remaking my old Teostra S&S set, as it had some redundancies, and wasn't really a mixed set yet, not truly.
i prefer docked mode for sure, just like the option
It now consists of: Blast Attack III, Protective Polish III, Evade Extender III, Speed Sharpening III, Critical Eye II (not super relevant, incidental), Handicraft 3 because the Teostra S&S just barely gets a sliver of white sharpness from III, Teostra Blessing II, Crit Boost I (incidental), Fortify I.
So, blast attacks. Normally you get like.. one blast off every.. Minute or so? I get 1-3 blasts off per S&S combo.
Well yeah, hence why I said that.
1-3 blasts per combo is insane.
By giving actually decent weapons that have status on them.
Instead of like.. 130 power dual blades.
Do you mind if I spout builds at you? I like sharing this stuff.
Like, I'd like to share my LBG build, but don't want to keep throwing numbers at you.
I have min-maxed my Zinogre LBG to that absolute maximum that it can be. Literal perfect Talisman and everything.
Bow S-tier and so fun
Spare Shot III, Normal/Rapid Up III, Ammo Up III, Reload Speed III, Recoil Down III, Rapid Fire Up III, Evade Extender III, Counterstrike II.
Yea for real HR 380 and i dont have a single god talisman
I can easily swap Evade for Ballistics if I want, but typically don't.
Love my zooms.
And my nyooms.
Welcome back Phantom
Rapid Morph.
Daora Switchaxe: Protective Polish III, Focus III, Speed Sharpening III, Wirebug Whisperer III, Rapid Morph III, Power Prolonger II, Constitution II, Evade Extender II, Crit Eye I, Dragon Attack I (redundant, incidental), Handicraft I, Marathon Runner I, Stamina Surge I.
Yeah it is. Haha.
I have so much fun with the mix sets in Rise. They're so good compared to older games.
Building a new set is my favorite type of puzzle.
I can't remember if I've previously mentioned that in like, 4U, I farmed just over 8,000 Black Gravios to get a single gosh darn Black Gravios heart.
key be like: HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream HypeScream
Yes it is.
I had max zenny several hundreds of times over.
From all those parts.
Here goes Magnamalo 83. Wish me luck!
The desire sensor in MH games for me is real.
It's so unforgiving.
It's real for me, all of the time.
The second I get one gem, it'll drop four of them.
hehe i got 6.9 k points :3
and now it went up to 7k -_-
No gem. Two plates though. >:I
you planing of doing a rando if the run dies?
stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence stickshamPence
Do you wanna know how many plated I have?
best character
Seventy freaking six.
Oh I plan to.
Or, or it could not die
anything can happend
green station can't wa-
Very clean #84. No gem.
This video game is going to give me that which I desire. >:I
Oh god. I ran out of Normal 2's in my box, from fighting this thing.
I keep about 10k stocked at all times.
Yes, Meine Fuhrur.
Bad joke? :(
I'm German. I couldn't help myself.
I spelled Fuhrer wrong.
I blame Magnamalo.
So, wanna know where all my luck goes to?
Spare Shot for the LBG.
It has a 20% chance of activating with Spare Shot III.
It feels like it activates 80% of the time.
That's where my luck goes.
I'm not complaining, but like, that's where ALL of my luck goes.
My record is 31 Spare Shot procs in a row.
#85 complete. No gem.
It really does not. I'm used to this.
We press on! #86.
#86 done. No luck.
Can we hit 100? ;_;
I mean, I might as well at this point.
It's fine. it's adding up the LBG hunts on my Guild Card.
did you get the jam?
don't forget it
go fast
thats what they all say
so 3dw 2p on saturday?
even more pog
We love successful coin flips
Hahahaha. Oh my god. So, I'm fighting #87 and I accidentally hit a Jaggi with two slicing shots. The Magnamalo then hit it with a tail uppercut. The Magnamalo SENT THAT JAGGI TO THE SHADOW REALM. I know this, because I could see the slicing shot numbers going off about.. oh... 6,000 miles under the world.
someone else actually reached out to me about doing 2p runs that wasnt in our immediate freind group
Also, no gem.
Nice gold.
aggro ass bee
i bee with you hehe
When you're under less pressure from Paper Mario, please do read my above message when you have a chance.
I'm dying of laughter.
its melvin, that eu guy that crushed the 2p boards earlier
No worries. I understand that you're a wee bit focused.
he asked as if he needed any credentials for it and stated his any% time which is jokes cause i know that man is goated at 2p
Like, I knew that the small monsters can get sent to the Shadow Realm, but, I didn't expect it to be down that far.
the funny thing is i would do the same thing cause im awkward af for collabs
im down to race ya in park any% after if ya want
I think that I'm gonna take a break after #88. My head is starting to hurt.
yeah im rusty af in any% i completely forgot you can save and quit in lava zone until i saw brady do it in the bingo race
good keep saving time and such
parakarry had some trouble
#88 done. No gem. Break time.
I have so many Friend Vouchers now.
All of the Talisman farming.
I'm gonna finagle a snack together.
I should hope so.
bruh, Bowser has the Star Rod
he could've fixed that window a long time ago
There's a hall there?
yeah, cuz there's probably still glass on the floor
if he ain't wished the window fixed, he sure as heck ain't vacuumed
Cinnamon bun. :D
Oh, it is pretty good right now.
I try to eat healthy, but, I feel like I've earned this. LuL
Add a small bit of chicken for something extra?
Hmm.. Maybe I'll make a salad for dinner tomorrow too. The idea is sounding better and better by the minute.
spinach > lettuce
I'm not a fan of spinach, but I LOVE Brussels Sprouts.
I use spinach in place of lettuce
I totally agree.
spinach cooked into the yolk of an omelet
You ever just bonk actual Kooper there because he pissed you off that day?
Kooper isn't Goombario
Phantom would 1000000000000% whack Goombario
Bombette down there like Charmander in the early Pokemon episode where its' trainer didn't want it, like.. "He's coming back, right?"
Welp. Now that I've had my snacco, I'm gonna go punish myself by playing DBD.
Good luck with the rest of the run!
i don't get it why bowser have more clown carts?

NI NO KUNI?
do we really need to kill zelda if they're just botw posting now
give me more top down games if you're not going to do anything close to TP's quality for the 3d ones please
The remake for LA was really good but the base game was just mid
why was there naked people for 2 seconds
FF16 looks epic
thats it
I'm ngl I don't really care for the current final fantasy combat style
It just feels too damage spongey to make anything really satisfying
good to have you back, I popped in yesterday but mobile data was shit
Berseria felt really good to me, just had to position my people well and my big hits usually actually did damage to health bars
click bait tweet lmao
playstation 4 is gonna be rad
it's been out for so long and yet nobody has one still
did you get your day 1?
i played miles, GT7, and Kena
you would had to wait to play miles on ps4
elden ring is the only open world game i've ever enjoyed
do you know how the lzs trainer works in new fp?
botw can suck my re-hashed 3 mechanics dick
too many streams I wanna watch rn >_<
komari starting exe4
me right now
one of my friends was streaming pape rando today but he was using the other tracker. Was first time I saw someone not use yours. I like how small everything was leaving more space in the overlay, but yours is just so much cleaner.
yeah, was just my gut reaction
what was your highlight for combo breaker
yo glgl
i cant wait to work every day for the rest of my life :)
it's been chill at least tho
i have a 45 min commute each way until i move into a new place in early july where it'll be 5 mins instead
so it'll be nice to have another 1.5 hours back in my day
that sounds lit
there is always bn6 buster only KEKW
fat run
the last letter?
or the first?
ah okay
that one sucks ass
yeah having saves makes practice so easy
youve almost caught up to mitzi shes getting portrait now
timers are 7 minutes off, this race is intense
its a race to me
you just gave her a handicap
yeah sp[lit after peach
I meme about it
why cant we all just have the same splits Sadge
"strimer u forgotz 2 splitz agin"
Hai hai.
monday I wanted to do rando but didnt have time so I made a seed for next time so I can just go lol
I see green.
oh also, mark and I are doing rando race tues, wanna join?
we havent picked a time yet
normally I work on sundays so need to find other times for races lol
how does it learn?
damn she just go tthe key
you so close
yeah before I do my first run I want to look over intermidiate route and see if theyre anything i wanna go for
what about bombette in the pit?
i might be confusing routes then
i do remember seeing routes where they use her in the pit
nmb that mustve been it
bro, im no fake gamer
eating mushroom is the best 7 seconds you can spend in a first few runs
oh i just rmemebed
dont I need a windows 98 for that?
i remember having a windows 95 as a kid
then 98 was a huge deal
I hate lantern ghost
he gave me goombario once
so what is the strat using watt on lantern?
I failed 3 power shocks in a row!!!
like turn 1 powerr shock?
oh no she reset
she was in toy box but wasnt paying close attention
she threw lantern KEKW
i get that too
ezekiel is a good dog
shared a jade jungle remix you need to hear in #music
tonight im gonna look at the file that came on my jpn cart
yeah, risch did that once with exe6, they traded all the recovs so he couldnt beat gregar LMAO
cool thing about bn is its not just folder build but navicust too
is it faster take stairs or hit lava at the end there
sometimes i get an error when I boot my everdrive, I just reset til it works
I got it with a loaded card so have been using that
How long have you been running PM?
Ive been looking into learning TTYD glitchless, but I enjoy watching runs of both games.
ttyd gless is a fucked up run
but i enjoy it a lot
i'd enjoy it more if it didn't take 6.5 hours
Exactly. I'd want to take a few weeks to learn the routing well before going for runs in TTYD
i do a run every few weeks just to keep fresh, but it requires too much time to do more often
theyre fine yeah
they're a little clunky, but they work well
power bounce in TTYD is weird always imo. this game feels better
if you're gonna do a gless run let me know, theres a route change you should 1,000% do
I felt that with power bounce when moving to PM after playing TTYD a lot
What do you enjoy more at the moment?Speedruns or Randomizer for PM?
I found your stream through your randomizer runs on YouTube.
Yep, I get that lol
The first game I tried to learn to speedrun was Sunshine the cutscenes and everything at the start was too long for me lol
I enjoyed my casual play throughs of it, it's a really fun game
My wife who never plays video games even played through it with me
I gotta head to bed since I get up early for work (I'm on EST). I'll probably watch the replay of the vod tomorrow though. Keep up the good pace!
getting pretty tired, plan is nap for 2 hours then stream but well see how that goes lol
thanks for the stream
good luck
yo gl
thicc door 1
yeahm unblock claw, charge, switch to bow, bounce/outta sight > bounce

or para
parakarry fight is a scam
yeah if you have super watt it helps
turbo charge clutch
did you just eat the life shroom
unblocked fire does 9 iirc
gg man
that was a sick run
blame the bad run on the Malort's
better than apple cider vinegar
this is rando, mate
no prologue around these parts
all my homies hate prologue
call the file Malort's
you should be able to sell badges in rando
more coins based on their BP
A fuzzy threw it in the ? Block cuz it knows Kooper lacks hops
HECK YEAH, DUDE
that's gross
Mario HATES Repel Gels
he's a diva who wants EVERYONE to see him

*one slap* bitch
gl gamer
I heard from Axl that you're doing BN4 after this run
yeah same, I had a good pace run for the first 30m in my last run
like insane pace actually
but then the next 3 splits were trash
both bad RNG and some misplays on my end
Simply eat bowser
reverse bowsers inside story
tomorrow's the last chance for BN4 COPIUM
yeah switching to 5 because I got bopped there
NGO Pog
BN5 is chill, has every possible RNG in BN basically
It's gonna be 10 fp
@buff00n I'm subbed so I outrank you so you shush

he speaks
y'know goombario would be able to help knock them down

I need him to start morbing again
morph could never
MegaDie? I've heard of that band.

Watching pokemon runs and thinking, "why is pignite's cry a wet fart?"

I met iwata before
he was a good man
we played each other in Mario kart
I was up till 5 cause stomach issues then called out of work because I had to be there at 9 and like I didn't want to at that point
man I still miss him
We already had people there so I don't feel too bad about it I was just there to help with a load
the toad is telling you secrets
Burger king is doing gay burgers now

I had the perfect response to Taco's tweet
I was about to tell you that reply was really good LOL
Plant RT'd it now all of minnesota will see double weed

I was originally going to send Taco a different response

I'm going to card war
you're a grown ass man, read the card text.

Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
I think that was the fastest I've reacted to one of those LOL
also "mountviewers . com" Flushed
didn't even get a chance to buy any aceari4NormanSadge
no space between . and com
this is a family friendly stream no mounting viewers
now if only they could send weed Mario
from sending weed mario?
Looked at strive mods to see if they had any good millia colors and every mod is just horny
I just want a good purple one I don't need to see barefoot millia mods
I don't think the slight modification worked
How is there nothing but purple for smash mods but I can't find a single good purple mod for strive
oop there's the nude mods
why are these here
where's the nude Wario mod?
the cowards haven't given me that power yet
Ok found 1 good mod that's just one of her reds from xrd that looks nice
WHY IS THERE LIKE 5 VARIANTS OF THE NUDE MOD
I KEEP SCROLLING AND MORE SHOW UP
we were looking through mods and found a comment on one of them and they asked where Nude Wario was and it got liked and upvoted
ok I found a good purple fucking finally
At the bottom of the page someone made an alt that's of my unist character
ooo they made ones for all of eltnums alts too
evo tweet is interesting

what comes out of state so i found you here on twitch :D
mx_four: what comes out of state so i found you here on twitch :D
your bot has done a lot of ezekiel roleplay
EzekielHD : You have allowed Ezekiel2 to twist your mind, until now... until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy. Ezekiel : Don't lecture me, EzekielHD ! I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear Ezekiel2 as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire. EzekielHD : Your new empire?

bombette misses the ch7 switch if she is on top of it
it is very funny
i mean literally on top
i did that a few weeks ago lmfao
i hope your chat is more helpful than mine
who the fuck voted against me
i chose to be helpful (this time)
look at that sceptile
i've lurked a bit
that's what I bought jesse last year
but i do not know what the fuck is going on
Pikachu is making friends and kicking ass
45x better than arceus
i did NOT have fun
i defended it when it came out but god it's not fun lmao
45 minutes of text mashing and i wanted to quit
that voice for mew is awful i'm offended
let's go is so good
Oh yea I got to play brady on wednesday
ive heard of this game but never seen it before
We only played a few games, the first one was close then I 3 stocked him a couple times lol
He's solid but he didn't have an answer for when I had answers to him
no but I assume it's frowned upon by god
hey dont call me out like that
it's shameful whether or not this other guy exists
are glitchless attempts shameful or painful
Ok I went through all that to get my purple millia but I've ended up liking this red and white one the most anyways lol
It's just the same colors as my Titania alt for ike in ult
dark red and white kinda just works for me
I'll send you a pic of the alt
When talking to jibca about fe9 and 10 he said "You can't tell me that Titania isn't the most perfect woman to come out of FE"
the bot is being abused in komaris stream
that was accurate footage of me buying my giant plush at combo breaker
at this point in paper mario we are talking to goompa
I've been told sf6 is gonna have macros for command inputs and I don't think there's been any shown drawbacks to using them yet so that's a bit wack
But those are needed to balance move accessing it's just going to be worse to have them on
Ok that's a bad drawback LOL
Hai hai. : D
oddish might have the most stereotypical high pitched asian woman voice ive ever heard
I did. On #91. But as we discussed, naturally, not only did I get one gem, but I got two from #91. Naturally.
croagunk is like a 15 year old who's been downing 2 packs a day since he was 5
he is also frogkin
I told you. It always works that way.
What is your least favorite section of this game and why is it the Mew jump?
this was a pathetic showing
that mf won worlds
But yeah, I finished my Teostra S&S set off of that Magnamalo gem. I also made a Bazelguise Dual Blade set by changing a couple things out for Marathon Runner and I then got an insanely good Talisman. Evade Extender III + Counterstrike I + a 3 slot deco slot.
God tier Talisman. : D
OBSTACLE HOP MY BELOVED
YO HE GOT HOPS
I'm still waiting for the obstacle hop.
I didn't see any obstacles, nor any hopping.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wish I had optimal friends
I just have buff00n
he loses me a lot of time with his late ass
y'know I can't call him dumbass now without thinking of that carride and what jesse said
the clowncar was a curse
I did not go into combo breaker thinking we couldn't fit in a car because buff00n had a dumpy
ok i don't miss that part of smash
yea so m4 that whole weekend we had buff00n driving and 4 of us in the back and it was ok
Then 1 ride we let proc drive instead and we genuinely couldn't fit in the back anymore
Buff00n isn't even large he's a very average sized person
he just has a dumpy
I always think that's a partner badge at first glance
yes im partner now
the first streamless partner
Technically that was jesse
Cause he never streamed without partner
Panda just said here you go
woah is this the secret Paper Mario 64 chapter?
Did you play through the new Pokemon Snap, by chance?
while I was in the back, TacoGuyy STAYED slamming into me every chance he got
Oh, yeah. I felt that too.
"Just took a dump on the run so I'm excited to see how that goes lol "
"you are now friends" -bashes them into the water-
are you REALLY friends if you DON'T make them eat shit every now and then???
taking you to child hell
you know about drifloon picking up children right?
I tried to time 'em out, but Taco was too quick on the draw
He was playing splattytoon
Love live game LMFAO
There is 1 on the ps4
is there one that isn't a gacha
ain't playing no love live game
That has $150 plus worth of dlc
your setting a bad example for the bidoof
Grandma wants to fight
why do no gios like to block
I'm just doing fake shit and they keep getting counterhit
Taco race me and Phantom in Park tm
I work the weekend
Gio has an anti-air dp
It's a 6p but big
feraligatr holdin ya back
ok I guess ky dp sucks
I misinputed an airdash and I just went through it entirely LOL
more like bitch zone
the first hit of may super off counterhit 2h
I hate it here
at least let me die to the full thing
millia please eat your wheaties
now i'm playing a floor 10 leo with level 2 thousand
he's going to mash help
@TacoGuyy try turning it off and on?
when he does back turn dash
he literally just appears there
it was just gamble between grab and block overheard
I took a round though because I hit him once and he kept DPing
this dudes message says "Jack-o thigh enjoyer"
oh boy a level a billion ram
Glalie got no hoes
why are you beating his ex wife
ok that justifies it
Ezekiel3 is down NOOOOO
I love his run cycle
he just go boing
I'm looking at the sonic frontiers gameplay and why did they slowdown sonic so much
This is the game where you want to just fucking run around and they didn't want to do that
they have auto turnaround
mawile of a shoyo
regardless how Frontiers' is received critically, I'd like Sega to review what works/doesn't work when making the next Sonic game
but, this Sega. so
They literally just have to make sonic move fluid and fun and make a world that's fun to move around in
But that's too hard
How's it that literally everyone has an idea of what they want Sonic to be BESIDES Sega???
the comics are killing it
the movies have performed phenomenally
like all they had to do to make frontiers a fun game is just make sonic move fast and responsive and let him run around the mountains and shit
the Mania devs said "we wanna make a Classic Sonic game" and they did
But he's slow as fuck lol
Like the whole thing that makes the old sonic games good is how they play with momentum
You have to path things so that you can keep your momentum and they let you go fast for it
Now you just go on rails and hit a boost button sometimes
Rush series lacked momentum, but the charm was keeping your boost gauge filled as you blasted through the stage at full speed
Hell, Modern Sonic was just Rush but 3D, but Sonic refused to let it stand on its own
see: Werehog, Wisps, Classic Sonic then Classic plus the OC thing in Forces
if a Sonic game was just Modern stages from Generations the entire game, people probably would've loved it
but Sega refused to let Modern gameplay stand on its own merits
do me afavor a get a pb thanks
do me a favor and reset
hiiii dude all three bug fables plushy got funded in like 8 hours it's crazy!
I'm buying a vi one

deadMario deadMario deadMario deadMario
he couldn't handle the weed
I don't think so?
I don't remember a golem voice
Twink <- a murderer
why is he a murderer? lol
I haven't heard that one even in pm64 speedrunning back in the day
deadMario he's fucking dead
twink fuckin killed him
Twink look at this face
a cold blooded killer
why is twink giving brain damage?
you know I expected that meme to be way better :(
Any game mod that removes leggings/stockings from a character is downgrade in my eyes
Brand new WHAT Flushed
I'm going to pop that balloon
Damn this is actually kinda intense
Cuz all it takes is someone's wifi to slip up and the run is over
wait where the smash bros at .. also ub going to double down
im a throwe :)
I threw so hard
huff happened and i cri
but HEY 22:09 new gold for prologue so yay
gonna get some food brb
back with food :3 so this speedrun requires two people?
Mario's not allowed in 2P speedruns cuz he says "OH, SHIT" every time he gets the crown
this game feels like toads treasure tracker but on steroids
just gold every split and boom sub 2 hrs yeah? Kappa
I've been influenced by the influencer
toad kitty is cute
head a little mishapen but other than that CUTE
Are you having fun? : D
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
Wanna become famous? Buy followers, primes and viewers on mountviewers .com
i couldnt think of what to say lol
I've awakened from my nap
something about golem operating a machine is hilarious
you wont believe what I found
my old megaman battle network 5 player guide LUL
I found mine for red/blue, emerald, and platinum
about to grab some food
i little self conscious about not adding more, but im not beating myself over it.
rando race is about to start but I skipping today, kinda exhausted rn
I was gonna do glitchless runs today but then i took a nap and ate an edible so... not happening lmao
i just did one yesterday and didnt have the drive to finish
paper mario needs swords MissedASword
leave it. it's perfect
its fine, you said youll be starting bn3 anyways KEKW
im just here to remind you I didnt forget LUL
wasnt dinglez the only one to complete a SS run?
@Axl_Sensei good stuff on commentary earlier
i just came back with food, did you forget to reset before starting?
yo! thanks buffoon. Glad you were able to catch it
My brain doesnt register prologue if I'm being completely honest
I wanna do a prologue marathon
though recently ive been trying to focus on my spin timing and lines for prologue
How many prologues can I do in 5 hours?
i am looking forward to having taquitos for dinner oh muh goodness
im running mashed potatoes, mushroom soup, and hamburger
oh that sounds good too axl
I average 11:07 goombario
sub 11 goombario soon? BLANKIES
a whole year :O that's how you know all the tech
aww damn, bn3 is the follower goal. Gonna be waiting a hot minute for that
he is doing his best
My average prologue is 22:14 papeHands
But I mean I have been running it for less than a month so I guess that aint too bad LUL
im confused. I have a prologue split at 21.28... that cant be right
maybe I split at the summit?
Axl the prologue god ayo?
no switch is trash
you said 2209 LUL
I said 2209 about me
he def said 22:03
least likely? okay Mr. Seventh Try Speedy
axl really has it out for you tonight LUL
trying to will all sorts of bad rng into existence for you
truer words never spoken
good rng x2 to balance it out
its expensive to wish ill on the run
I have an arm chair behind me and Hikari is so cozy sleeping in it rn
is mario tripping in a fight rng?
dont thunderbolt the bullet bill KEKW
i forgot black was an original color lol
holy that chapter 1
gonna lay down with the stream, whether I fall asleep will remain to be seen
i woke up at 6am, thats not normal for me
normally I got to bed at 6am LUL
that means carpet clean %
ive done a run once, they did a showcase for bn 20th annivesary, and now today
i have no idea
terra asked me to commentate
I just ignored it
no one has any interest
i just did it as a proof of concept
i did it on english actually was a while bad
i finished a run, shared my splits "hey guys I did the thing"
"axl, we made a board so go ahead and submit it" i did it out of obligation
i feel so uncomfortable about that board
they always say "1 run is a challenge run,2 is a race, and 3 is a board"
also it was mostly blind with SS route
its cringe to watch too
if you saw the license fights
B license has magnet and ice panels
A license has lava and poison panels
so it is legit harder
but after A license the rest is cake
ice fights dont even change
all otherr script encounters change
like the triple beetank you saw komari one shot with dash
the becomes 2 beetank with howitzer int eh front row
dash goes thru howitzer so the beetanks are free
also null and void is easier cause no null and void
could you imagine 3 null and void with 330 HP with how they regin
honestly the hardest fight is mole
give you the pop up chip
in vanilla they have 10 HP and can only dmg them 1 HP per hit
in hard mode they have 15 HP
so have to use whirlpool or darkhole
they were going for the whack-a-mole gimmick
also when messing with the incomplete bn2 rando I got pop up on the tutorial, if one runs you have to do the fight over.
the 2ndround took me 45 minutes to complete OMEGALUL
if you get a script encounter and they run its free
if its in a gauntlet you have to start overr
i enjoyed the bn2 rando cause I know the game so well, but that only lasted for so long
i really liked the unique folder builds, like once I had a kunai folder. Super cool cause its more of a late game chip you never see.
bn2 was basically shuffle everything... bn3 on the other hand even changes dmg values
like ive seen a 20dmg varsword LMAO
they even change the name of the chips and navi/virus names. Seen an alphabug called KEKW
been thinking about how I want to do my splits
leaning toward enter fortress/runis/castle ect.
my old splits have some 3 minute splits and I hate that
yeah, I want to drop "prison break" too
yeah, my airman split is really short around 3 minutes but thats cause of doghouse.
if not for that it would be one split
you saw komari suffer in doghouse?
today was rough first fishy was like 4th encounter, I think 6 encounters to finish?
we took a break before starting mother comp, I told komari to run to doghouse and grind for dash * LUL
also hard mode started late cause runner overslept
you just 5 cap?
when isnt that in beginner route?
i guess 4 and 3 is easier
oh was wondering about a mid split for chapter4, gourmet guy fills that nicely
i think id split on last audio cue of him eating cake
ive seen some swap to bow in yellow house, dont know whats faster
i know jcog's old video guide said swap in the forest
im not the kinda guy to practice room but I might change my mind
but all the green
that same thing happened to me in last rando
i really need to learn LP blocks
i hear its impossible on switch
you carry the peril here from jr right?
oh duh! you just took dmg from him
is it not worth using turbo charge or do we not have enough FP for it?
if peach was smart once she got outside hit the blue switch and take the pipe to toad town LUL
everytime I see this part Im reminded of Jeny's clip lol
#clips for your viewing pleasure
i told komari about this...
I had a dream last night him and dalus rolled up at my house to pick me up for gdq LUL
even the life shroom?
whats the hidden blick then? a repel gel?
so weird not seeing exp dropped
i like it from the design side of punishing you from running, but honestly hate it
oh thats why you hate it LUL
can I just say... fuck that yellow fuzzy
"do what you did?" thats like saying "git gud, copy tas faker gamer"
checking in on hard mode to see where they are at
need to check my hard mode notes
almost 3 hours in and on A license
so not even cutman
fullfire, beetank2 and puffball, with a rockcube on each side is the last fight for A license, its soo bad
also bn2 hard mode is locked behind 10 secret chips which require pvp, and to get those both players need at least 3 title screen stars
thankfully wiiU patch fixed this
pvp was cool tho, there were so many randomly generated fields
oh no, his first visit to yum square he went to the correct warp panel last. This is a casual run with a timer on the gdq stage
and 2.4K people are watching this #socringe
they needed terra to do commentary cause no one else would.... almost like theres a reason for that LUL
komari finished his run before they finished A license, also gdq taking breaks doesnt help much
gl Phantom propokH /
i feel if a run is less than 3 hours it shouldnt need a break but thats me
is it weasle stomping day?
Hikari heard some thunder so she went into hiding
there was one yesterday
it completely missed here thankfully
we got light rain for 15 minutes
i messed with dk64 rando, not sure how I feel about it
I can see why this place can be terrible for rando with the amount of fetch quest required propokM
youd hate it for sure lmao
chapter 6 or the whole game?
id imagine id like chapter 6 cause less rooms to learn
yeah i see that
with my stick mash I hold controller with left hand and mash stick with side of middle on right hand
i wish bombette had stick mash LUL
I'm real bad at button mash...even worse with my worn thumbs :/
this game should be fun to learn :)
my button mash is so bad, the very reason I wont grind this game for top time
oh? didnt know that
Better lucky than good 4Head
okay, I've made a wrap/burrito and consumed it
also nice sneeze LUL
i know that feel
my ginger beer just explode onto my lap
once I PB'd with elec shield, I didnt split on gospel cause I didnt want it to PB LUL
random after this run?
what time is best for you on tue? I havent picked a time for mark yet
yeah, mark is streaming rn so ill hit him up later tonight
my friend recommended me zero sugar ginger beer after they brought to my attention that one bottle of regular gb is usually 90+% worth of daily sugar intake
phantom what is this mmbn2 run on gdq? it looks like a prank or something i dont get what they're doing
its a casual run on gdq stage
that's what it seems like
also phantom why'd you pick me out?
@Axl_Sensei are you for real
it looks like my first time playing but with "i have to beat it quikly" as my main goal
obvious they guy playing doesnt know bn2
thats what it is
did they make it to quickman yet
last I checked they were at cutman at 3 hours
"have you played bn before?" No
"do you know what bn is?" no
my blind hardmode run took 4:15
buff, make that a quote pls
and dont forget the PERFECT
finally a mod I can count on
I was gonna do a command
i wanna see phantombot say that LUL
or get TacoGuyy if I can't figure it out
@Tacoguyy your ass has been summoned
you said you submitted everything
im expecting you to do 6 runs there
phantom, viewership went up. There are 2.6K watching KEKW
PGB bragging about how good he is at BN LUL
is it bn2 or bn5?
terra even invited jameike on hard mode commentary and the man has NEVER touched bn2
considering the runner has no experience, I suppose it's appropriate
wait, right, you actually gotta play through Bowser's Castle
they cut the stream at shadowman and raided etchy
at that rate, they were gonna be there a WHILE
there was confusion, staff thought it was 4 hours but eta was 6 hours. 4 hours at shadowman is only half the run so I dont blame them
that's some slick movement
would you be interested in an actual hard mode speedrun?
so they just mery killed it? lol
oh? komari is going back to bn5
gonna jump over some questionable hitboxes are ya?
good times great oldies
the odds of 7 are hilariously low
do the quick kammy kill strat
"quick kammy kill" say that 3 times fast
did you get double 3 apped?
so whats bowser at now?
i haz cheese cake snack
peach wish harder!! phanto274BigRage
after this is a blind mmbn2 hard mode run
I can coach over VC
axl an hook you up
then full blind run, llets goo
ill do it blindfolded, only audio
real talk tho, I legit wanted to do a bn2 coaching with me only having audio
sends phantom clip "copy this rng manip"
bn6 rando? no way, get the fuck out!
would been fun with a rando
okay im done memeing
strimer, you forgot to split
unless you wanna do mine early?
i just sent mine over
thats what I intended
yeah just shop and key
im gonna have m4 do this too LUL
I have missed randl

How do I get him to ring my doorbell
i mean it was whatever I honestly was curious to see how long he would go
truly dedicated to the bit

Well they werent mean or anything
just so so very peculiar
yo his intro go crazy
kyle the ringer is in the belfry a bit of ringing up for the ringing up and pulling
thats what he wants his wrestling intro to be
realblopez: kyle the ringer is in the belfry a bit of ringing up for the ringing up and pulling
TacoGuyy: realblopez: kyle the ringer is in the belfry a bit of ringing up for the ringing up and pulling
the bot just got so much danker

I dont know if I could handle another encounter with that guy. again I ask... WHY ME
he hearted every comment
i don't know mitzi
@PerMitzi send him to me
good thing im retired from streaming
I will start streaming again for this man
pepeS i hope he has notification turned off
He also uploads videos of a british childrens show called big cook little cook
he wants you to ring the notification bell
yo "exploring new teletubby land in roblox" has 6.9k views
you can't NOPERS the funny number
that's banned in 5 states
your 5 favorite ones
solid, liquid, gas, plasma...? what's the fifth state???
Imagine having favorite states???wot
the 5th state is Ezekiel
please answer me a question
where did the name Ezekiel come from
I NEED TO KNOW
like, how did this become a thing LOL
God looked down and said "Holy fuck that bird is so round, that bitch is Ezekiel "
for some reason i thought your gf came up with it
BUFF00N WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT
but that also sounds like fake history
that's correct arie LOL
OH the LORE is CORRECT
@TacoGuyy I googled it
rip cheato said go to ch2
don't ask these questions. just be grateful for his gifts.
here's everything you'll need
streamer, looks like your enjoying my seed KEKW
HorseRide <- I like this
tried Strikers. it's decent. Refuse to purchase it until Daisy's arrives.
no daisy in strikers is criminal
As a Christian, I cannot condone this sacrilege
Buff00n is in fact my wholesome church friend according to a single white mom in illinois
Said white mom adores me
I peaked at the alt after combo breaker and I'm not gonna anymore
it is i think
race rules are a mystery
the rules are "no fun allowed" so probably banned
I hate fun
that bitch green as fuck
imo race rules should be "does it break logic?" "if yes, it's banned"
what if my logic is not liking fun
that requires me to know so much logic tho
I don't remember that one
you love to see it
after one I have to
hey, he earned that
phantomgamesbot is always here
why's the tree glowing
you schmooved on that guy
you run from shy guy he despawns?
what triggers the check for the mayor?
whats with all these fire flowers
how do they grow fire flowers in the snow covered land?
every check cant be god tier now
does that let your partners use focus? Never knew that was in this
i just got 3 cap jr in practice LOL
love having parakerry for this
a moment ago you were asking "what is this seed" look at you now
i think it should be, it only skips textboxes
an old spirit in burried ruins? makes sense to me Kappa
whats a hitbox? phanto274Shrug
felt like a good beginner seed
its fun to go nuts on LP
volcano has a bunch of checks too
put her back in the lamp
was waiting on that one LUL
Sad that we got the goomba
that shy guy tried so hard
im imagining general guy yelling at his troops for missing like that
just get lucky strats
1.41 to get a card oof
Toy Story 2 yeah LUL
super mega rusty lol
nice gl with that! I wanna try this randomizer eventually
gotta head out but have fun with the run!
of course! and you too! :)
blue key isnt required for chpater 7?
can finally get a hammer
I saw in rando discord someone had kooper in that mailbag check phanto274Facepalm
crazy how that was the first place it wanted you to go
having laki lets you skip bubble berry is nice
that looked like an erotic cake Kappa
Cley just finished and reviewed zelda 2
Just beat Zelda 2. the game was shit 0/100 I never want to touch shit fuck game ever again.
Bitch had rewind too
its fiiiiiiiine you have 17 life shrooms
Family really fixed the AC just to turn it off and never use it
it's like 80% humidity all week I just want to exist
this storeroom put me in go mode
this seed is "up and down and all around"
not too much, how's it going? haha all good, it's roopa
There's a zelda 2 defender in cleys mentions
i've been peepin for a minute, seems like a lot of "hm" moments LUL
i think the only partner i saw was bombette on rip
oh shit i didn't see para there too lol
this is the quickest I completed a seed so I wanted phantom to do it
there's no such thing as a "quick" seed
i have a hard time passing up the star stone check lol
oh! i had a mushroom so I swaped with life so they all matched LUL
My family safeguard weed for centuries. And now, I entrust you; Mario, to roll a fat blunt
the bat chose death
yo? almost enough for another rando seed
buff00n, how about I send this seed back in but just change the file name Kappa
damn, I tabbed out and missed crystal king
so my order was 1 4 5 6 7 2 and 3 last
9.1k points let's go
I have to go to bed within the hour, but you should be done by then
imagine if you skipped lantern and did that now Kappa
how can a ghost hit a physical object?
watch this be bubble berry
imagine not being able to headbonk the tree like a sigma
damn... 7BP power plus
what if this isnt it Kappa
moles never stood a chance
she used the graves of the mole to make the most fertile soil bawkSad
nice, you have no... mole... checks left KEKW
you did water stone tho
theres another water stone check?
omg the clutch lucky lol
almost half the time it took me, of course im not surprised
didnt know live splits did total play time
i just noticed something... the hud is purple and just so happened to match your layout
finally can put repelgjel to work
reminds me of mark's 10 cap fight
he one turned hallway bowser
this is why rando is fun
don't you only need more than 5 for turbo charge to be worth
jenysrPogslide jenysrPogslide jenysrPogslide GG
do it again but faster
YOUR MARRIAGE IS IN SHAMBLES
thanks for fulfilling my dumb request
SHE'S TAKING THE KIDS
Raid your local, your favorite people :)
funny how the only item you skipped was in the very first shop
I'm playing strive tomorrow
From the Hebrew name (Yechezqel) meaning "Round-ass bird", from the roots (chazaq) meaning "very" and ('el) meaning "fucking round". Ezekiel is a major prophet of Chapter 5, the author of the Kolorado letter. He lived in Yoshi Village until the babies wouldn't shut the fuck up, at which time he soared across the ocean.
Oh my gosh, did I make it to the start for once?
this Prologue looks different haha, I made an original joke
Too many voices in my skull. ;_;
The only command that matters is
dont tell toad but i blessed u and Axl, but not him
cuz he doent have that redeem
"Thanks for the good idea max burger taco" I have no idea what the captions are doing
we have good ideas, Taco
whats your favorite Pape speedrun?
i like ur controller input display its really clean
I should do a rando I haven't for a while
The updates looks really fun
Maybe I'll stream a coinsanity tonight just to see if I like streaming it
May as well stream something it's been 2 months lol
equip slow go coward
Honestly IS a useful one because if we post that for raiders then the view will count
looking back at my bracket from last night, that shit sucked lol
All those matchups are ASS
But I also chose to play millia so it's on me
But had Sol into Leo into Nago into Happy Chaos into Leo again into Sol into Leo again
Leo is generally accepted as the worst matchup for my character lol
why did they buff Leo in the first patch and why do I feel like they're going to do it again on the 10th
Ram is also not seen as highly in JP so she's on the table for buffs....
I already take 80% for one counterhit from her and her buttons beat all of mine I can't handle more
I'm just going to play ino if millia doesn't get fixed honestly lol
just give one of my specials a fraction of what they had
my issue with playing Solar is that he played Axl before Leo so he wasn't playing like a monkey and I genuinely couldn't kill Leo if he didn't kill himself
Patient leo is fucking horrifying
what if you had the power to harness electricity but then an italian bitch threw a coconut at you
Y'know I don't know why I expected anything else looking at I-no mods I just wanted to see if she had good recolor alts...
I blinked and you have all of the companions.
Jungle treasure frying pan inbound.
Refunded your shooting star.
But you already had all of the companions??? How could you possibly add another? Hacker.
He'll Para-carry you in the battle.
just 3-0'd a leo ama
i only know how to say the !speed language
i need a thing ik
i got to look at that on speedrun . com
rules: Timing starts when screen fades after you enter the dumpster. Timer stops when you hit the cutscene at the end where you go to the heart. Millenials ONLY.
world rec is 7 mins and 10sec
bc it glitchless it not for u phantom
i will go till i get paper mario...
that's too many daves
dave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave davedave dave dave
"oh god i fell, im yellow now"'
There have been like 4 more submissions since I put mine for MWSF
@TacoGuyy my worst surf fail '_'
Goth girl kammy Flushed
"Golf girl" according to your captions
there is only 1 unique one
"I probably should have ."
"I probably should have a."
how much fp is charge
dam that's almost a cracked bounce arsenal
let's go minigolfing at port
if there's a casino then jesse is 100% coming with
this is not marbles...
sad he leaves at 1hp so you can't watt tap him
"nice cloths call on the heart"
NO! Timecube.com is down now? RIP
almost typed !play agani
both of my mega shark sting... u got mega shark?
use mystery on bowser
that seed was ass to me lol
after I finished I did a bn2 run, actually got a 2nd prism from chip trader phanto274Hype
I kept top decking both of them LUL
what really hurt me was I got the fortress key in ch 7, game overd and forgot to go back for it
streamer, why does Lan rub his face against the wall?
nothing much just chilling after doing some work
that's cool hope the project turns out well!
yeah I get that. normally me with like yt vids and stuff
you want a date?
its on the table, doesnt mean ill actually do it lmao
You're now a founder on my channel since I've removed like 9 of them
you were 11th actually
because the first 3 subs were gifts
buff00n kept hitting you when he got drunk
so you had tier 3's at the start LUL
yea if I just keep removing people it just funnels in a list of earliest subbed people
Honestly just funneling it out to the people who are always there
It like JUST dropped
I sent you the tweet like 15 minutes ago lol
I'm gonna put my founder badge back on
wish it was just in the fucking badge menu and not a profile setting
why did they put it in the privacy tab
Debating on keeping brett on this list
I love brett but he's never there lol
he's resubbed like twice for me but I also just don't stream
or stream when he is
tryna think who else would replace him though
oh god I removed one and it reminded me of a specific person I didn't want to remember existed
fuck him up anyway
ok after that I guess it ran out of people to pull from? there is def still AT LEAST trusty and lange but it just gave up lol
there is 1 badge up for grabs LOL
I should remove jesse
you subbed and it gave it to trusty
why didn't it just already do that
I was like I fucking know there's at least like 3 more people to pick from here
@Ohrocks He's going to skip gourmet guy
I also did that last night but that's not important
I gave him the cake later
should I give a founder badge to "glizzytickle"
So don't do a run on tuesday
Ok my founders are my best friend of 13 years, Josh, a streamer friend, jesse, you, plant, ohrocks, buff00n, trusty, lange
All is good now
@Ohrocks congrats on the new shiny badge
you'll be looking better than a Wendys4for4
what shiny new badge?
the 1st badge I currently have but on my channel
oh cool... you just have it to me?
I'm not upset just dumb
yo? stray is getting a physical release
I'm gonna lurk and play the fire emblem demo
twitter seems to like it so far but it's also fire emblem twitter soooo
I havent played the base game yet
I wanna see for myself
I'm too lazy to swap shit for monitors so I'm just going to play off obs
they let me turn off random tutorial windows
everyone is fucking dead
good cinematic to start
oh yea I LZS jumped on jr last night after the chap 7 fight
ok I'm tired of obs I'm plugging the monitor in
It's still early but this game is actually holding a framerate so that's already way better than aoc
instead of items you get combat arts you can use a certain amount of times a map
they drain weapon durability which is just a meter for them
doesn't affect actual attacks
not what I expected lol
one thing I like so far
is you hit max speed absurdly fast so you can actually move around bosses
also byleth said 1 sentence and killed all my friends
im sur ehe had a good reason
now protag lady is angy
I have 2 sword now
why is jeralt alive I thought they shanked that bitch in like chapter 8
I died and now have obtained sothis 2: the boy one
the lever is a story trigger for G guy to be gone
He looks like ghirahim but naked
he talkin shit now how do I kill him
ok the weapon triangle is still here thank god
it's put as "class advantage" but it's practically the same
also now that I have the power of god and anime they gave me a command dash and I fucking zoom
They told me to use claude to kill a wyvern but I also have grounder sooo
gl with the No Major Sequence Breaks? | !discord !pb, Paper Mario is one of my favorite games :)
I couldn't remember the bot message so I had to improvise
is 3 Hopes just the new protag getting stabbed by Byleth everytime they meet?
I got shanked once and now I killed a buncha people
THE YOSHI KIDS SNUCK INTO THE JUNGLE ! ! ! "Oh no! Anyway!"
I've not had frame drops in the 2 battles I've done yet
Everything is an improvement over that
man do I want to do BL or GD first
I think I'm leaning blue lions just for felix shittalk
He is genuinely like my fav 3h character and everyone hates him lol
Literally everyone is at this camp except bernadetta
Dorothea said she said if she went she'd die to bandits in the forest so she's just not here
why are you 10 minutes ahead
Dedue wants to cook for me I'm going blue lions
Sylvain already wants to fuck me
not my fault the male protag had bad hair
It's the case with like literally every nintendo game
we're just at a camp with everyone so she just talked about people there
Yea doing those multiple times a day was like the only way to beat the black eagles route on maddening
because the route was short but scaled the same as others so you just had less levels
Still have 0 fucking clue why that route was that short when it's that unique
the church route is also just literally a worse golden deer one
I think it was something to do with the Empire already controlling a majority of the continent
It's the same exact narrative but you don't have claude
M4 just started my seed LUL
Church route should've had Rhea playable
it's basically her route
cant wait to see him do lanterrn ghost lmao
Church route should've HAD rhea
you literally don't see her until the last 2 chapters
she's in prison with bad lady so you literally never see her until the end
3 houses is a very flawed game unless you just play blue lions and stop
Then it's pretty good
THIS MOLE ISN'T A SAVORY FELLA
He's just a savory fella
I am a student now wowee
Jertiza is my teacher
This game looks way nicer than 3 houses
All the models have crisper animations and a bit more polish to the texture work
they're actually moving in 60 frames lol
wow they dont let me pick my dudes for the first house mission so I don't get felix
kronya and monica are separate now i guess
Hai hai. : D
damn we rolled vanilla ck color
@TacoGuyy Kronya killed Monica and stole her identity in Three Houses
"We're gonna beat Jeralt and his Ashen Demon, then WE'LL be the most well-known mercenaries of the land!" Oh, honey.
not that I'm complaining, but why did this game's anime powerup zoom into the mc's titties
So I'm currently able to use every house member on this map at once
so I guess the cap isn't 4 in this game
I def like that way more with the ordering mechanics
a little early but GG
and you can stills tack units
Wow, Shez is fuckin' stupid
you won't get demonetized if I swear in chat on YouTube, right
@buff00n you see what pape chats talk about and you think swearing is a concern
also phantom already says the fuck word
call phantom to distract him from doing stuff LUL
I saw your tweet obviously
pape pape pape BLANKIES
yeah I can relate
Oh man I get like that where I cant do anything when there is a plan and or im anticipating something happen
my peeve is... my father calls to ask for a favor, "okay sure fine" then he goes on "how was your day?" I hate filler convos so fucking much.
Id be like "if it's important they'll leave a voicemail" LUL
so where im at right now, I get home and drop my phone in the laundry room and dont touch it until I leave. Cant do that with the new job lol
texting is more efficient to relay information
phone calls are not
I hate having my phone now, after holding it for 3 minutes my carpal tunnel starts
leaving for work in like 2 seconds but gl and I will leave you on for channel point gains
speaker is a god send now
Good luck at work TacoGuyy!
break a leg taco
Ty I uh didn't really sleep
Was up until 6 working on shit and then took a 2 hour nap and got up to keep going
and now I have to go do manual labor YEP
I slept so much and my eyes were still hurting
so if I do stream today itll be pretty late
I stayed up until 4 am cause I am so good at not keeping a schedule BLANKIES especially while unemployed
I can not wait to sleep at normal hours again
I mean either I sleep too much or not enough
I go to sleep on whims, lay down and it just happens lol
I am well rested now that im unemployed Bedge
I sometimes take naps even after I get like 12 hours of sleep
cant stop the beast
oh no, I need enteral darkness to sleep
so I have a sleep mask LMAO
I have cycles where sometimes I need noise to fall asleep and then sometimes i dont.
The Office has put me to sleep a many times :3
it was very nice
I have put on youtube videos but im out in 5 minutes so whats the point?
The thing is I have to know I wont miss anything when I fall asleep. so I HAVE to watch something I've seen before or else itll keep me up
sometimes, like last night Ill leave on randoms stream... then he raids and the other stream is so loud it wakes me up FeelsBadMan
yeah I gravitate to people I know or at least the same category, not always the best idea
Last new guy I raided I kept showing off his alerts. They were nice but it was a bit much lol
bob ross raid OMEGALUL
I am fully comfortable just ending my stream and not hosting or raiding
i'll raid some restream of a marathon before someone new tbh
ill admit, raiding kinda does feel like an obligation to me. Just feels wrong not to, but totally understand why others dont.
that's how i feel too
I had raids turned off for a while. But people would just host me and come in and say "the raid thing wasnt working" Madge
1 whole year? that means phantom has to acknowledge you now KEKW
Boris we need more emotes like boris
Boris Post Boris This Boris boris Boris To Boris Post Boris This Boris boris Boris
Henry Post Henry This Henry henry Henry To Henry Post Henry This Henry henry
water the flesh prison peepoClap
i swear if its 321
one day I will be right and you will reset LUL
ill take vip over a sub
it would be cool if paper mario had multiplayer
save 100K points or get fuzzy right... which will come first...
how would that work
only thing I could think of is p2 would control the partner in over world and fights
like say if one was done at chapter 1 the other could just go start chapter 2
so the kirby amazing mirror approach?
that would be cool for rando
the bot has spoken phanto274Bless
thats what it means by 2
did you ever play megaman zero?
I have the collection on DS and legacy lol
its kinda weird for me, I didnt like X but really dig zero
Megaman X is fine, but dont care enough to play any others
Megaman 9 is my favorite one, played that the most
despite most saying its the hardest its the only classic one I finished without save states
pie jumps are like easy but also hard for some reason. easy in practice but AYO in a run no no no
i am not a fan of pie jumps
canon jumps are POOEY tho
still eyeing the ninja turtles collection...
Mitzi, have you seen it?
HOT TAKES BY PHANTOM
and i aint a good masher
I lose runs to the cannon room if I'm unlucky
I can sometimes max hurricane
my mash technique really aint too good lol
one of my adaptors has a turbo function fifiBad
power shock bowser is free
the way this game reads inputs is so annoying for mashes
power shock on things that aren't like ch8 jr or hallway would be way more consistent if the inputs were different
that would get me to run all bosses again lmao
every run i played of that category died to anti guys
9 years ago today megaman was revealed in smash bros... what I day that was...
not even being biased, it's so sick
yeah, that had a budget back then KEKW
so many cool references in it
the cloud trailer is carried by it being cloud's trailer
there's not much special to it lmao
link vs pit in palu reveal was lit tho
Pyra/Mythra trailer was also carried
the greninja one was pretty cool too iirc
in rosalina I was freaking out KIRBY IS IN MARIO KART lmao
but yeah not too many good ones lol
I think it was Wii Rainbow Road
joker taking over the game awards was genius
im on 0 hours :)
what about megaman vs sephiroth reveals?
calling byleth cool smh
i loved PoR, have RD but never started it
really like FE7, first one we got on GBA
only FE game ive played is 3 houses
Sora was good, didn't have a lot going for him other than the final character
was really hoping sora would have antiform as a comeback mechanic
sora trailer was more of a "finally they put him in" kinda thing
love how they jebaited everyone with dark souls
oh yeah got into hotfix
no cat left behind
wasn't expecting it ngl so we take those
I thought that was the category, like you had to get all the cats in bowserrs fury LMAO
but it was ok aside from that
how is the ru-
a koopa troopa moment
better than 3rd try i guess
3rd try is the real "i wanna go for speedy record dammit rowf"
COPIUM here ya go
So I watched my 3 year old 16 star pb and noticed that I split late
so my pb isnt actually a 17:09...it is 17:08 lmao
then why do you do it so much?
just find a vanilla rando seed
idk, ive heard you say more confusing stuff than that
one day i'll dust off my wii u and join you
yeah prologue is just so draining and chapter 1 isn't much better
after my few yesterday i had to just nope out, only so much i can take lol
fuck jr skip lmao
Prologue Prologue Prologue Prologue Prologue
i can forgive huff not being around for at least being mentioned a lot and having a real motive other than being one of bowser's chosen dudes
well none of them are dudettes (except maybe LP idk)
reading through sonic fans ripping each other to pieces over shaky 144p footage of Frontiers is bloody hilarious
Should've been a "not" Black Mage partner in this game
or whatever those dudes are called in this series
how is it going
what time do you think you are going to get
I'm sure you're going to do great
I am at the pool fifiHYPEE watching pape while I sun bathe
Thanks for the tracker legend. I've been so addicted to randos lately. Had to say some respects
Every damn time boss it's amazing
After a couple runs im starting to memorize my checks and I couldn't have done it with out the maptracker I didnt know about the 2 checks in forever forest for 20 years of playing this game lmfao
that must be the 'doogan dicking' i've heard so much about
now onward to chaper 2
what is your favorite paper mario game
sticker star is so good tho ;-;
my favorite is paper mario the thousand year door
yeah ss is my favorite followed by spm and then pm64
ss was my childhood sooo
likes cp but not ss ;-;
color splash is actually good tho
new pape games aren't bad oldheads just want more rpgs
ss is only rated low bc of the 3ds
and bc the level system tbh
anyone who says new pape is bad have never played actual bad games
ive done my time
i wish the new games were as ow as the old rpgs
they're both bad so either way
any tips for new wannabe runners?
run while u still can
im stuck playing on a wii rom
im practicing lzs rn ;-;
i have prologue down pat by now
what other speedrun did you do
mario kaizo sr ;)
will you ever do a kirby speedrun
i used to glitch hunt for ss
I love watching TASs
something about people breaking the game in half speaking to me
well we wouldnt have some mg without tas
tas stuff is really cool but i don't wanna watch a whole tas
just the cool parts
boos are one of my favorite mario enemies
i like mario plush forever
basically a mario acid trip
As much as I like tas's, watching people playing Kaizo is always a good time
imo kaizo is just a great demonstration of skill
people who speedrun Kaizos scare me as much as people who get good at Tetris
and how far you can really push it yk
more freedom in a rom hack than Mario Maker
I've seen some crazy shit programmed into Kaizo
mario maker kaizo has just more borders so less room for creativity
have you ever play paper mario master quest
eg, a shell that gives you invincibility when you hold it
coins that you stand on if you're not holding a key
a challenge can be fun when it's reasonable
if it's hard in a completely dickish way, I'm not interested
I'm doing a level 1 challenge on the thousand year door
Lunatic in Awakening's a good example. FUCK Lunatic.
I like the route for getting Peril
who came up with that?
finish the heart attack
new pb on wii tetris
why can ppl still follow you if they're banned
how have i not made a burner called girthmaddi yet
chapter 3 is done
who tf is that
so this is someone with nothing better to do, I see
how can jr troopa fly through
but watt is a good partner though
Watt's good, the problem is; this is a speedrun
we don't need "good' partners, we need "optimal" partners
I hope you know you're my timer for tanning. I'm switching sides every chapter
that's quite the tech
Imma be burnt lmao
on reflection, why are these toads in the toy box
they could've been friendly shy guys
I started tanning in chapter 1
Go fast so I don't get burnt Kappa
I'm too used to rando, was expecting Tast T. to give you syrup or something else
if you made a tire list for the paper mario 64 partners who would be the best for a speedrun
best pb for me
I'm good, eating ribs on my lunch break LUL
Leftovers from last night lol
Rib meat as a sandwich gerbieGasm
That sounds nice! Rice on the side?
Ohhh the fried egg nice touvh
you finished half of the game good job
Hell yeah over easy is the best
scrambled eggs with grilled cheese tho ;-;
just woke back up, dont remember where you were at last lol
what's your favorite food mine is pizza
I think mine would be chicken wings
i expected you to say ribs
The lemon pepper they have at wingstop is good
I like burger King
I like spicy but damn if it's too spicy I can't even enjoy the food cuz I'll be dying lol
@mx_four tell that to @PhantomGamesBot LUL
the yoshi's are gone
anyways, pizza with ranch>
we gonna see random strat?
you guys making me hungry brb
I just setup up some chicken to marinate
firsties are just bulshit
HELLA looking forward to that being delicious
speaking of food I had some popcorn a few hours ago
I think we can all agree on one thing
granparents cook > everything else
I sorry for your loss
no way I lived in alabama for like 3 years
My grandparents raised me lol
have you played bug fables
earlier we talking about megaman's reveal being today, apparently 3 years was also banjo
Bug Fables is in that position where I'm unfairly comparing it to the game it's based off of the entire time I watch
and it doesn't do well in the comparison
I treat "A Step From Eden" the same way
yeah, navicust is a big part too
combat and the sprite work for me, Eden doesn't look visually appealing enough to me
what do you think of black pit?
don't get me wrong, BN stories after 3 are WACK
but you can try to have a good/interesting story
its literal gauntlets, the one thing we hate most about bn LMAO
I like the remixes black pit did
I like when rougelike is a mode, and not the entire game
yeah, like in bn2 I hate 3rd scenario the most just because of A license
I don't like the maze either
I ran a poll in komaris stream about sky gauntlets once, the result was viewers didnt know about sky gauntlets LMAO
BN3: You want Hub.Batch? WELL, have fun with this 20 enemy gauntlet!
sick burn, gonna need 350 pokedollars for the burn heal
I like quiz part
We left the pool. Gonna get froyo now
Thanks I shall
the fuck is frozen yogurt
something I, personally, am not a fan of
ok y'all are wild
I never tried froyo
mitzi, the stream is saying you are wrong LUL
@PerMitzi mate, I've tried
On God, I've given FroYo numerous chances
Froyo is so good
each time, I threw it into the bin
@PerMitzi W H A T
just give me cheesecake
ILL EAT FROYO AND YOU CAN EAT GELATO
@PerMitzi I'll shake to that
It has been shook
Tho technically isnt cheesecake a pie
it didn't come up
It has a crust
was gonna make buffoon say " i love butts"
beat ya to it
im not on mobile but still blaming it
so there is a thing about hard mode
I'm a sucker for strawberry, or mixed berry cheesecake
my save is on vba, and im not going back to that, so it requires a 100% on bizhawk
the hud will speed it up but still needs effort
Battle Network NEEDS multiple save files
I don't wanna buy a whole 'nother cart just to do a separate playthrough
did you know that these motny moles have a weakness to hammer throw
would you really go back to the first file?
I ain't resetting that BN3 Blue 100% cart I have
@Axl_Sensei for netbattle, yeah
you 100% theres no reason to return to it
I ain't throwing all that work in th garbage
not in game like BN
I've a device that lets me play carts on PC and dump em as roms
you can do that on gbi?
will be doing a bn2 run tonight to try something new
something no one has ever tried
is it a run of bn2
what do you think of the amazy daisy
bn1, 2 and 6 are the games I haven't beat
you remember the kotobuki elevator?
I didn't realize there were 6 of those
coming back to bn1 seems like a MASSIVE step backwards
bn2 still has charm
In the Kotobuki apartment, when all but one floor has been unlocked, the cursor in the elevator menu behaves erratically under specific circumstances. When the bottom left option in the menu is selected, and the player presses Left on the D-pad, the rightmost option (Quit) should be selected. However, in the Japanese versions, the second-to-last option (i.e. the highest available floor) is selected instead.
that seems designed just to mess with speedrunners
this incredible song for an area you spend, like, 20 seconds in
so if I am reading that glitch right we can skip all of apartment comps
honestly the clear sky sun room is the best song in the game
I thought the "Sunny" Flower Fields played if you went back to the Sun
yeah so streaming under retro to not attract teambn LUL
brb, youtube'ing sunny sun song
yo imagine if the first time we ever did that was during komari's hot fix LMAO
WHY'S THIS A BOP
You no reason to revisit the Sun
I went back there casually to go see what the sun said and just sat there for an hour
then again, these are the same people who made TTYD's file select screen have a 4+ minute for a screen you spend less than 5 seconds on
I wonder if we are going to see a giant
I was assuming they'd remove the flag that triggered the sad music after the clouds go away
not add an entire another song to replace it
2 more chapters to go
he goes live at 2am my time lol
hello there bagged milk
I watched one hour
i had a streamer show it off on stream lol
you put the bag in a pitcher and cut a little corner off
thats hwo they do it
thats why I make fun of it
better than pouring said bag of milk
have you seen powdered milk? you add water
I'm still adding milk to hot chocolate mix
but I don't understand this what is so wrong with pouring the milk first before the cereal
phantom ive got a great clip you need to see
this man green screened himself into bn mugshot portrait LMAO
lookin' like a friggin' codec convo from Metal Gear
I love BN npcs
they have good designs
I thought it was really cool to see bn integrate different races
I threw the clip in general
if only phantom had a channel for clips Kappa
@Axl_Sensei YOU WANT SOME MAH DIS WHISKEY
did you see the jameike ones I shared in there
in my defense, I thought it was phantom-specific clips
do you play Friday night funkin
I listen to some of the music
b side game over theme is fire
I bought TMNT Shredder's Revenge and am waiting as patiently as possible
waiting on Sonic Origins as well
you could stream them
whether I'll actually play the game idk
but I do want to
I never booted up xeno 2
xc1 is very possibly my favorite game
I bought a friend the XC2 dlc and that fucker NEVER played it
its the thought that counts
XC1 has better character design as well, imo
Mythra's design is better with the leggings
I don't accept arguments on this
damn, those plants were chillin'
I bought one of my friends persona 5, if it never plays it fine. Just holding on to it is enough for me
I preferred pretty much everything from the first game over the second
in going to leave for a little bit
although the second was still great
@superkirby879 have a good evening, mate
thanks for stopping by
for someone, smart, he sounds stupid
so you're telling me his Smash win quote: "I can change the future!" isn't accurate to his character for a majority of the game????
very smart but also horrible with people
I havent played super far into xeno 1, I remember getting purge tho
no he CAN change the future
he just doesn't actually tell people about the future
just cuz can change the future doesn't mean he WILL change the future
he changes the future in fights
did literally anyone ever use sharla
if my big red sword told me someone I know/met is gonna die, I'd think it's probably important to let those people know
isn't optimal postgame like
Hell, even BYLETH tried to save their dad when they watched him die the first time
dunban fiora someone definitely
dunban is the highest dps
it's been like 6 years since I beat xc1
I remember my older bro getting XC1 on Wii. Our Wii decided to have that disc reading issue the INSTANT he popped XC in.
I know ng+ speedruns use dunban mainly
but then every other disc refused to read afterwards
simply don't get hit
if only the attacks in that game had a reasonable hitbox
cant wait to see the 4 hr run
I mainly played shulk casually
after this are you gonna do another run today?
if you do im def sticking around for it
THE KING IS DEAD
what's the blu spinny lined
I forgot dizzy attack was a badge
we are at the home stretch everyone it's chapter 8 time
it's not worth skipping unless you go for 4/4 cannon jumps
I can do it but it's super cringe
I won't go for it unless I need it lol, it doesn't even save that much
and even then you really don't need it but it's cool to know how to at least
oh right this part of the game exists
loved it so much I gifted it a sub lmao
will you play fall guys
so messing with bn stuff off stream, using the hud I jumped from tutorial to A license LUL
I can't wait to play it
free to pay, I think
Laying in the sun really saps you of your energy shoosh4Sleep Im in bed now and I might take a nap
I slpet so much today, will be ready to stream in a little bit
it's about 2:03 from fadeout entering quiz room
I think I got more vitamin d today than I have in the past 6 months
19 in the fight
save 2s on next split from partner swap ho
phanto274Hype I'm so hyped
70k tetris game ;-;
Is it worth it to go for more jumps in this first part? permitHmm
I'm positive Phantom would murder me if I did bad rng
if you do more than 4+3 he will heal in safe fight
I had gotten like 600+ bytes or whatever theyre called this stream
next stream imma binge spend them for ya
back when I started this time was top 10
im gonna spend 100k to get you to speedrun ss
I remember bluecrystal getting his time, was 10th place at the time
yeah, I ssw bn3 on the list lol
I will spend 200k points for that to happen
smrpg is a good game
`Oh I get back and you went fast
GG on pb though!
I'm 40K away from "Speedrun a new game"
how close is 15
I'd have bought that capture card from you if Glenn hadn't
@buff00n actual PC, first
start with goombario for a sub
Flinched when I hear Axl lol
@ElectricAxel as a "Brandon", I understand entirely
I never met this axl
Imagine having a second one of yourself
@Axl_Sensei I lurk a lot
I do actually know a second taco
totally didn't go to combo breaker with 2 tacoguys
Ive met axl_thunder and phantomaxl
@ElectricAxel yeah xD my rl name is also very common
yes chat therre is a phantom axl LUL
I would hope you've met phantomaxl that's your guys' son
taco I have a clip for you
dm me it this instant
gg all the way
how does random work
do we have traps?
forgot to ask for that
those who know OMEGALUL
Traps are really funny
Yo burger king did the classic
I got a custard concrete w/ cheesecake, pb cups and caramel
they put an onion ring in my fries
and it is TASTY
I hate it here
So its basicalkly just a 100% rng run
maybe you should start w/ Goombario more often
you started a new stream
I honestly like how the strive patch went
The tier list is pretty much the same order but the gap between chars is so much smaller it's crazy
I've watched you break those blocks a bunch, but I couldn't remember the order when taco was playing
He's the same spot lol
Faust got actual shit now though
just shows the economic status of the mushroom kingdom
Scarecrow mix has become the shit you were doing to me in xrd with the door
kooper has to sell himself for money
if kooper sold himself
who gets the money
the people he owes money
flower saver could be lit
he was selling money
I finished chapter 1 in like 25 minutes on the seed I did the other day cause they gave me a key right away and I started laki lol
Ok Ram is still doing ram shit they didn't really hit her besides the sword throw thing
gtg tune in later
I like the bots mindset
he just like me frfr
imagine me actually doing bn routing...
Mystery sol got 49th
is is a potential skip no one has done, also i does skip apartment comps sadly. I misunderstood it
he lost to "ARJAY!"
big d 3-0'd leon
Blacktwins already in losers
The N wasn't capital so I think it was bowser leon?
Oh yea that was lucina LOL
Big D is really fucking good
Doesn't big d like just have a life
He's just a GIGACHAD
The best lucina in eu :)
he'd do better if he swapped to Marth
jesse chag for top 24 winners qual
I pulled up a stream
and it was arbiter
I've not muted that fast in a hot minute
you were no longer audible
I just want game audio
He's EE without the dial
Although even full wilding EE will still be more chill than that because otherwise it loses its value
I've watched too many full drunk no filter EE streams
EE can catch himself, I've seen a stream or two where he almost said "motherfucker" but stopped short
That's a newer thing
He hasn't been allowed to get away with that habit for ult commentary so he's gotten really good about self bleeping lol
Especially for the extra nintendo gigs
Gimr wouldn't hire coney if he was still allowed to say what he wanted with tk LOL
Coney be saying some shit
Ludo got shit on in both ways by gluto
the whole set was battlefield
Wizzy kome is happening
how hard you think wizzy is gonna bitch about not whiff punishing after this
on his public or priv twitter?
the matchup isn't even as bad as wizzy says
It's a good wario matchup and mario has very similar tools movement and aerial wise he can weave through shit
yea you can get stuffed but your buttons are also god
and if he knew how to kill combo 
wizzy is just running in and swinging
he won't stop jumping and that's the only thing kome is swinging for
it's doable, but getting in is a pain
I forgot how much dancing blade sucked in Smash 4
wizzy just did run up nair up b
Rock climb with laki is cool
if you get on laki after you get on the first ledge for rock climb you just fall through the map and go up there
It's rad cause I literally can never do the 2nd jump YEP
Kome literally just sat at roll distance and waited for wizzy to mash at him and just ftilted him to end the set
Time to get ultra stoned DOUBLEWEED
"Heinrich hip ultrasound" thank you captions
all the time was wasted, couldnt get elevator glitch to do anything
i might be a v 1.1 glitch only and I use 1.0 for prism
so basically what it would do is let us skip the 2nd refights
when the fuck did kooper go there and why did he get spicy with it there
was it with kolorado Flushed
its not documented if jp 1.1 patches it or not. Just an assumption I always had
Esam is now playing the shulk that big d beat at genesis
big d beat him before losing to sisqui I think
Kels is top 32
was waiting for you to get it then mess it up KEKW
wheres the fun in opening the lock
I did shovel jump during my seed
it was very rad
seeing rumblings Banjo will be in microsofts show, but kirkhope says its not happening...
what's the star ghost gonna be
oop justice beat leon
25th for eu 
I missed the pb had to call a locksmith since my key broke on my apt door NotLikeThis lets gooo dude gratz!!
Very respectful placing bossman!
looking forward to actually watching smash at CEO
I thought about going but didnt know anyone else that was going
its a 3 hour drive for me
esam had a game 5 last hit and I can just see him sitting behind him watching baseball
is this frame perfect?
he has his priorities
I was getting a bit bored
big d riddles who you got
Bombette, I didn't know you had a sister
big d made a desync wall and then power geyser'd
that's really good hol up
he does nana blizzard popo up tilt when riddles goes for power dunk above stage cause it covers all drifts
he's playing this bitch like a puppet character how good are desync setups wtf
the other stream is pacman dark samus
riddles sdi'd a twitter combo and then dash attacked
he shot like straight behind ic's from blizzard
BOMBETTE DONT DRINK THAT
I said that name to Jibca and he immediately knew what it was
I just took a shot
I think he's been to combo breaker too much
XD hows it going? hows the rando so far? i found you on youtube thought id check ya out!
I'm uploading PB's when I start running again that shit is going incredible for you LOL
they are heaps good man usually just chuck one up before bed XD
I used to do twitch to sleep to but my usual degen streamers aren't currently streaming or streaming at that hour
Cause morph has a job now and Sway isn't streaming as much
Knives is already annoyed at me and buff00n from the groupchat so I can say that freely
that's a nice color for Kammy
we're both banned from knives' bathroom
larry got shit on
he died game 2 becase gluto held down during the back hit of up titl and fell out and ftilted him
oop jesse hit a run up fair
I hate that it works when he does it
cause he's patient the whole game and then he just says fuck you
He faired jesse going low and missed the cypher tech and died
Literally should've just daired
he was above him lol
yea chag is MAD jesse is just pressing now and it's working way too well lolll
he killed him in 30s lol
I mean you have boots and sushi so I'm pretty sure it wants you there by now
oh right I forgot you didn't get weight
man jesse is playing incredible right now
esam is playing mii brawler against sisqui....
Tea shows up on stream and all the kanji names in chat just say KAZUYA MISHIMA
Esam won game 1 on sbf then went pika for fd
Saving the yoshis has many reasons to why it sucks but the music leaving is so tragic
Tea went kazuya against tilde
tilde didn't ban fd
oh wait there's no bans
TEA DID ELECTRIC TO SUICIDE GRAB
japanese chat is just KAZUYA MISHIMA'ing even harder
welp esam lost to sisqui
his pika wasn't doing it after the brawler
Tilde is getting camped very hard by tea and it's really funny
peli vs shuton oh boy
lemme go to the bathroom now
Im not missing anything
hyows the rando going g
did you pb btw
YO WHAT AXL GIFTED ME A SUB WHILE I WAS IN A COMA phanto274Love
Thank you Axl phanto274Hype
What made this seed so bad?? phanto274Thonk
Chapter 3 has some goods ayo?
Find after find after find lmao
I'm curious to see what else there is
Chapter 3 was kinda loaded
Oh you can go to flower fields now too!
shy guys are so cute I can't
I wonder where the triangle stone is
you can beat 6 too cause we found the hidden dirt
I believe you found a letter for a boo too maybe they have the stone
People be giving you singular coins what is this lol
Seed said hold my beer
you could redeem it as a rando seed for ryan
I'd love to watch someone else suffer with this as well fifiHYPEE
I woke up right as we got the motherload chapter 3 checks
Watch gourmet guy actually have the stone
poor guy was stuffed in a block and couldnt deliver his letters
Oh ok hologram parakarry got it covered
I am scared to start randos
we have 2 park submissions its a good chance it gets in now thats neat
I live 20 mins away from the venue so i dont need any intricate planning at all hehe
wild how dog island got in LMAO
dog game go fast
forgot the bubble berry Kappa
did you learn your lesson from my seed?
mole fights had your poop
is this your 33rd rando?
remove power plus Kappa
do you have both damage dodges
look at this clip
wizzy is back to form
Where was the triangle
in one of the vines
also AXL! thanks for the gift sub
phantom picked goombario so I tossed some coins in his hat
sure but id require 2 sub for a goombario seed KEKW
then our race we started goombario and 1st check had kooper lol
actually starting goombario isnt that bad cause to game is forced to give you another partner
take a volt shroom for back up
twitter you had one job
its some battle network fan art but it has the pokemon trend tag
Any% runners should've just modded me in their chats to win lol
my strat works so well
youve been live for 9 and a hlaf hours
go for 10 bitch
I'm hungry for 30 more minutes of content
eat a life shroom then
you got enough to feed the homeless
up and away him
sees image of ps2 "first game you think of" first 3 games I thought of werent on PS2 so I went with sonic heroes OMEGALUL
ps2 was the worst version
he pinged me with that
How does the feed was me
I assume that was dodge master but still what's the 9 cap odds
m4 is doing fortnite but I have no runners on my list
thanks for the stream
I think rando is healthiest in small doses
Also the game is a bit louder than you
What's more powerful: pacepals or rando viewers
Simply stream under pokemon pinball
I mean mainline pokemon is just the same game each time
the only useful ones are like languages, challenge runs, and wr
When I streamed poke rando most views came from the challenge tab
that's been me for windwaker
And if you figure it out let me know please
At least pape people are cool and will lurk anyways
Well at least for the actual runners
After I finish this last bit of schoolwork and actually have time not spent to just this and work I'm gonna start ori 2 for real this time
Very much procrastinated this shit and it's why I've not slept the weekend I've just been doing it before and after work YEP
It was like the last couple weeks I just didn't do yet
I already finished history cause I just wanted that shit over with
It's so fucking boring
It was american history for this year and like
I don't care what terrible things the us has done let me exist I'm never using this and I've already shot it back out of my brain cause I dont care
That's been my mindset for like all of highschool tbh LOL
Like I'm doing well I just don't care at all
My mom can't even do basic math anymore so I live with an example of why this shit dont matter
She's a librarian she doesn't need anything besides the one thing she liked
Like i'd rather worry about shit when it actually matters for me
can you go fast?
Yea most of this shit is just there to teach me how to solve that sections problems and then I just don't need it ever again lol
Made it very easy to put this off in the first place cause I just didnt want to
anyways back to it I go weedMario
thas cause you're a nerd
Jesse is a bigger nerd
You're a cool nerd
He wants to count coins
I was tempted to post the pasta but I don't think I want the bot to have that
I don't want the bot to say "3' tall and 63.9 pounds to handle human dicks" in the wrong sentence
or any sentence honestly
what's traffic in Seattle like?
welp, we'll figure it out
bitch you live in illinois
live in the suburbs does not equate to driving in the city
just don't be a bitch
I'll toss you the keys
and tell you "don't be a bitch"
just get good at driving you two
I mean I won't be a bitch but you'll also not live long
I'm okay with these terms
phantom doesn't seem to object so let's die at port priority
just drive in a straight line and its easy
I'm 100% down for driving to that bakery
please tell me that bakery's still around
we can make a detour
it also depends when me n' TacoMann get there
and it depends on when we get a ride
no text box :)
I'm fine with that
what day you want us over?
I can do Wednesday
PP is Saturday and Sunday, according to my calendar
so we'd have Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I mean, I'm coming from midwest
so, if I leave around 10am, I'll prolly get to your area around 9 or 10am your time
I'm down for a good time
haha buffoon said PP
even with that bs and the fact i forgor'd 2 friends
i still was like a minute off
had to be like dugtrio
they made it get heccin meowth
my favorite part of the run, domestic abuse
fuck that guy, forget him anyway
go get dinner with glaceon instead
Become the homewrecker buff00n dreams of being
my brain is not functional
It didn't click I said the wrong one until you said that LOL
I've slept like 6 hours the past 3 days so I'm not taking blame for that
I named my mega blastoise blaziken
I also got a sandslash that I named poncho and I genuinely don't know why that was what came into my head when I caught that thing
But he has drizzle and thousand arrows
He tried to learn morning sun but like
My Conkeldurr has just been mashing acrobatics the whole game and the only thing that's lived is the arceus lol
TTYD in general is super fucking hard
Then you end with rng and difficult as shit
At least pg skip is really easy besides the roll clip
Just have to learn the texture
cavern is the globally least favorite zone by casuals
The playstation store listen tekken 2 at 10k
The best cases are all of us or all of you because even if I'm not in I will just win the smash bracket
lemme see if anyone else submitted a zelda lol
Yea when I typed zelda I saw that LOL
why are we beating up the gible
That person described both games as zelda
Gible has it coming
WHAT that's how you make friends???
Brady's pokepark desc starts with "You will play as pikachu." and idk why that feels threatening
pikachu really said be my friend or else
raichu took a hit for torchic
I subbed from both accounts :)
oh i already was subbed
its because of raichu Kappa
had to be documented
this games speedy spin?
that chase lasted like .01 seconds
my god pikachu really just kicks everyones asses
Nago's beyblade in strive is a disjoint too thas crazy
oh my god pikachu carrying things
"We wanna help you by fucking you over"
Golem loves straight objects
Yea he just really liked your work
no more straight things Gayge
what is this game
abras a freaking sniper
so where is the most time save
the map looks like a zelda dungeon
blastoise started with a lil spin
how would you even do that faster
wow pikachu really can just side step those attacks lmao
O there are so many nuances to the movement
That looks hard tho the camera and everything monkaS how much time is lost when it gets messed up
I like this game. Why have i never heard of it?
I had a wii phanto274Thonk
yo this a bop
omg the sign matches him
this is one of my fave pokemon
dont tell jumpluff to shut up its adorable papeHands
the loading screens are also lovely
the movement looks like it can be a bit finnicky
is there another way to move?
ok i like this game less now LUL
I am not a dpad gamer
literally a blimp of rayquaza
this is fall guys
whatever this pokemons name is i forget
KWAHZA is how i say it
the official pronunciation is whatever i read it as lmao
pikachu a gardener now
Bathroom break worthy cutscene at the END of a videogame? Heresy.
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
to be fair this probably wouldnt do too much damage to the world
it doesnt look that big of a sky island
the music is stressing me
it was ascending menacingly
That sucks so much ass
Item slides in lava are stupid hard. It only saves like 4 secs optimally haha
I just put some mozzarella cheese sticks in the oven. : D
I'm lactose intolerant D:
Thanks. ;_; They are so delicious though.
This is a strange Paper Mario rando.
No no, you're good. You've got this
start telling people to sub during your randos
Look at the camera after a chapter and say "sub bitch"
he may have record
But you have Boris
I'm goin to AS again this week
Taking jaemi with this time
gotta get 2 st cloud in top 8 this time
gonna be lurking. Gotta pack for a wisconsin dells trip with some friends
"Shaking master" You very well know the proper term is waggle warrior
Make sure you go to the bathroom as soon as the credits roll, even if you dont have to.
Me and brady at least already live here
So if we dont we can just be there anyway
Brady is closer than I am lol
Tbh I just hope they release the gamelist pretty quick so we can just book shit without worrying
Tas turtwig thats huge
I mean there is things to do in the city and a tournament happening for like every FG so it wouldn't be awful if we just went without many runs to be a part of
i dont need a hotel im so close lol
Cause they had like combo breaker numbers of brackets last year at 2dcon
Idk how well each one was ran but the smash one I've been told is usually good
My gold split tutorial is 2:17
Ive only ever gotten one
Yes left saves a sec
The more frontiers gameplay I see the more I feel like game is gonna be shit
It looks so slow and limited movement wise
Let sonic fucking run stop making him need fucking resource to do it
Sonic mania and heroes have been the only games ive enjoyed
People are so obsessed with Sonic but the games are so donkey ass
Sonic has a very terrible lineup of games compared to other franchises that have lasted this long
@TacoGuyy a hands-on said that there's a "action" setting and a "high-speed" setting in Frontiers. Most people opted for the "action" since they're getting a feel for it
Why make good gameplay a toggle
Because people don't know how to play Sonic games
SEGA DOESNT KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM
How do you even play sonic games
just fuckin go fast and jump around
Its just jump and run lol
Get from point A to point B as fast as possible with flashy shit and cool areas
Not rocks and grass and crawling without resource
Modern sonic has been trying to make the combat better each game but #1, they've failed horribly #2, who plays sonic for combat
If all of us get a game into midwwest speedfest that would be awesome
And i can totally see glenn getting park over me haha
They have a lot to choose from for me 
Brady if glenn gets in over you we will beat him up outside a perkins
gimme a game that's nothing but Daytime/Modern gameplay (ie Boost) the entire experience
If you get pape in I can commentate
This is really good so far phantom wow
ill just shut my mouth
yea you did this brady
The cheese sticks are delicious, by the way. : D Alas, I can hear my stomach going "Why are you like this? Who hurt you?"
It's fine. The stomach pains from my lactose intolerance still have nothing on my cramps. >:I
@VikiHexen why do you do this to yourself
Besides, I have a Nintendo Switch. I can go live in in the bathroom for four hours later. KEKWait
if i get in im gonna do torterra mid run to be funny
Dark souls boss of this game
I had a coworker who left early because they ate a truckload of cheese despite being lactose intolerant the night priot
Theres a cheeky lil tip that can save you loads of time
Spamming the camera button while turning makes your turns tighter. You just save more time for free
2 ways to kill your run in meeting place in a span of 2 mins lol
Quiz resets are the worst feeling
Krabby somehow is 4 legged
I'm a gold pal fuck you
wait gold digger is a better term
Imagine watching a sm64 runner and being a golddigger
I've watched so many sm64 runs from top players and I've seen them gold like 5 times
I saw slipperynip gold whomps a few months ago
You can get oddish on the way out from venusaurs
Hows beach zone going im done packing now
How do you like the speedrun though are you regretting it yet
No dont grab lumber before cutscene
Im glad to hear that though
I skip my splits when i move off route so my sum of best is mostly correct
I skip if i get treecko
my new route skips teddi in favor of burmy. It loses 2 secs but its consistent
isn't burmy in the treehouse
If i get a red berry in tutorial then i replace ursaring with burmy instead
thems fighting herds is on sale phantom should I grab it
did you talk to the static one?
So hypothetically speaking, if phantom beats glenns time does that mean glenn is going to have to return to any%
Wii park has fog inside cavern zone but wii u doesnt
No. I mean you stand at the rails and look at dugtrio and theres fog in the air there. Thats the only spot and its weird and makes no sense
Its hard to explain but wii u and wii feel different like the wii version is just grittier and more grungy
Wait there isnt fog on yours wtf
Maybe its a jp thing cause on jp theres a shit ton of fog i swear im not bananas
Does this pb have 2 irons
we want gold right
Yeah its fucking nuts
Theres a line on the ground right that i use
Its a big line though not some random ass pixel lol
Rhyperiors is a cool concept atleast though
But haunted is overall my favorite zone. Design wise, the pokemon, almost no rng, funny jokes, great zone
WR is 2:18!? :O by brady oh my we got royalty
I've met brady in person so does that make me famous by association
well i havent so brady is royalty to me :)
Oh course you like haunted zone dusknoir is there
Quiz lost you a good 40 damn thats rough
A lot of movement mistakes in ww can lose me a minute+ or the run
Which is why I'm absurdly conservative compared to alberto with the hard shit loll
Missing an item pick up loses like 3 secs its absurd
I don't feel like losing the run to save 3 seconds
pikachu is fucking dead
Jp quizzes are brutal
Y'know what we gotta do
get that shit away
Lost a 2 minute jp pb to porygon z quiz. One of the quiz answers werent in the document and i got it twice so i lost every ounce of time save
oh shit my b
Pokemon runners are very very dumb
I love this minigame
Wait what about easier languages what lol
pOKEMON ALSO HAS ICONS FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING
and dialogue is fucking yes or no
Thats kinda ridiculous lol
I've never played windwaker in english for runs it's really really not hard
I just learned my menu text for things
Ah yes cause theres an objective fun
BITCH WINDWAKER HAS MENU BASED GLITCHES
And our damn menus don't have icons it's just the damn text
or just dont get confused dumbass
guess what spanish word that is :)
how could you tell that's for confusion
wanna know what paralyze is in spanish
it's very hard to tell :)
Pokepark is literally just based
The one good pokemon community lol
we just want our funny little pikachu game to go fast
English is faster than all the ofher pal languages ironically
Mismagius has become one of my fav pokemon lately
Psr discord is harder to listen to than twitter
don't you like them making a category for a single trick at the end of the run
Imagine having a leaderboard split for puppet ganon skip
If they said that
I would run in spanish and submit
Since I've never been there I would just show up
I kind of want to now
Then tell them to fuck off because it's dumb
So they get someone refusing to run because of their dumb board lol
i just got into an hour long argument in the multi mario server over a new src rules NotLikeThis
they allowed you to cut out a game in a longer run to be able to submit for 2
like you can take out your galaxy game in order to submit for say sandbox
TA instead of RTA basically
oh im in favor btw
yee imagine doing a 1962 and being able to cut out BF and can submit for 1862 if your race order is differenty
the bot agrees with glenn
well i had to deal with 3 hardheads that just kept saying the same dumb shit about it ruining the "integrity of the leaderbaord"
they started going after mods too it was real dumb
its a positive but they were too busy not reading what the rule said
thats def what one person interpreted the rule to be
no they just couldnt read
there's currently a poll and its 45-5 in favor
he's def one of the most known
the best is odme CoolCat
when we hang out at midfest does that mean im a well known multi mario runner fourthgenBLUSH
@Glennjaamin nope you still not famous
kinda spoopy if ask me
i did 1 602
so im built different
he's a top sunshine runner
honestly sunshine is now not my worst mario game
galaxy 2 is way worse
Galaxy 2 is just bad
I main fighting games but I fucking hate the smash people so I don't
I'ma start streaming strive if I get it to run smooth with obs
Should prolly try that again now that I fixed the drivers
honestly id love to be a park mod
I would submit a park 1 run if he got mod just to make him watch it
I'd shittalk him the whole time
The 3DW community still hasnt put me on the cat ext board CoolCat
m4 is my favorite
you dont mod a community right phantom?
Youll love rhyperiors attraction during all friends tomorrow phantom
you doing all friends tm?
when you thinking of starting the run?
Practice attractions beforehand honestly
random% is kicking my ass
i need a break
i died 8 times td in 7-4
and i wanted to go fast
Spamming camera will also make you go up the treehouse stairs faster
ima probs submit park all friends to RRLAT one day
really really long a thon
Imagine trying to commentate during attraction grinding
remember it aint all of psr just switch psr
they the dumb dumbs
oh yeah its a lot of the same 3ds community but the 3ds community is actually good
@Bradybooo pikachus buddy buddy adventure
josh setup a whole 3ds pokemon speedrunning contest
and oras fixed their shit ending time
it was post credits fight to brendan, now its hall of fame
Star rod just feels better to split at
it has the music to it too
thats how josh felt about the oras fight
There's a reason people mainly say gg at starrod
the run is over lol
person ahead of glenn washed
wait what if it's my turn
we can just leap frog up to brady
do it i aint gonna run any% seriously for a while
I may do one for fun but like if I was gonna actually run park I'd do 2
i wanna learn ORAS atm
I wanna commit to ori after I finish this last bit of shit
Good shit, going to bed gn
look at pulse if you wanna learn firered
there's manipless and manip
make sure to tag me
@Glennjaamin I think it's good that he died
Mine has 490 views get on my level Phantom
I'm telling you its forbidden time save
hand written notes lets go!
did you makes these notes?
what drew you to this?
been thinking about stream schedule stuff, will be nice to actually keep up with that. Just need to see what nights the new job leaves open
with my days off changing every 2 weeks I just couldnt commit and didnt want to change it every 2 weeks
with bn being a shorter game I was able to do more attempts vs something like pape
Is this a mixed dex then?
oh I learned something recently you might find interesting
so in pape the seeds are called fushiginatane or "mysterious seed"
I knew I heard that name somewhere before....
Bulbasaur's name is fushigidane or "isnt it weird?" But know I know wherre the pun came from LUL
I wanna see you win this race with regigigigas
but his ability slow start Kappa
he did his best
also found all the your partners first attacks are name after them. EX Shell Toss would be Kooper Attack.
But Bombette's name is "Pinky" so her Body Slam is literally "Pinky Attack" which I find uncontrollably funny.
gotta friend them all :D
not much just resting
is it a random pikachu?
Hello phanto274Lurk Im waiting to get my hair cut
like you playing as
And then I have to go grocery shopping permitDead I hate doing errands
Haircuts scare me. I love my hair
good luck on friendship
If I were this pikachu I would just accept death cause no way Im making that many friends lmao
id give up immediately bc my limbs are too stubby
Buy followers, primes and viewers on mystrm .store

falls in water "hey let's be friends"
oh no, Jugoomba is taking bn2 next... goodbye my top 3 spot
after that he will have WR in all 6 games axlsenS
no cause I forget to eat food
food just slips my mind 100% of the time I be on Twitch
the times are so close, so why is pokemon split between US and JPN?
the not getting along parrt
I enjoy a good phantom shitting on psr stream
Vaporeon is a Pokmon in this game?
someone call the quiz king?!
why is wingull on the GROUND
You just beat a grandma
If your uphill of him, he'll land faster
well fuck, there goes my productivity. Pokemon twitch channel is streaming gen 3 anime LUL
They just met Mr. Stone of the Devon Corp
Sends out Crawdaunt, Chat: BIG MEATY CLAWS!!
I love watch dumb shit with chat
are you running on emulator or on console?
can you run the game on emulator? cause I remember the game having alot of wiimote stuff
rule #1 blame glenn
my route would have you stop by Taco Bell and get a Baja Blast before starting the timer
Why the category shift?
That Scizor is dark as hell. What did they do to my boy???
You use other Pokemon in this run?! Holy.
Could you theoretically Pikachu only this run?
Do you get more than two health blips on Pikachu in this run? Or is that still just not a thing?
I'd consider what just happened as Hitmonslaughter.
xD Your speech to text for that was hilarious. It picked it up as "Hitman, slaughter." Like you're giving a command to a Pokemon.
So, like, I'm not the only one here that understands that Pikachu is just bullying everyone else into being his friend, right?
Is that Goofy's voice actor playing Torkoal? xD
You can't unhear it now, can you? Haha.
i am eating for the first time today. I got some sushi
to be fair i woke up like 4 hours ago
idk its like a party platter
I made hamburger helper. : D
party of 1 platter
ohhhh a french dip
quilava turns into a roly poly
my god he's throwing a fit
can you stop shittin fire OMEGALUL
the slow mo makes them recoiling from the attack so much funnier
caught in the crossfire my guy
we all need a little shock here and there
just a lil sting
yo my haircut didnt go too bad. Tho she cut off like an inch and a half clintB muh length
But does Lightning Strike twice in the same spot?
fucker got hit a few times Kappa
pikachu is literally perpetually concussed
someone get this poor pokemon in a dark room with no stimulation so their brain can heal
no time for friends when you're concussed smh
why do you need gold?
D: hitmontop a gold digger
THEN WHY YOU DO HAVE TO DO IT???
hitmontop exploiting you for free labor
1/5? we've done like 7
with those guys wanting to mess you up
now waddle back WOW this is wild
I wouldnt do this for a friend OMEGALUL
WHAT KIND OF FRIEND WOULD DO TAHT

i just recommedn letting them come to you
so just dont move
I myself found my old copy of pokepark and im 100%ing it before learning the run and im in eternal attraction purgatory :)
flying pokemon are awesome in this game Keepo
rude to burmy NotLikeThis
Just think, you're only like.. half way there. : D
hit lever -> go to ttar -> absol shit
make more friends slowass
wtf this man is 5 minutes behind my pb
why was that so close
waggle warriors dont need arm health
i found my old copy of pokepark wii :)
you know what tha means
Why did they design lopunny like this and expect nothing bad to come of it
I added this earlier cause plup had it lolll
I have join the poking parking discard phanto274Smile
Look at chikorita go
The bean boy bookin it
it's trying its best
time to get the only wr that matters
Magikarp on Empoleon's Snow Slide
honestly suprised they didnt allow magikarp to do every attraction as a joke
he has a lot of them
why cant magikarp do Aqua Dash tho LUL
cause we alrewady have slowpoke
brb learning how to mod pokepark to somehow allow magikarp to do alll attractions
wym im perfectly sane
Knives put her traits in akinator and got kokichi from dr3....
I'm scared to see who pops up if I put my traits in
Akinator will just say "Some bitch"
Each time I've dyed my hair I've done more and more red should I just do full red at this point
Yea I'll prolly just go full red at somepoint before doubledown
Maybe after I'll make the fade black instead to go with it
you're right, i have no idea
i've only seen pokepark 2 all friends before lol
that in terms of pokepark friends
vaporeon is the most cool
(that's a lie furret is in this game, sorry vaporeon)
yeah furret's only other appearances than the absol game are hide-and-seek and it can be seen in the meeting place
it do be a long lad
Tropius got a buff00n dumpy
That reminds me knives has not said a single thing in our group chat since I posted a weed mario
failing or hitting play again by accident
this is for LatiasCheck
smh what a bad turn 1
thats not #1 Kappa
Someone in coneys chat didn't know wht a blowjob was and he banned them
TacoGuyy ruined my favorite Water-type
Ohrocks ruined it for me
Why'd you bring me in????
Why'd he bring me in
I've done nothing to you to warrant this curse
look there's been a lot of nights where you made me sit in smash training room for 5 hours
I could've been gaming
I didn't have mods then
Slowpoke is so talented
Coney is teaching me that I should never trust any woman's affection it's a trap
aw hell nah pikachu got the disjointed hitbox
yo the 4k shot
RareChar RareChar RareChar RareChar
Chikorita is so talented
Hey bud, been watching your paper Mario randos on YouTube. Good stuff :)
Ngl that was the length of a wanna become famous and I was about to reactionary ban LOL
The :) saved them LUL
how much longer do we have for this run
Anyways, good luck with closing out the run! I'm gonna go shank the locals (in DBD).
Anyways, good luck with closing out the run! I'm gonna go shank the locals
Nomura said in an interview that he was pickier with sora in smash than disney was and why are people surprised
He didn't know how it would "affect the plot"
so he genuinely does think every time sora shows up it's canon LOL
Kingdom hearts in general is a fucking mess
I remember that fucker from pixelmon
I open twitter and see adhd explaining how ganondorfs nose is better than his dick for sexual purposes and I'm going to leave my computer now I think
"Go for the huge shnozz, the ganon jr looks feral and is underwhelming"
Is hitmonlee a shoto
brb have fun making friends 
make all the friends already
Long stream long stream
It was fun, making some progress on KH3
how youve been buddy tyronLove
I'm busy, but alright
no need to say that
I'm debating on if I wanna stream something
I grabbed tacos and horchata with my cousin, so I was lurking
now do it again
at least you arent playing park 2
i goofed in 8-6 and then died a lot in 404
Let it get to me? I'm just gonna creep, Down in Pumpkin Hill I gotz to find my lost piece.I know that it's here, I sense it in my feet, The great Emerald's power allows me to feel. I can't see a thing but it's around somewhere, I gotta hold my head, I have no fear. It probably seems crazy, crazy, a graveyard theory
guess who just woke up?
Hikari just came in
hiding under some stuff
there is thunder outside
know what's awesome about doing rando with mitzi?
letting her find goombario LUL
question about your tracker
how does it know how to update based on seed number?
did you know the mayor magically wakes up to accept a letter from you and parakarry the first time you talk to him and then passes out again :)
if you have his letter and parakarry out
MOTHER FUCKER WOKE UP AND I WAS SO CONFUESD
yeah mitzi, phantom always does that lmao
mitzi, are your pupper afraid of thunder?
uh we dont get much so im not sure tbh
it's like Lan rubbing his face against the wall lol
we had 3 red koopas
OH BABY A TRIPLE
yesterday in another seed I did Posie gave me a pebble out of her tree. Like oh yes. this pebble is so beautiful thank you
ive been relying on quake hammer for my seed. only costs 1 FP
I understand the rando hype now.
freaking chomps ruining the fun
i like the color of these chomps
AYO the water rock
I converted Mitzi permitWow
watching one of my friends play bn6 casually. He has a beast gate and is slotting in chips. He just used the Bass Gigachip lmao
bro i need the weight im suffering
my seed is poopoo
oh, your playing a seed?
super casually like not going fast or nothing lol
I started with kooper
ive got erryone but sushie
where is the fish dammit
i like doing slow checks
like.. kill goomba king? say less
my dictionary was behind pit
when people give me mushrooms at checks....
a part of my soul dies
KOOPER why did you have Tayce T.'s FRYING PAN
has there ever been a big check beind anti guy?
what were the signs? clintT
anti guy had a coconut for me lets gooo
he really said "I will guard this coconut with my life"
Watt had the WEIGHT
pulse stone was in the library boxes. I almost skipped that phanto274Smile
I literally would have just quit cause i for sure wouldnt of found it lmao
500 points away from another rando seed
yeah when I redeemed the one I was at 55K
which one are you gonna give him axl :3
dont know... he hated the last one OMEGALUL
are you torturing him with bad seeds lmao?
do you wanna try it LUL
im still looking for the damn fish
funny how we never found the odd key
oh phantom, yesterday I send mitzi the seed and she booted up a completely different seed LUL
listen i never said i was smart
I get the full Mitzi experience
I wanna hear gamesbot say that quote
also speaking of gamesbot
ive seen a few games I own, like No More Heroes
oh well I guess you gotta play em fast npw
the bot demands it
I was like level 12ish?
since yesterday seed wasnt used on my rando splits im running live splits for 6 hours to add it to my total play time
oh no, found something we will never agree on LUL
so in bn4 all dark chips are null meaning metal soul can charge them for double dmg with max HP dropping
can one shot aquamanOmega with just darklance doing 1800 dmg
people are subtweeting nintendo xenoblade tweets, so hard to avoid it
phantom starts stream just as I wake up lets gooo peepoClap
yo! you streaming under retro too LMAO
mitzi, you need to get around to playing one of these one day
The only megaman I ever played was the one you could kick the can
I wont be here but id say the parasol cutscene
im acttually about to shower and get ready for work
that child already had a receding hairline
i gotta let the doggos out brb
hope you enjoy the condensed alphabet soup
it hurts so much i cant stick around for this sun-baked hot gargage
also crosses are not shuffled sadly
okay im legit sad I cant stick around for this
thas him on my screen
Someone on twitter popped off for me for beating jaemi and I was like "We've had like 30 bracket sets and he's my practice partner"
Idk how people don't know this he's literally the only person I'm with at these events LOL
Also it's like the most even sets possible at this point every time is last game last hit cause like
He's the player I know best at this point
But yea I won a game 3 last hit by running up to him and harding reading an empty jump with waft at 50
TacoGuyy your color reminds me oh a popsicle
is that a good thing
I opened 7tv and it was on your tab so I saw the emote approval notif lol
Oh yea last night someone was talking about how EWGF in Tekken is an unsafe high risk/reward move but like
The only point of doing electric in tekken
is to make it +
It doesn't add to combos lol
as long as you have recov10s
People just want any excuse to bitch about kazuya in smash but if you bring up tekken mechanics at least make sure you know how it works...
Komari, Im counting on you for clips. Ill be leaving in a few axlsenRip
just get null chips and you're good COPIUM
@Axl_Sensei shit, I'm actually gonna do BN5 soon
The retro category exists for older games that dont necessarily have a following? clintT
watching GMD resets Kappa
I use retro to hide from trez
bblstar is pretty cool
Oh so its a way to hide too
little boiler doing work AYO
People on twitter are now saying that Xenoblade and FE are causing us to not get new games people "actually want" :)
what kind of logic is that clintT
It'd be crazy if nintendo like had different studios making different games
That'd be unheard of it's all nintendo :)
People are also saying why don't they just outsource IP's to get new games for things and like
DO THEY NOT LOOK AT WHO MAKES ANYTHING
I wish natsume would make good harvest moon games again clintB
Who needs those when RF is thriving
The OG harvest moon devs stuck to that after the dark age of HM started
it's good you can charge it COPIUM
Game was even called fantasy harvest moon for the first 3 LUL
yo saved 2m lesgoooo
I know. But like... I want harvest moon. not Rune Factory.
phantom, just look at all the fun youre having now
I mean yeah Rune Factory is good. But im simple. I dont wanna fight. I just wanna farm
now when the dab patch?
I've mainly liked RF more because I always just feel like the characters get more expanded upon since the stories typically get more fleshed out
Cause the combat is just pretty standard ARPG
Well they COULD have done that with harvest moon I feel. they just chose not to clintB and then RF happened
I am a non violent farmer
Yea the dungeon crawling being your progression I guess could be annoying if you don't want it but the farming dating sim is still def there
I personally ADORE Harvest Moon: Magical Melody
That's the only HM I currently own physically
story progression is important. Id rather not have to fight to get more story. I think that's my only issue
Thank goodness they got rid of the runey system. I hated that in RF frontier
Oh runeys were just there to pad shit
Frontier was ABSURDLY rushed
That game had a like 1 year dev time
The wii RF games are weird cause you either love them or you hate them
If Tides had farming I'd like it significantly more because it easily has to best ARPG aspects of the series
Frontier was my first RF game. I liked it until I didnt.
okay dipping out for real, GL
My first was 4
Then I played 3 and Raven existed and that's when the series was for me
I played HM for so long before RF I just am a diehard HM fan
I have an unopened 4 copy on my desk
I played A Wondeful Life, Another Wonderful Life, Mineral Town, More Friends in Mineral Town, Magical Melody, and a couple more
talk to mom and enter toilet
i just had breakfast :3 egg and bacon sandwich and some sunny d
i like making screwdrivers with sunny d
sounds like you need to do gregsp to get used to BN6 again
it's a good run
you can say you just forgot a wiggle
there's a good video tutorial for that movement
Neon white is rad as fuck so far
It's the platformer fps that got shown again the other day at whatever
With the devil people
Oop a buff00n character just showed up
Tall, red hair, gonna beat the shit outta me
how the fuck are you not done Kappa
sub 4 colonel axlsenS
naturally you'll blame sky g
I plan on watching in the morning when no one streams
you wanna do this again?
so it'll be a casual gregarious fight
I tried changing the title lmao
we take those W
how did trnarrw go?
prof is too good for us
well sure, it's no hackjack
nothing on the outside smh
I thought you were a gamer
did youbsee what I shared in music?
I can't get used to hearing Axl so often lol
where have you been LUL
It's not something to apologize for
I'm pretty vocal here
true, but when I am here...
chat, he feel for it!
bugs were such a cool concept
OH BABY A DOUBLE
have you been watching komari?
nah don't be a casual
hurry my lunch is about over
I will EAT a Fright Jar if this run doesn't get goombario. I will crack the lid with my teeth and suck out all of that sweet fright juice. Then, I'll insert the jar in my mouth and begin crunching. Once it has been reduced to several sharp chunks, I will unleash it into my unsuspecting stomach. After that, it's up to my doctor.
fuck his first message was a sub I can't ban him for that
Almost a year, thats crazy
I am genuinely considering just speedrunning neon white after I finish it
A game with mechanics I've loved to death and I've yet to even dislike a level
I've never had a movement game this crisp where it actually had levels I liked 100% of the time
The resource management with how fast you go and good times requires precise ass aiming it's just so fun
Cause your weapons are cards you pick up and they have sub abilities that remove the card entirely but help you move faster or break a barrier
Yea the game encourages you to find the optimal paths
And they made multiple ways to do a level
There's also gifts you collect that you can get after getting at least a silver medal on that level that're really fun to get
Most have made me find a way to smuggle my cards around to keep the most amount of abilities I can to reach them
After I 100% the game I'm def gonna at least do IL's for a bit
Yea a lot of the fast strats are very input intensive but also feels and looks very good
Like that last thing I tweeted took an hour of learning those flicks and I still was like a second off the wr
At least the FPS muscle memory helps with the flick part LUL
holy crap a coconut in a COCONUT tree
burn that tree down this instant
is it a missed sword? MissedASword
I want to get more emotes but I also need money for flights and tournaments
don't buy kooper he's evil
she's holding the turtle hostage
kooper was imprisoned there for public indecency
Kooper was put in prison so I'd believe that
Whats the rules for the extreme shuffle?
using your timer for cake LUL
Jesse has to play shuton into dabuz tomorrow lmaooo
But yea other than gameplay Neon white has a cool concept
Jist of the plot is you're dead people who got sent to hell and you're brought to heaven to compete for a chance to stay there for a year by helping them clear out demons
Fuzzy stole koopers money LMAO
I really need to work on my colonel counters axlsenWut
when it goes good tho its such a clean fight
literally gives you a penny to do his job smh
I mean that's probably his own whole salary
Would make sense why he didn't give a shit and lost every letter
I had a really strong gut feeling about that one LOL
D: that pebble is for bowser
The one seed I did I got caught by a slow go trap
I am the only person who would be affected by that
No more Kooper nudes for free you gotta pay now
What would koopers name on OF be
Hey youtube viewers, comment below what you think koopers onlyfans name is
ok now make the title good so I get answers to that question
little flower dude just in the forest playin with they train
sub or die plupGun
click the funny red button
maybe the little bell too if you're feelin goofy
honestly if I want to watch a vod Ill just embed it in discord so no ads
the twitch stream that is
oh course if im subbed ill just watch it on the channel
I watch a lot of people and with how many tourneys I watch it's worth it
Cause FGC majors run on like 15 different twitches at once
xrd bracket I have on the other monitor just got a jam on screen
can things in shops be traps?
am sick in bed
please come end me
I was gonna say... spend 30 coins on a bomb :) i would be big mad
@permitzi I thought that "okay, good" was aimed at me for a sec
you may not like froyo but i would not wish sickness upon you because of that
so the ravens are called kyu-chan, prob named after the sound they make and raphael is called Big Kyu-chan LUL
Man Johnny looks mad annoying to fight but he's so cool to watch
I wanna play it
random question: bn5 colonel makes more sense as the "canonical" version than team Protoman, right
win some, lose some
thats right, if you play protoman you wont know colonel in 6
also falzar is the canon version due to tomahawk having unique lines to say to colonel
Megaman/Lan meet Colonel and Baryl for a cutscene apiece in ProtoMan, that's no where near enough time to recognize Baryl's in BN6 when he talks to Lan/Chaud
Baryl LITERALLY shows up after the final boss and Lan's like, "?
"I'm Baryl" oh okay. cool
who needs the pyramid stones when mario can just be stoned weedMario
Jam is back on my screen and I already want her gone why is she so loud
was megabomb worth getting for LP?
okay this shit made me laugh
mega rush is called "dangerous and powerful" LMAO
goombario been workin out!!
now we get the good cutscene
thanks game... got 3 capped on KP phase 2
just got seed from colorado and notice I forgot the one in forever forest lol
it's an official speedrun strat though
It's time for bloons gaming
I have like 300 hours in 6
he could have sushi up his ass
That's not an autograph that shit is just a graph
merlin is super fan!!!
ive never done that check cause i always forget it
and i think my body wants me to go to sleep
bro i was legit yawning playing pape tonight
its not just an axl thing/
you are dying irl this run if this keeps up
you need sushie for bowser castle
i want a money tree
is that allowed in glitchless?
i was like WAIT what
oh yeah got sub 1:40 random% td
isnt swimming on water tyronShock
Damn, missed most of the run. Lol
Lucky with the shocks Pog
learned that deflecting shit with my sword gives me a speedboost on top of killing things
Also learned there's a medal past the last one it actually rewards you for so I'm uh getting these now
Didn't even show it existing I didn't know it was there until I grinded that one level with the shotgun lol
So if you see red medals by the level select that means that person is a gamer
its 12:14 rn wym
My grandma chugged a Baja Blast
she loves it and is literally the only soda she finishes
I don't understand why tho
it's a Rando Randy sNeed
haven't used sNeed in a hot minute
go get a victory Baja Blast
lmao im so awkward thank god for joey
1:41:59 was like my pb 4 days ago so i bopped that easily
i was shocked it wasnt like a 1:43
the break made it feel a lot longer than it was
I finally memorized the forest
I saw dodge master
I had Henry sell storeroom key, pretty funny
fp is maybe good
couldn't you just take sushi in tunnels to ch 5?
oh you don't have bombette
That makes sense. Hopefully you get an early ultra stone
never thought of you to be the type to do challenge runs
5fp spiny surge? Oof
so it's a cursed seed
Hows the rando going
Whelp then its not going bad so thats good
make up the rules as we go LUL
And a 1fp power shock? Seed does not want you to use laki
Oh god youre clippying on him? God I love rando
Him being a trap is a mood
Can I as a maybe helpful question?
Did you check the ch5 shop?
I noticed the title and was curious
ahh yes clippy I have no idea how to do your trick
but you look like hell
oh im talking the trick XD
not you, you look fine XD
u going to double down right
Hello hello how goes the laki rando?
I was doing some glitchless rubs and was 3 minutes ahead and threw to final again lmao ended 8 seconds red phanto274Smile
Hella good run tho up until that @permitzi
Know! Hello permit7 yeah it was sick until it wasnt lmao
Naw it was like 12 hours ago
when is ir next big tourney
Haha right? Ive been sleeping so it has felt even shorter to me
when is port priority
Well that just sounds poorly planned
Could use some work
Thats probably the best potato ever
I love that jammin jelly and ultra shrooms are the money makers. I get hype when I see one lol
I had to go to goomba king to get boos portrait in one of my randos permitH
Was not the vibe
Just hit the block monkaS
Hitting blocks can be spooky tho clintCry
My boyfriend is making spaghetti shoosh4Cozy pasta pasta pasta
Im so hype for spaghetti I dont think you understand phanto274Hype
Salad and sandwiches sound tasty
I also have pasta
Oh Im gonna make an Ezekiel plushie
With my plushie making skills
Right? When can I order my Ezekiel?
Time to open an Etsy shop Kappa
But for real I actually do like making plushies and have been getting an itch to make paper Mario plushies
Ive made a shiny driftloon plushie for my boyfriend. It turned out amazing. So I can def make some paper Mario plushies
Bow would be so easy
do you have a picture of the drifloon
Oo doing the 7 partners would be a sweet collections
Yeah! One sec. I would def wanna make all the partners
I have a shitton of pokemon plushies I needa see this
The 2 things I bought from combo breaker were a controller and a giant ass chikorita
at least its not parakarry wanting to give letters
mine was in the tree you hit four times after junior
I have a picture but no means to share It with you tacoguyy :)
I just woke up
I can do that
That looks so good!
YEAH right? No tutorial or anything
a plushie is a project
that was one of the first plushies i made with no pattern :3
i also made a majoras mask plushie
I might be mass producing ezekiels clintT could be in the works if i get off my lazy butt LUL
you can laki clip through the white wall part i thought clintT
like the same way you clip for fast flood
i think I saw that somewhere lol
yay best guy getting his cake
right best guy not living up to his names T_T
You don't have a based goomba companion to let you see for lantern ghost
I am the worst when it comes to marking things off the tracker. especially keys
lakilester giving you a snuggle
thats literally what it looked like
i wonder where cheeky lil parakarry is
maybe hes in the store phanto274Lurk I always forget to check it after I beat a star
the amount of times ive gone into desperation mode cause i forget to check that place SMH
chapter 1 kinda giving good stuff?
nope the game said THUNDER LUL
ok you saw that too
PerMitzi: nope the g
a 7 coin coupon
i could never leave it

this chapter's a mess
i see you obtained the trophy weight
it's not too late to turn around
there are people who care about you
yeah, i also got up like right away to get ready for bed ahaha
i prob woulda missed it anyway
spear guys are 70%, fuzzies are 75%, spike top 60%
a dink of all time
so that's how you do that
get into the pyramid without raisin' it up
Weed from the Flower Fields? You KNOW that's the good shit!
how is this laki only don't you need other partners for stuff
kooper has a twin
midnight and this fool still ain't done LUL
ain't midnight in his area
goombario only is like the buster only of pape KEKW
glad to see fight was worth
what do you need?
goom on deep nuts
auto corrected goom to derp
from the sounds of it, you don't wanna clear this seed
g9d I hat3 mobile
you have everything for 7?
phantom gets his just desserts
time to dip have fun gamer
I really should play smash before advantage state this time but like I dont wanna play wifi
But I lost because of input fuckups in both sets last time and it's a simple fix ughhh
Why cant bamco just make good online a single time
instead of playing Smash for Warp Zone, I've been playing Mario Kart for SNS
mega smash laki bowser
laki is fucking dead
what a way for laki to go out
and nobody is sad
GOODBYE, THIS GODAWFUL SEED

gl on the runs today
wanna see the ones I've made for him?
he has three emote artists
whomOk whomVwheel whomBall whomSip whomGG whomABall
i also made his channel points annnnddd alllll of his overlays
theres also holiday versions of those emotes
whomSip is my favorite holiday version
it has a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows and some steam coming off
he normally would stream a lot more in the summer but he got an internship this summer
honestly. this would be how i do snowslide whomDerp
ive taken and still am on a speedrunning break
the only streams I've done recently are art commissions ones
like the one imma do later
i have a clip of a mawhile that made deathline (the main mod at the time) just sigh and ask how
i never really got bad ma's to be honest
though my last run of any%, a race, i got SO MANY GOLD NUGGYS IN A ROW
it was a race against Rob for his series race, and he joked to say im going to get nugs since i was ahead
i got i think 4 or 5 nugs in a row
he felt so bad after the third
after the fifth. i really didn't wanna do the run anymore
and like i dont run with splits
splits give me too much anxiety
my last pb, my splits crashed. i only knew what time i got was because I was in a race with rob and furi and won so they told me
and in said run, i also was fixing whoms poke tracker for series race whomDerp
i really shouldn't have been able to pb
i would have to see
but you can do different colors on the one he uses
as long as you talk to balloon friend
i havent seen many lets go runs to be honest
i know some of the stuff
whats item sliding whomDerp
it depends on which item sliding it is
the one in meadows WASTES time
some of beach does save
this one is hit or miss
i think all item sliding is stupid
but who am i to talk
i refused to do a "faster" route because im determined to beat a certain person's time
and also i struggle to double dash
both the speed boost and the game
im bad at mario kart
yeah doesn't work for me
many people have tried to teach
it just doesn't work with my brain
whoms tried to teach me the visual cue, especially in person
i just can't gcjDed
i don't need a top time in this game. I've made me mark plently enough
park is just fun to randomly run
park 2 any% not fun. park 2 all friends is apparently where it's at
i was originally offered to be a park 2 mod, but i declined it since i never ran the game
i literally just had this convo with Mr Shasta the other day whomLUL " as a speedrun the first is more fun. as casual, the second is more fun. you dont really need to know nor play the first to understand the second"
the game is fun
if you actually want to know. the ONLY reason i even Speedrun Park 1 in the first place was a bet i had with Cheez. If i did a single run of Park 1, he would play park 2 casually
and cheez had fun playing park 2
i had a similar bet with whom
If i did a single PMD BRT run, he would play my favorite game, Okami, casually
this minigame is a nightmare
you couldve just ended the sentence there
pretty sure everyone does
I've had to redo several pokes before
just be happy you played all friends after it has become what it is today. running the game back when it was called hundo was a lot worse gcjDed
true hundo is a whole other beast
Hundo required every single pokemon in every attraction. that includes your legendaries
meaning you need to 99,999 metagross
and hit nearly every ring for Latias. you could only miss ONE SINGLE RAINBOW RING
i dont remember what i struggled for Latios. but both Latis gave me hella trouble
it's honestly because of me and whom that all friends is what it is
we ran hundo for about 3/4 weeks in a row on fridays
and slowly finding new things that we could remove
there was others. like Cheez, and Rob, and eve. lagging who joined
but it was always me and whom
All friends was the reason i got to affiliate in the first place. whom and cheez would finished before me and then raid me whomLUL
i know most people followed me for park
HA we do art now
when i feel like doing park, i do see an increase of people
i dont stream at all consistent
i take long breaks
I've gone months ope cinder23Oof
my main game is park, i try to learn okami on and off for years but life~
i was going to speedrun a game i backed on Kickstarter but.......i dont like the community
i don't like what they decided to do
they love me even though i cant get a run really going
Id say if you do really wanna do okami, okami is a.HUGE big hearted community
we even made a second discord called discount okami where it's us friends just hanging out and being goofy
whom never joined the og PSR discord because of a similar reason
i currently have am okami emote to do
hello fellow okami art enjoyer
theres an art event so ive just been lurking
we talking bout dogy?
life has just been in my way
i was going to learn again this summer but i got a ton of commissions and once i finish this last one, I'm closing them down because im taking a google certification class
I'm going to be a UX designer
i need to do comms too but i want to get personal stuff done ;-;
i already have my bachelor's of Graphic Design
UX is just the next step up
but makes 20-30k more base pay
and given I'm moving to Cali next year... yeah
i need that 20-30k more
ive been meaning to do some full landscape pieces this summer, i have a sketch of one for okami
my non artist friends sometimes get tired from me whomLUL
i forgot rotom sounded like that
why doesnt' it just go brrbrbrbr
furret is silly fren
that's a lot more hops than needed whomThink
you can dash onto those and hop up
yeah it's easier that way
you also don't need to hop the last platform for mews. you can just dash across
aka the platform right across mew
but yeah. in granite zone, those platforms you can dash hop. dash to those that are risen and then hop after
honestly just cry for togekiss
whom and i were able to do it as 2p1c
this game is interesting as 2p1c
I lost to steve and terry, def wifi
I think the mu is fine, I actually just got outplayed
whom did D-pad, B button, a button, and -. i did home, +, 1, 2
it's been a hot minute
not as complicated as you think
treehouse movement is dumb
i feel like you would know
Pikachu isnt good at any attra
Im talking about my bad engrish
Oh lord he comin
that's all I need to know
back after getting a +3 on my stash of Blast
I love hamtaro KPOPheart
why was that the master sword
What should I name this tapu fini
It's now named idk
Better than last time
last time I had to name something burp
I think it wants you to do chapter 2
Yo that star piece
yo this tapu fini
they also have a base 130 fairy move I think comes from the gear thing
but that's not as good
whatever the gear mythical's name is
Oh I have a pure power exploud as well
y'know my team would be really good if mega blastoise didn't get crit

Malort has a special place in my liver

I'm sending that to buff00n
so why did buff00n say, "soon"?
I have no fucking clue
he's been at work all day
Oh its not good. Dont get me wrong
Buff00n said "Ah, a man of culture"
I think buff00n misunderstood the screencap
DUDE THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
JESSE HAS REJECTED ALCOHOL
*insert image of Thanos with the text, "What was he cooking?"*
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT SHIT ASS
Cheer10 did someone say malort

if it's so easy why did that fight take 2 and a half hours LUL
I have a huge power pyroar in my pc
missing a seed? have you checked https://pm64randomizer.com/
It can't learn shit though
pyroar is one of those pokemon that i totally forgot existed until literally right now
It is a lame ass pokemon
I forget lovdisc exists
luvdisc is for heartscales only
that got rid of that in Gen 7
alomomomoolol is for terroizing lower tiers of singles
i can't unsee it
Every time I see them I think of jcog saying "What if they had nipples"
i'm trying to think of other pokemon that i forget about, but i couldn't come up with any :)
don't spend it all at one place
@starry_arie every Gen 8 mon ever
Centiskorch is great tho
i don't even remember the starters
oh now i remember them
Rillaboom fucks people a different way
I don't know them by the names
VGC people got PTSD

phantom speaking different language
some people think it looks very good pepeW

Oh yeah. I fell asleep before she finished chapter 4 phanto274Smile i was a sleepy gorl
squirrel and moose bawkGasm

okay doesnt look like anyone is doing pools rn long as a catch the main events
finals are during the pape race. want to enter but not sure anymore
im done working sundays so you cant blame me for being excited about that
yeah, If I wanted to race I had to call in lol
yo? this man just try to hit a flying enemy with a hammer?! that is pape 101
Hello! How's the rando going?
Looks like it just got even better with that Mega Rush XD
And hes in the floor
Y'know I was gonna do the usual with pallos but he had a based message
we don't talk about goombario
Slippi is banned from pandas chat and people are mad
Why are you planning on downgrading your hp?
Almost like supporting pirating a game from the company you're working with is bad
"WOO MELEE GOOD NINTENDO BAD" -random twitch chat drone
So if you're at 1 HP you just become an unstoppable force
I was gonna buy and play FEW today but Idk if I particularly want to spend 60 rn
I just muted the # and I'm gonna wait
The power of the wario alt
A lovely chat message from plups chat "@plup can you unblock me on twitter im sorry for sending you farmer porn FeelsBadMan "
And yes I am mostly posting this here for the bot to pickup "I'm sorry for sending you farmer porn"
I'm disappointed his chat just hit the Analyze on that instead of copy pasta'ing it
he still has it but now it's at 20
@TacoGuyy I... Uh... What?
Man just liked some farmer porn and wanted to share it with his fav player
oh no bow has lost her's colours
I missed an interesting conversation while I went to get supper.
tbh thats pretty normal from top smash players chats
what happens if you don't use bow ability?
if you don't have bow mario just stands there
oh that's nice of from the game
That didnt hot the clubba?
Flushed hot clubba's in your area
So gourmet guy just needs some dirty talk to get on with it NOTED
Lemme send that to ohrocks
you don't need it?
oh I didn't hear that last part
this is fine, someone would've said it anyway :)
It's a hot topic
I hope it stops being straight forward, it is pride month afterall
fish goes in the ground
it's what they do
You about to got through the floor are you?
Oh no just land swimming my fav
this is normal fish behavior
swiming on the ground very normal
Damn bro you got the whole squad
Why is bombette the only one without a recolor
So far DBFZ players seem to be having a lot more fun at CEO since they banned labcoat
Games are faster and more team variety
Cause you remember the fucking 5 chars we saw at combo breaker LOL
I just hope this next patch destroys lab coat
That is a genuine problem char cause literally EVERYONE swapped to her in the team comp it wasn't a choice
Im guessing that there is still a lot of fusions and reg 21
Meanwhile Yonni lost to random hero from minnesota in pools with his broken top tier that needs to be banned tacogu1Sip
Yeah ssj4 can fuzzy you in a game that removed them lol
@TacoGuyy Wait I just saw this wut
Yea derpdog is a hero/steve player from MN lolll
he's the biggest shitter
I played him once, lost 2 games to steve, then shit on him in a reverse 3-0
How does a bomb kiss you
Yea some chars deserve it
Ult is not at that point
But steve is lame and I want him banned
Nobody dropping mains to play these fucks and they've one like 2 things without Leo lol
But yea I don't see steve ever fully taking over because the best players in the world play the swordies that beat steve lol
Yeah steve kinda gets fucked by the meta
Hes just better gnw
Punish game is stupid but also like that shit is frame perfect I feel like they deserve it if they hit it in bracket even if it's dumb
not the jab stuff tho
that stuff can go
It's snake levels of learning curve for matchup but it's def easier for steve to MU check it
What chars do you got where you are?
Wdym you have 4 bowser jr's why don't you want that
That's something I like about our current PR, the only low tier bitch is lucky
Your CB bracket was actually fucked
That was a jesse bracket
Was it like steve falco?
the 2 worst snake matchups
what do you do
ZSS before nerf was the only MU I was going to counterpick for wario
Its like zss is still top 5 or something
Now I can at least play oos game and poke her better
it would be cool if paper mario had new game plus :3
Even then I will likely try seph if it's bad
oo the best alt for CK
nice cap to save the turn lol
I was gonna stream but Idk if I really wanna rn
Cause the load at work was 6 hours late so I did the whole thing alone while closing
so Im not alive fully
we be going down the mountain today
block this and I'll gift a sub
STOP THEY ARE CHILDREN
Man let him playyyyyyyy
MARIO SAID FUCK THEM KIDS
HES GETTING WOBBLED IN HIS FAVORITE GAME
i would love a sub :3
if phantom didn't hate children you coulda got one
Yea I knew there was one in that room but I forgot which tree it was vanilla lol
i will get a sub one day
if he gets goombario that is also a sub
I just remembered that tomorrow is gonna suck for the wrong reasons
I don't like "for the wrong reasons" in that sentence
Last ep of love live is tomorrow and Im dreading LMAO
i need that sub!
one in my life i will let you get goombario
Also I was seeing that one of the upseted players was actually banned
But I think they are both mid
That man has brainwash-I mean convinced me
is there a way to see where parthners are?
Only if he gave someone the log
Also I play brawler so now so I believe him more
And by play I mean conuterpick him on yoshis
My yoshis char is falco
No just in general
Falco genuinely plays the game better on yoshis besides the plats so it works better than most peoples marios
I use brawler against zss because he does better than rosa and incin\
I don't mind it but my practice partner is falco so
Im happy that lylat is legal at the panda cup
In my game 5 set with zubat on wednesday (current 6th for the state) we just didn't ban and stayed ps2 and it saved so much fucking time
Cause it was sheik wario neither of us really wanted to go anywhere else
Im getting more accustomed to just going ps2 for every set
It just feels right
Unless they dont ban yosh's
Jaemi doesn't start PS2 because I've won literally 90% of our bracket games on it
Thats a cute plant
Yes I mean lilly
And he usually bans it in the regular bans
Oh I didnt know that
if it's 2 bans he just removes SV and he has never let me go to kalos a single time in my life
Dude the sonic player keeps letting me go to kalos
and I am very fine with it
Wario literally never fucking dies in that MU on that stage
and I just wait for waft
goml's stagelist is so good
come on goombario where are you
What if lacky is in your chosen partner when that cutscene activates
DoubleDown is doing crewbattles between NA, Mexico, EU, and JP
How hard will mexico win
I think NA gets last, EU is weaker but NA has sucked in literally every damn crewbattle ever
and game over for him
To the point of TK being an advocate for stopping NA being the main crewbattle candidate lolll
where to next phantom?
Did buff00n dm you about mwsf btw
He's thinking about driving up
He's figuring out work rn but he wants to
so I'm gonna wait to pay you for the room until we know if he's coming lol
cause that like cuts a bit out
I already have dibs on the couch/chair thing so Im fine
The nice thing if he does tho
We'll have a car
And there is portillos up there
we could also hit the friday local if the game schedule allows depending on what you and glenn get
I'm surprised with how many double ups they gave players
list of the games?
I have a link 1 sec
wait that's a page
Like I'll gladly not have to play WW but surprised they didn't accept a zelda and accepted those lol
Neopets is gonna be lit
how are they doing amy in sonic mania?
I love 2D sonic, im playing it right now LUL
well gl i will go play with a friend
they did this same shit with sonic 06
Frontiers is gonna be ASS
the only good game sonic was in was smash ultimate LUL
he killed a master hand in subspace that was rad
I picked a time to tune in
oh buff00n I mentioned your maybe coming to midwestspeedfest
just let us know as soon as you can about if work lets you or not
I'll send that thread to you one sec
they fixed colors so I feel like this will get fixed eventually
It's the last thing phantom sent me so I have it right there lol
Sega continues to rush Sonic out the door despite DECADES of evidence saying they shouldn't
open source game engine LUL
that's the only aspect of sonics speed they understand
So a joker player in MN said steve was so easy to win with that a baby could do it and now he's playing steve today
and he losing to 0-2 metaknight
at least fans will patch the PC version
Oop he swapped to joker
I played him a few weeks ago
I shit on him very badly
Considering how much positive buzz is around Sonic due to the movies, it's incredible how quickly Sega's moving to stomp out all that goodwill
I hit a raw fsmash just because I understood
TWO fx badges? blessed seed phanto274Bless
His joker got 2 stocked
Also was informed this is the same MK player from "the incident"
I need to find this clip it's very important
god who fucking posted the clip I dont remember
where was pulse stone?
smash pools are over, pandacup had them
what does repel gel taste like?
at least he tips, I guess
I can't figure out who posted the clip
they didn't name drop in the tweet itself either so searching is a pain
it'd MK, was it Bear?
did you say "taste like dicks?" Kappa
you know damn well I don't keep up with Smash shit
also, it's "MK", that means either "Mario Kart" or "Mortal Kombat" in my noggin
Phantom, tell TacoGuyy to stop being mean to me
Grown ass man can't handle me shittalking him
Took 100 bucks from him with falco he hasn't recovered
I got mitzi to agree to coach/backseat for my first glitchless run. Just have to find a date LUL
Ok I found the clip of the incident but it's an edited repost
gonna be so much fun
I'll dm it to you for after stream, that's the MK that the joker lost to LUL
what ETA for the marathon run?
ooo apologyman made it to top 96 at ceo with faust
The char is actually a character now
Scarecrow actually functions as a teleport mix option now like door did
that jump is so ridiculous that it works lol
Scarecrow prc throw is absurdly hard to deal with
I'm glad I'm millia and just fly away
i think i saw you do laki jump with it too right?
oh that clippy thing?
Oh now it's time to watch pplant megaman
yeah there's things i feel like i'm not at skill level yet, that's definitely one of them LUL
MAKE SURE HE'S REAL
before I rng gift who want

I don't appreciate the goombario diss but yw
goombario is beautiful and perfect

phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES

IM HERE FOR A POKEPARK STREAM PogChamp
Yeah I tied WR last night so I'm trying to break the tie LUL
But hows your stream been?
Yeah idk if they're gonna compare miliseconds so
I'm think I'll just save up for VIP LUL
So what were you doing before this?
Oh yeah quick side thing, have you thought stuff you've wanted to test for dog island... I'm making a list of stuff to try whenever I go back to the game
Yeah I've been think about some ideas. Also maybe testing things on PS2 since I have that on emu
Yeah the conditionals for the game seem pretty strict
There's no way to tell them apart expect talking LMAOOO
Oh yeah have you ever like experienced lag on any version of dog island?
Wow that's nuts LUL
Wait when does timer for dog island usually start?
Oh that changed too? Interesting
I knew about the ending
but not the starting one
I am so sad
are the loads different on each version or not really?
I had to leave a stray cat alone on my walk and I might have started balling lol
I wonder what they would be if you like did USB loader thru homebrew
Im gonna go back for him tomorrow morning
probably not allowed tho
Ok good to know
I've been thinking about it, I was talking about stuff with a viewer and got me interested again
I hated that chase as a kid
I'm gonna head out now gl with the run
huff is a rager
yeah ima do a lot
do you have enough timesave here to pb?
Electrode already shaves off half
Oh wait you are in granite nvm lol
don't talk to electrode
Yeah you can kinda just buffer every input
hey corsay guess what
that isnt the game you are playing wym
NOW you are understanding yhe struggle
Yeah the movement has been pretty solid it definitely wouldve golded
Youll be saving a good like 20 secs all around though when you get consistent at double dash
Your mashing and menuing is getting really good
Random question real quick
do you know the language versions in dog island
I'm just looking thru some files and I'm finding interesting things
There are appearently six different languages
but whats weird is i got these files from NTSC
also there are two files called home button?
there is french, german, italian, netherlands, and spain
Yeah thats what I'm just doing lol
phantom rq its 15 friends out of meadow right
yeah im counting autos
yeah im preparing notes and learning the route over time
real men throw on mew chase for the catJAM
MEWMEWMEW MEWMEWMEW MEWMEWMEW MEWMEWMEW

YO ive been up since like 4 am. I might be on a sorta normal sleep schedule now
everyone in phantoms chat MUST be subbed
just a couple days more and i'll go full cycle back to normal sleep scedule
cats4eWiggle cats has some really cute ones
tho i do sleep for like 13 hours a day
it's really a toss up
hi it's been awhile
cats4eWiggle Axl has allowed me to wiggle now
cool emote wish i could use it
Mitzi is my wiggle buddy cats4eWiggle
coincidentally I am also doing a Rando Randy sNeed in Pokmon Platinum... just need to figure out how I want the catch rate to be
ok im gonna go be horizontal now. For how long? I have no idea but I shall be a lurkin Bedge
oh phantom, there were 2 people to race on sunday. I was waiting on more to join but no one else joined and the 2 dropped out so I watched CEO instead KEKW
what was that sparkling thing
ive got the previous week's seed and one from mitzi, just need to find time for them
Its getting ready to rain so its nice and cool outside so took pupper on 2 laps around my community
what timezone are you?
I never done a randomizer before
I used to have super pape, enjoyed it but got bored replaying it. Just found a $15 copy on ebay. Asking seller for pics of the disc.
its the only pape game I dont own
cats running it has me curious again
first day on new job i had enough downtime to watch all of castlevania advance lol
ive never played a cv
poor komari, begging everyone to do commentary LMAO
was it meme worthy?
komari over here doing gods work
My starter choices are Scizor, Golduck, or Feebas
you know, I wouldnt be surprised if we did have a big direct planned then after all the leaks nintendos like "fuck this! Have a partner showcase you plebs"
Feebas would be pretty funny as a first nuzlocke choice
I love that im off on nights so I can watch streams like yours and cats rn
it was only for 9 months so it wasnt for that long
nah, it was 8am - done KEKW
Next Jan will be 10 years since I made my twitch account lol
first 3 people I followed was terra, ero, and kilios
ero went by method1cal, but dont tell anyone I told you that fifiBad
back when he ran bn4 LMAO
yeah, actually the teambn marathons would raise for charity. Protodude tweeted out the event and thats how I found everyone.
thats also how I found twitch
I wish I had repel gel irl to repel all the haters.
Does Repel gel work on bad RNG?
it technically would considering that you avoid the bad stuff but not the slow stuff
did you watch links awakening?
there were several points where both streams were damn mirrors
I was doing other stuff too so wasnt as focused on it as Id like
joke was too funny not to cliip
and the secret of dry dry ruin's will be a secret
I just saw this comment in rando discord
your tracker updates automatically to highlight what checks are available!?!?!?
mario just walking underground don't mind me
Just need the tts to say that
I had ENOUGH after month 1
can't wait for 69 months
when i got money i will get sub or just wait til i get gifted
drink a baja blast
would be fun if you could use the pan as a weapon
baby seed 1fp megabomb
hey taco he has your fav parther goombario
What was he cooking?
I'm glad you thought the same thing ohrocks
thanos appeared in my head
what was buff00n cooking?
I just like that like
He never said anything else there
He just decided "oh well"
Taco want to learn feint attack?
if I have something to remove do it
you have Bullet Punch, Leer, Focus Energy, and Quick Attack
No move rando? tacogu1Bruh
I have TMs and Tutors rando'd as well as move learn pools.
if you failed that minigame it would've made my sub a whole 19 months too many
When I say "good luck" what im actually saying is, Hey, I hope you enjoy my streams and give me a follow and maybe even sub ProgChamp
@TacoGuyy what does the catch rate setting do?
normalizes catch rates across the board
So legendaries aren't a 2%
I always run it on mid so I don't lose my fucking sanity
Cause then legendaries would just become a lost encounter
And with rando, anything can die somehow so I don't care if it's easy to get shit lol
okay cause I'm still thinking about what it did
but you hate poekmon randos
That's why I have my masochist settings
And also do it sparingly
Cause I'm just playing through the same game except it wants to murder me
how do you know it wont be fun a second time Kappa
Although with pokemon no matter what game I play with or without rando will overall be the same videogame lol
I never did get around to watch that vod
At least Rando makes me feel fear
I was about to start it but mitzi went live. Live content always beats vods
how fast will phantom do this boss
alright first encounter is a nincada
will battle network be in the direct tomorrow?
watch them have a megaman skin in monster hunter and you have to pay up LMAO
wait if I get shedninja from Nincada would that be considered a new encounter or a freebie?
Bass in mon hun would be cool tho
is 100 pit a legit thing or is it just a meme run at this point?
if I ever do pit Im titling my stream "I hate myself" that goes for golden pigs too
also work approved my time off for mwsf glennj5VIBE
bot spewing garbo rn
yo, I just heard from a leaker that GTA6 will be in the direct Kappa
i'm ready for people to be mad about the direct
What time even is it on wednesday
yea I'm not waking up for it
I will watch it after
I mean the YT video will have timestamps in comments
So I will just look at that
it never was stickshamGaslight
that's like the first time glenn has done that
I'm proud of him
glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE glennj5VIBE
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!!!
yeah cause you got banned lmao
this is why I say I need repel gel
They were really into the story he was telling them.
Paper Mario: ace attorney
it's been a while since I typed that emote
should've grabbed that Mystery smh
omg ubisoft leaked a release date for their own game LUL
Mario + Rabbids, im excited for it
we still havent seen any game play yet
if ubisoft is publishing it like last time I wonder if itll be in the partner direct
glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS glennj5HYPERS
that star piece is more special than you think
it came from gourmet guy
thinking about M+R has me thinking about a Splatoon Xcom
im gonna start getting ready for bed, thanks for the stream. Wanna get sleep schedule on track
yeah its gonna take some time lol
do the yoshi's deserve to be saved?
JYankee's Nincada has almost died 3 times to poison to wild pokemon
he wanted it named Sir Brapington
I'll never understand the mind of one named the JYankee
Plant is also a cherubi that will be a cherrim
"worst sNeed" has 1 FP Mega Bomb
today I learned that nincada is ground part
I didn't notice since I'm speeding up my grinding
Oof missed the run again! FeelsBadMan
we love a gamba
he just saved you from 3 caps
sub 3:20 still seems nutty for that seed
Alright, now do another one Kappa
7 hour run? woof
he is simply too cool for your chat window
you cannot handle his raw rad energy
i literally have not looked at or touched this game since it came out
this is gonna be some nostalgia
Give us park 3
Just give me a park game with shuckle
How long is park 2 all friends
I figure it'd be shorter cause less waggle
Maybe I'd join that depending when you did it
LOL just running right past the berry
this is gonna be good
fuck your blood money, chatot
going left cause you ain't treatin me right
"Del taco" thank you captions
captions are so good
I'm so glad panda cup had captions
Like it's just nice to have and also very funny sometimes
according to the captions: "Captions on Twitter so good."
I need to add them but I like keep forgetting to because I dont stream
The art is good
I had no idea you could post in that channel but I approve
Oh wait megaman isn't coming until next year lol
Nintendo just tweeted "next year"
I didn't watch the thing so I have no idea of dates LUL
Only saw the end from coney
So I saw the 'not rune factory'
643 sounds like a very irritating motion input
I hate 64 inputs
I'm glad I don't play any chars with them in anything
There's a few in blazblue that have them so I just refuse to play those chars
I mean like 646's and things like that
yea just back and forth inputs
Charge I hate but I can get over
just find them 4Head
if only you used my magnificent notes that have never been wrong
If there is loading screens I am always fiddling with something
I just fiddle with shit very quickly so I did it with windwaker constantly loll
there is only one game I can think of with a 753 input
There's a char in arcana heart that makes you draw a star and you have to do the directions perfectly for it
I should prolly like warmup smash at all today
I guess I should just play park or ttyd according to the bot fuck smash
But like I've gotten good enough results where to good people want to practice with me now
So it's actually fun before bracket
how is it going

go on the right of the bridge
if youarent dead middle you should be able to avoid it
grass type go brr
just use iron tail
I see people complaining the exe collection is just a pile of rooms, but to me it's still more effort than 3d all stars LUL
the art is neat
Galaxy was done very well I wish sunshine also was
I have complete works art book and music is on Spotify but cool to have I guess
the emulation bugs made it optimal for a little bit lolll
Cause it had the goop clearing bug where you didn't actually have to clear the *** on the hotel
That's how I feel about WW on switch if that ever happens
oh of course not
gyro controller go brr
switch WW at worst will patch out ESS bugs and at best will just have no cutscene skips and be 10 minutes slower in every cat
worse map and item ui tho
wii u ui goated
nothing beats a whole nother screen
yeah I totally feel that. since I got my everdrive switch online was never an option
phantom when we doing odyssey hide and seek
also with raphnet I can remap my buttons, something nintendo won't let us do
has it gone up or down in your eyes after enduring the speedrun?
sup nerd, how are you?
he is a nerd truuu
the only reason I'd play the bn collection is for ps trophies
@Glennjaamin all speedrunners are nerds, I'd know I am one
think that would be fun
what you run then counter nerd
love me some ps trophies
Octodad and Let's Tap, mostly
I'm assuming you've never heard of Let's Tap
if i google it i will
pokemon let's tap eevee LUL
it's a wii game controlled by cardboard box
Let's Tap is a video game developed by Yuji Naka's studio Prope and published by Sega for the Wii console. Along with Let's Catch, Let's Tap was the first game from Prope to be announced. Owners of Let's Tap can unlock content in Let's Catch. The game was later released as five individual applications for iOS.
@Axl_Sensei *insert vaporeon pasta here*
I found you through Speedromizer, you've probably heard of me talking about it there
i should do speedromizer but ugh
pls don't poison phantoms pure chat
links awakening was ROUGH last time
it deserves meme status, I just wish more than 6 people were in on the joke
you couldve just bopped em in
you heccin tbolted wym
why mash when you can tap fifiBad
speedrun is rough, game is fun but without breaks it's painful after a bit
me after my 2nd mario ddr run in a day
i gotta see what switch games i can do with the ddr pad tbh
A B and Z fourthgenKEK
i can always remap too
why can joker do fair 1 > fair 1 > fair 1 > arsene dair from a ps2 plat and murder someone at mid%
nah i got some booky hand me down
beat up on corphish, all of them are now your friends
can we do some pm rando today?
wtf is joker fair
I can do fair 1 > fair 1 > fair 1 > fair 1> dsmash at 60
and you can't DI the landing ones
Jaemi is playing joker now with falco and I don't like it
Leo was playing joker with gluto last week and it gave me hope
Then he did a corrin run the weekend after
remember kids - if you want to make friends, beat them up!
it's ok, all corphish are your friends
"I want you to prove the message is from Blazakin!" "alright, how should I do that?" "win a race"
wait, even worse - "convince someone else to win a race"
...how does he slide? Shouldn't he either hover or roll?
random, but I really think Splash should be able to 1 hit KO with like a 5% hit chance - Magikarp is capable of jumping a mountain, so he just hit the opponent with that jump
all the other 1 hit moves are at 30% anyways, so it's extra useless
just not "do nothing" useless anymore
z splash was +3 attack, closest thing to useful it got
"He's using extreme speed!" "What's extreme speed?" "it's when his speed goes to the extreme!"
did he say his "mime cart"?
it's not : )
i was trying to put a smile in text format but I got that instead
mod the game so whenever pikachu bonks someone he just shouts "EY I'M WALKIN 'ERE"
that would be illegal, but hilarious
how did Magnemite get themselves stuck in box? what a bozo.
Park community vote to legalize the newyorker pikachu mod
ok time to pack up for advantage state gl
Get that W Taco!
I'm getting better than 7th this time just watch
we gonna get that PR win
otherwise you won't be getting on the W wheel
the question is, how did Snorlax not notice?
you'd think it would be poking him in the back
so the dance pad "works"
and by works means it always holds down right and b while plugged in
even i don't have the patience for this
on gc its fine but it no likes switch
I have the wr for park 2 yeah
but do you really
lol looking forward to it
all friends is the superios category
Nah it's pretty free on all of them
lemme just remind you rq
phanpy gonna be the grainte zone runback Kappa
Hope you're fine with some rng though, if you're gonna run park 2 AF
phantom past the point of worrying about rng by now
Well that's good then lol
There's only really one thing that i find annoying at this point which is the melody box
You don't get that many opportunities to pick one up during the run and if you have some bad luck it can cost you a stupid amount of time
thats fair. ive also been busy with life stuff and such so ive havent even touched it in weeks sadly
thats good at least
BRB making a rando vid
ive got my vods saved, might as well throw'em up
Buy followers, primes and viewers on mystrm .store
I never really did a Pikmin run, should probably do that soon
i just gotta learn some stuff about the last area
that's so dank i love it
aw, this minigame hates you too
I could probably do 7 days in pikmin now that i think about it
which is like top 10 for wii lol
It's just that one gate in forest of hope that is awful
It's submerged in water and you have to do it without blue pikmin, which means throwing bombrocks at a really specific spot
pokemon getting in the way is the funniest shit
pfft ok that's funny
"defeating me will not be easy" says the farfetch'd
man i love when you get to fight next to hydreigon in park 2
He's always angry which means he'll attack the pokemon you're attacking as well
or you if you're particularly unlicky
Granite Zone here we come kaybee9Pog
What was the chance of this again?
Ahh yes, Gamblers Falacy
on the money man
didn't whom have to reset once cause he got 4 gold nuggets in a row or something lmao
I gotta find the clip i'm thinking of
pape gless or rando?
i mean, with park 1 you couldn't glitch the game if you tried
I do hope they make a Pokpark for Switch sometime, One can dream atleast... I feel like having two joycons could open up more attractions aswell instead of just a single Wii Remote
Or i guess there is that possible Snorlax skip but idk what happened to that
Apparently there is a very small area where the wall isn't completely connected and someone alledgedly managed to squeeze through with a turnaround thunderbolt in the air
@Chr33T what section you chatting about?
I'll have to check with Brady on that one cause i believe he knows the guy
It's nice that you always know where people are hiding in park 2
there are 3 different spots but they will literally tell you where it is
skuntank got fucked LOL
oh wow i found a clip of Wh0m seeing a pikaclip for the first time lmao, didn't know there was one
I'm glad it's actually useful in all friends, it makes it so much more fun
Oh yeah, that happens a lot
especially unawarehouse is just awful
and windmill way too kinda, cause for some reason when whimsicott is happy she starts beating you up
Unfortunate you don't have a Tepig in this game for this smh
Snivy for doing almost everything else
I like the play "play elite smash" redeem
i'd say that's a fair price
I can't with the movement in this game, Pikachu just can't turn at all
I have previously likened him to a crossatlantic steamboat
Gliscor just stalling the timer, As per usual
I don't like any of the fights in general, you might see why i don't run this game
Yeah i don't get how Zach can play any%
He just has Gigachad energy i suppose
Wii Safety Strap the meta?
Then you can pull full 360 rotations during Bulbasaur and Dusknoir
attempting all friends already?
i just got home from work
my brain is gone
i see you tried the dash hop now
dash hop dash hop dash hop
let's see if run blessed
pz. give us your blessing
what a perfect time for the stream to bluff
max dash is something
it's actually why i can't do runs right after each other
the speed throws me off
double dash is the same speed
if you said anything to me in the last couple minutes, I didn't hear it I got a phone call
honestly. i hate flys chase the most
park has really wild invisible walls
this was the worst in true hundo
whom was so annoyed at Lucario during true hundo
as well as nearly everyone else but whom got it worse
but as long as it beats cheezs
oh i meant Cheez's any%
cheez actually has a faster all friends than me i think
piplup would get wr ez with that speed
alright. i got google class to do
Cavern zone is crazy fast if you get bastiodon bonuses done consistently
messing up even one high point hit loses like 6 secs
also what made you want to do another all friends lol
i dont know if a run like this is marathon worthy
just 2 hand that bad boi
ninetails so fast wtf
im telling yhou 2 hands is going to be easier
how tf do you shake and press 2 with one hand
you are the only person ik who uses 1 hand
that pokemon looks familiar
you dont need to shake fast at all in the attraction
makes pressing 2 easier
i would never 1 hand absol's attraction
go at a more brisk pace
hiiii holy crap that's a long run
I mean I do watch AO runs when I can, they are fun to watch
AO = alpha omega
^so if I click the follow button, I unfollow....I don't think the bot wants that
there all alternate time-lines
dont get me started on modern warriors games please i beg you
hell yeah, sounds like a good time
yup! it was good!
my brother came up for my birthday today and apparently he's here so i was like "oh i gotta go" LUL
ty! gonna do a lil lurk while we eat haha brb
dont you love it
this ones got the best music so far
handling your wii with 2 hands Flushed
at work. tryin to lurk
audio only, screen off
did parakarry hit a smoke with Mario?
buff00n can't see me
what's the warehouse key unlock again?
do me a favor, if TacoGuyy speaks up, call him a bitch for me
advantage state was run so poorly last night
Hello! gl on the rando spaget3Wave
I waited over an hour for my r2 because they decided to add more people after the cap mid bracket
and I had to play on multiple tv's
whats that blue star?
happy heart could save your life
enough letters for parakarry (FAKE)
what a bizarre sNeed
I will get everyone to say sNeed over seed
I'm playing fox again
this char is not ok
no character is ok
cause they're not goombario
My back airs are killing I can't believe light lied to me
is the randomizer even more random
1 HP is good though
gdqLemons gdqLemons gdqLemons gdqLemons gdqLemons
@Ohrocks glennj5CRY glennj5CRY glennj5CRY phanto274Bless
I will now prosNeed to make food and freeze Baja Blast cause I hungy
I need to send you how this last game with jaemi ended LOL
My chair is terrible but if I buy one I want a comfy one
and they're fucking expensive
Mine is from someones curb
ok recording this replay brb quick cause don't want the audio to bleed into it
Ok so if I just disable preview I guess obs doesn't blue screen when I close it?
I'm too lazy to switch back to streamlabs so hopefully this is consistent lol
mine crashes even with preview disabled :/
worth a shot for sures
Sent you the clip, it's like 5 seconds
Even Kels is doomer about sonic frontiers
She literally called sonic her older brother on his anniv if anyone would have hope for this game it's her
What's up with the updates?
Is a ghost party member not useable in battle?
one day my LP skip will be that fast
boss is what, 22/24 and then 4 16s?
you get xp from the bills on the cannon fight yeah?
Tuned into the xseed stream and holy shit
RF5 looks really good when it's actually running
so what are the new updates
I assume you can if usable partners before you have them is enabled
because that's an option
the blast isn't frozen yet unfortunately
if you find goombario on the floor during MWSF you're leaving him there right?
how cool is it that we're getting a battle network collection!
I've only played the first and second one, so im excited to play through the rest
wow I've played 1 like 5 times lmao
I like it gerbieRip
But I also dont know any better cuz havent played the rest
dang I didnt even know they were on wiiu
You wouldn't BELIEVE where I had to check this seed
Gotta seed it to believe it
red arrow pointing to magic seed
I'm turning on the wii u
I'm gonna PB after not turning this console on for 4+ months
I'm starting as soon as this vhs watching stream I have up ends
Debating on just not using the twitch category though
Cause it gets views but like I don't want those views
is it faster to do the climb back down or homeward since it's in the sewer
are the seeds the only things you're still missing
does a fortress key unlock any checks
ok my only warmup is 3 tricks
and I did them all first try
That's honestly why I like don't really wanna fully quit despite not wanting to be around the community
Like I put too much time in and got good at this run I don't want to just throw it away fully
wait I should do greatfish swim before I actually do anything
I got it first try I hate it here
It's harder outside of the segment too because the cycle is consistent after the cutscene
ok time to go shit quick then I'll play a shit game
do you have P-up on?
in the most backwards way
25% chance to not heal 0% of the time
Bear's gonna kick me out so he can stream within the hour
you like funny stuff right?
was playing bn5 mashing select to skip cutscene and did a soft reset
i just finished drill2
that was annoying so i came here lol
did you make that
i never beat this game lmao
i never beat it either
and forgor what to do
im talented i know
mitzi are you a pikachu or eevee fan?
looks like you need to practice KEKW
i swear by single joy con
no worse than trnarrw
i love resetting 20 minutes in
Pikachu being viable? unheard of
this isnt battle network you dont have to rub your face against the wall LUL
Xbox 360 was peak controller
did xbox ever have notches?
playstation didn't have them either
FUCK that 360 dpad
what the N icon on the top of your screen?
there was only one model of 360 controller that had a switchable Dpad
we're talking an entire console that died cause you made the decision to buy the damn thing
you can have 360 Dpad or a normal Dpad
next to the switch battery percentage
them having an intentionally fucked up stick doesn't surprise me
I thought that was an N
never seen that on my switch before
hey at least you can abuse that 360 controller and nothing would happen
an Xbox One controller can't even take an inch of floor drop-age
I'm sad there were never any Baja Blast controllers
someone started a fight with me over twitter saying the series controllers are better than dual sense. Told him to go touch grass LUL
Series Controller is a Xbox One controller but with 360 Dpad again
its bad cause a and b are swapped
there have been times where I thought of getting a series S then I remember I dont like xbox controllers
Dual Sense is honestly silly to me cause Sony just said, "yeah people won't complain about this control change and force everyone to use this"
bonk this rat for not having good Sp. Attack
eating a fruit by the foot and remembered when dk64 came out they printed tips on the labels
you needed all the tips for that game lol
I was that kid who rolled up the fruit strip into a ball then ate it all
at school we each had a notebook and we copied each others tips KEKW
Taco retweeted a cool Wario fact
smash ultimate has 1068 songs and not a single one is from wario land
Wario Land doesn't exist anymore
everything is hand drawn
it was a pain in the ass for the studio who drew literally everything in the game, but it was pretty af
good feel hasnt done any nintendo stuff since crafted world
wooly world to crafted world felt quick
retro is just a back up studio
welcome to mt moon
official playstation tweeted about battle network... what is this timeline?!
yeah, its just wild to me
based off the text font, I'm assuming it's gonna be re-translated
that text on the trailer is just an overlay, its not part of the game
will they really re-release BN4 as that trainwreck of the translation it originally was
its just a bunch of casuals talking
the extra bn5 content is on DS
I'd hope we would considering this thing's not releasing until 2023
im cool with less comps to explore
the games are filled with content already
can I at LEAST do local netbattles
guess I'm not getting it
i hope it doesnt have online, it would be hard to find people to trade with on PS
its not the bare minimum, they are adding a filter Kappa
but damn, HUGE missed opportunity if it's treated like virtual console releases
someone went to AX cosplaying as the "Blue Eyes White Drag Queen" LMFAO
no drag like an okama
its like everyone forgot about pape races lol
it's ok axl if everyone stops doing randos we can just co op one every sunday or race eachother instead
I feel like there is a lot of rng with pokemon runs
hey streamer, wanna trade pokemon?
one time ryan brought that up so I came in it your stream "hey streamer, wanna trade battle chips?" KEKW
i havent watched in a hot minute
ive played 3 scenarios was fun but thats all ive done
whats your favorite spin off pokemon game?
first one that comes to find for me is pokken DX
it has quite a bit of polish which is weird for pokemon
I didnt really like conquest
yeah, never finished it
i liked it more than mystery dungeon. MD is just not for me I have tried
I tried the first one and the switch demo fat nope
then theres rumble LUL
i dont like open world either, played botw for 40 hours and felt ive seen everything it has
but I can get behind xenoblade
"tango supports bn1" then mars replies, "but it shouldnt" KEKW
this is a the game where you can have 10 hero swords in your folder
@Axl_Sensei then they decided that you can have 4 full customs in a folder for BN2
you can have 5 assuming you can find them
alo i find it funny
"fullcust? no one will use this!! Make its reg 10 mb"
bn3 they made it a megachip with 50mb
*splatters 200 bugs with their car, blood and guts everywhere* Local North Dakota resident: Did you hit a deer? "I speedrun Hollow Knight"
once I get some extra funds I wanna commission aixi to do a bn piece for me. a 4 piece of acdc town in a diamond shape when put togther
its okay, google doesnt know either LUL
Jozedenjoljonerez & Korean Toys & Kiro PJ Masks Toys & Jeri Mahlersaver
"sorry we cant understand you"
I swear, pokemon can attract people from all around the world LUL
be careful, the bot might learn what you're saying
russian? google said serbian!
phones get thinner and smarter and im sitting here getting fatter and dumber
what is considered cute?
are we doing pokemon contests?
dratini's japanese name is literally miniryu
are we throwing now?
you can fight blue?
that wasnt in the original games
never played this far either
I only practiced to the end of rock tunnel
might wanna get a better starmie
if thats blue then what do they call the female trainer?
this part of the run is like new content for me
i hope jcog comes back soon
i was asleep and missed it
with bug fables I killed the spider on hard mode, was so proud
yeah, im waiting til I get home and get it on ps5
ive played enough to know ill enjoy it
JACK IN POKEMON TRAINER EXECUTE!!
wartab improved wr on xy
one played them at release?
i just learned something I will never forget
The voice of Higsby from the english dub did the voice of bling bling boy from johnny test. This is so cursed!!
I loved johhny test as a kid, it was a guilty pleasure
pikachu just wants to be fabulous
need more of this cats4eWiggle
i fail to put into words why I love that so much
ill be back later
i should've had a like 3:10 rando yesterday but i got soft locked and lost a bunch of time
it was quick. gl on this
Buy followers, primes and viewers on mystrm .store
Big D is in top 4 for goml
I just got home from work
Aaron counterpicked aegis and still got shit on judging by the setcount lol
He has to play Cosmos to get to LF
If big D beats this matchup he is just the best player in the world honestly
Grands has the combo breaker steve
Also why the fuck is coney there
but they put max on top 8 mic
TK can only carry so much
Ok cosmos is 30 seconds in and already playing this matchup wrong
he got to 100 immediately lol
oop nana killed him
nana AI is the only thing holding big D back
didn't they fucking buff that at one point too
She still leaves you offstage
big d won game 1
Cosmos is playing mythra the whole time here for some reason
He is getting punished on hit instead of playing fire ike
Nana died and the crowd is just chanting sopo
he is out neutraling aegis with sopo
Wtf is this desync
He's making nana dash upsmash alone and covering her after
Cosmos got 2 stocked
Tell her she's a nerd
@TacoGuyy knives says you're not allowed in her house
Does she pay the mortgage
She has no power
She prolly lives under the stairs
Big d is about to 3-0 this nerd lolll
he hard read a swap and almost twitter clipped the shit outta him
oh he killed nana last stock
cosmos almost choked that LOL
He cannot edgeguard sopo
he jabbed them with pyra at like 160
Big D took a stock in 20 seconds LOL
I'm listening to MVD and knives antagonize each other
oh my god he almost took a full stock with sopo LOL
soap would def kill a smasher
ok another 2 stock
A quote from Jibca "ICs could be fucking garbage or lowkey top 10 And I'd be not surprised either way "
They have so much shit but at the same time they have so many weak areas but can also be covered by random technical shit so it's like fucking impossible to say
Riddles killed sopo right away thas crazy
I have no idea what big d is doing but all I know is that I want him at more shit
I need this I don't need byleth
Big D is already up 2-0 on riddles
I don't think Kazuya can 0 to death IC's
ok nvm he did electric and nana ran away LMFAO
Ohh I think Im holding right too much for LP skip and not just basically down
Thatll speed things up
Yeah like after I fall
Ice climbers steve grand finals
So big d is in panda cup finals lol
The canadian color ice climbers win the canada major on canada day weekend
i love this game, i got stuck in the lost woods section
i dont know what to do
just go the right way
whatever the water plant thing
i have NO CLUE
Bear I can show you when I come over
Holy shit the crowd difference between big d and onin LOL
Granted it's a canada event but still
For me its usually worth it sadly
Big D 0 to deathed last stock
M2K tweeted in all caps "ICE CLIMBERS 0 TO DEATHS ARE ACTUALLY COOL IN THIS GAME"
He didn't even do a true one
he just read a mash in the air with up b and he fucking exploded at 60
I forgot that move is like PM levels of knockback in this game
Nah youll get 2 ruins keys in mt rugged
Big d was so fucking close to making a sopo comeback
How do you do that against a fresh stock of steve
oh god I forgot I added fresh
Well not a key but still oof
he just used a penis to edgeguard ic's
Steve is a blessing
TK said it was big d's little brother
Someone tweeted a selfie with big d
I forgot he was like 8 feet tall
Yea Kiwi tweeted a pic with him and she was literally half his height LOL
well you're also a giant
Big D lost :(
Steve put blocks offstage and IC's couldn't come back
You can do all but 2 checks in 3, yeah?
Yeah double dipping blows
Why was aaron seeded higher than big d though
Hi there. Been watching your Paper Mario Rando VODs. Thanks for those. Been looking to catch you live one day,
Big D got 9th at genesis, Aaron gets top 32
Big D had 15th seed
That's his region they should know that he doin bullshit LUL
I think it's quebec because coney was french posting
Hmmm, a bit partner starved this seed I see?
Well, the major ones at least
What a month or two for N64 Rando. This has been out for a bit, and DK64 Rando is almost hot off the press
You're gonna play dk64 rando, right phantom :)
N64 Rando is on my to-do list, but right now the only equipment I have to work with for emulators is Dolphin (Metroid Prime 1/2 Rando for me)
I should setup bizhawk
Our community has a cross-game multiworld tourney in-progress. We just started the brackets
Yea it['s very bad
and they scold me to give them money every time I open it and I have to wait a minute to open my rom
One of my brothers has our old N64 and (as of 3 years ago) it still runs. I'm wondering if he'll let me take it
Yea if you open it without having a linked thing of donating you have to wait 30s to open a rom every time
Where was the 1st TBC small key?
where was the train? lol
@TacoGuyy PJ64 devs DON'T want you to google search resource hacker
So how does logic account for battle necessity. Will it try to avoid placing progression in a Chapter 7 scaled area for example?
"To start off I should clarify
We Shrooms are a fickle bunch
literally me anytime I take a day off
Oh not again with Star piece Toy Box
That's fair. I'm a fan of the Danger Mario setup. I don't play defensively in games
there's also like 4 checks there too right?
So one question I've meant to ask. What's your fascination with Attack FX C?
4fp mega bomb is hype
@CaptainMD13 It's literally the Best badge in the game
Still doesn't beat the Super Bombette from last month (The 1 FP across the board one)
I have a PM 64 Badge Tier list coming out in the future at some point
it's an M4 Collab
Sooooooo that's 2 Bow locked major items
Hmmm, and Chapter 7 is off the table too cause Laki right?
Maybe I got my sewers mixed up (Happens a lot)
I'm thinking the spike pit
It is up my alley of stupid
But yeah, I'm guessing 7 or upper KBF
but it actually serves a purpose optimally lol
I have never done it tho
96 Star Pieces does it iirc
Got enough Life Shrooms?
I watched M4 lose an hour to it bc that category also skips Lucky Star
Wow, Super Badge Toy Box apparently
BTW, SGDQ was amazing this year
I watched like 6 runs
My brother nearly cried watching tasbot Ocarina of Time
Hai hai. : D
I too watched a ton of GDQ
@TacoGuy74 Shove him down the stairs and make him actually cry
I did cry at it, Taco.
Highlights for me was ZOOTR, Mario All-Stars ACE, and ESPECIALLY Metroid Dread.
@TacoGuy74 why are you such a tsundere
@buff00n you replied to the wrong one I think
By the way, MH Rise Sunbreak came out and Oh my gog it's so good.
Either way I have no clue what you're talking about
the Ty run was cool
Besides the linkus run I kinda just watched what you said was being presented well
Also, Chapter 6 scaling?
Linkus is very good at solo commentary but I also don't know why he even had 2 comms
1 literally never talked LOL
@TacoGuyy Tsundere would be a good way to describe your online personality I feel
I really enjoyed watching SMO and the new Kirby run
@TacoGuy74 No buff00n is just a bitch
They added a wolfy boy for MH Rise Sunbreak, and, the turf war between it and Zinogre IS THE COOLEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.
Good thing there were like 3 Life Shrooms LUL
Man why is battlebeaver still using a hexagon logo I saw them pop up on twitter and was worried LOL
So remind me again, how often does Ralp's shop update?
@TacoGuy74 takes one to know one, puto
Why do you keep responding to the wrong one
He is red and I'm fucking yellow
If I shared a clip of the wolfy boy vs Zinogre turf war, would you take a look?
Legit the coolest thing I've ever seen.
I messed up this trick so bad in my last RAC run
it made a thread of my response to your response to 74's inquiry
This'll be something else if Bow is here
it's cool that it's the "optimal" strat
you hit that via force of habit
especially since we need laki in this room too
What aspect of talking about my brother nearly crying over Zelda makes me tsundere?
Oh, the bucket thing was a TF2 meme
@TacoGuy74 I called OG TacoGuyy tsundere
It's just this one line from an animation that reached meme status
It'd be a shame if someone....mega bombed them
faster than a refresh
so I cringe every single RAC run
I mean you gotta do what you gotta do
we disrespect 2-3 Jamin' Jellies in that run
So anyways, I started blasting
Hows the rando treating you
(Sorry, bit of a sucker for comedy)
Also how is you
Didn't you mention something about showing this at an event coming up, or did that pass and I missed it?
I came down with a bad case of COVID and Im having a blast lol
Im just speaking words
M4 has the lucky job?
You do not want me rolling seeds. There's a reason my partner and I are called "The Best Seed Rollers" in our Metroid Prime Tourney
But I've just felt very sore and congested but it'll get better
I used to be the primary coordinator for the Prime 2 Weeklies, but my current schedule and the tourney is keeping me too busy, but chat loved it when I genned seeds.
Thats a solid couch
Midwest SpeedFest. That was it, I'll try to remember that
dude these clubbas are adorable
And now Im currently watching smash twitter fall to the ground and laughing
Point still stands. Run, he angy
LOOK MAN THAT INKLING IS NAVY
Also Tubba showing off his SA-X AI
Bow on Ralp, let's gooooo
So does the real FP cost now show in the Badge menu?
I got a 107 on shade
I think Shrink Stomp is how I beat Master 1 my first playthrogh
How many life shrooms you got?
(And this was around Chapter 2)
There were like 3 in toy box
missed 2nd place on the stupid board by minute and a half for what its worth
What did tubba do you you huh?
devil has it down to 45 minutes so with some work can easily get it down to sub 1
Made us double-dip his castle for one thing
Keep a key in said castle for another
Also hi Bow, can you tell us where you're at?
yes, im talking about the thing I refuse to submit too
i say that despite I did submit a sub 30 for bn2 LUL
So right now we need Kooper, Bow, Pyramid Stone, and Magic Seeds 1/3/4 and that's it, right?
that was the first time I got sub 30 I was so proud lol
Wow, game calling me a liar psykitHeck
idk man that honey lookin mad nice
if you forget if you have something thats what the tracker is for Kappa
I mean....we need that...just not by itself
track means track, er means the action of doing something LUL
Laki is just a universal Key
So this chapter is either gonna be standard or baby scaled
dont be such a bitch
waits you your mitzi impression "Axl! Listen...listen..."
What a weird day it is to have to be "looking for kooper"
*chuckes* I'm in Danger
Anyone just see a boss?
Nice 1 of a kind Starpiece
For the 1st time literally ever
That may be the most cursed sentence i've heard all day
now that ive learned up to shade I can do lotto codes phanto274Hype
well the snowman's gift checks aren't in logic bc the ch1 bucket
I was a slow typer on that one
"Bow! Why were you hiding in the Mayor's Dresser???"
To spook him obviously
Excuse me, what the psykitHeck ?
it feels wrong to be excited about finding him
Well got an early morning at work tomorrow. Good luck.
Oh lord she commin lol
is this game I dont know if he's shit again
Where else would they be
mega bomb is good and fair
you mega bomb my heart
Is it now lol
yes you saw how long it took him to hammer
just doing my part
i did not but my sob is 45 minutes faster than my pb now NiceSoftlock
gonna try again tomorrow
People have been spamming fireworks for the past 2 weeks
pretty sure i'm not going in on tuesday cuz of sickness either so that's another day for runs
What happened to him...
didyou do weight check?
Hello Phantom5800 playing Rando!?!? lol | !discord !pb !mwsf Paper Mario English Randomizer Retro N64 Speedrun Closed Captions
who knows whats in there
Man you're just having the best of luck rn
it's always super blooper lmfao
i think 9/10 seeds i've played have had something locked behind that chest
That tree has 1 eye ball but 2 pupils
should probably check if my console still doesn't like rando
it's been a bit
I found laki there in my last seed
gonna take a random guess and say it was overheating in the entertainment center it was sitting in before
it was only with rando which i found interesting
never my vanilla carts
but it'd make sense i think
that was excellent comedic timing
fuck it, i'll do a seed offline lol
just in case it explodes again so i don't look sad on stream
phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
are you ending after this?
watching the subtitles try really hard to interpret all the pape terms is so funny
id kill for a sub 4 seed
get on my level
I will be there :D
Did you plan the yellow shirt to match pikachu? Its a nice touch
get a pikachu already slowass
Misogyny makes pokemon runs go round
My chair expired I can no longer sit down in maplestory
Wdym what I didn't stutter
playing let's go even though the titles is legends hmmmm
u going to port priority
I feel like lets go is new enough where it's not going to be quite as effective with the category
oof I thought it was in whika or something
If you named it sway that wouldn't have happened
Yea but he was goated anyways
ok now gotta get back to mass murdering elephants for a lil birt
Look a random dude hiding in a clocktower told me to, I have to
I fucking hate the category name
you didn't skip one trainer nice category
I was gonna mess with the new reworked classes after I got bored of this one but I like this one too much
I got motion inputs, a giant axe, and semi-technical movement from said motion inputs
I got supers and shit too
if I do 21456 I get a big tornado
And I'm one of the 6 legendary heroes so I need it
DP input is a single target move that just fucking nukes bosses
can only use it with full meter tho and that's annoying to build if I'm not in a field
scales off hitcount but I also have a button to just fill it every 4 minutes
ok back to murdering shit I'm almost at level 200
I think 300 is the cap I forget if they raised it or not
I'm sad tho because this quest series had a cool plot I was enjoying but the boss is really fucking bugged rn and keeps DC'ing me halfway into the fight so I can't finish it
this clocktower dude is sending me into the hell forest now
maybe I shouldn't have mass murdered elephants for him
I wanted to hear komari's brazil lady rap LUL
Down In Pumpkin Braz-Hill LUL
I had a sick shadowman fight today, I one turned him lol
emotion bug is so good
how the fuck do I navigate the hell forest this shit sending me all over
This forest is reducing my characters sanity and there's spooky trees 'n' shit
oh you said hell forest so I assumed pape lol
The longer I'm in the forest the lower my max hp gets while im in there
and I have to reset my sanity with a mage if I don't wanna die
I was told to go to a mansion in the back of this shit and this shit just a maze
just don't go insane
the hallucinations are getting so thick I can't see shit
I tried to look up a map and this forum post just said "don't"
this the best gains I need my 4 levels >:(
no they said this area is bullshit LOL
Thor changed his twitter pfp to a lovelive girl and I hate it
he's not watched it he just said he thought it was funny
all gyms should be like this
I hate doing filler battles
I just want to go fast
@buff00n soon you'll sub to phantom, poor ass
when I'm not broke af, sure
I only care about filler battles if they are randomized cause that's exp and I want to see what I'm going up against
yelling at a friend, cuz they can't accept that fighting games aren't as responsive as most other video games by design
tell him he's ass at fighting games and move on with your night
I only remember hate
the only quote I remember is quote #1
I can't remember how to
do I win an Oreo?
I ate the last pack of oreos
the last pack of The Most Stuf Oreos
most stuf oreo is so cursed
Uhhhh because they felt like banning the hard one
that's not just an ordinary Pikachu, that's a Detective Pikachu.
just a a big 5, add 100 to 100%, and 2P
Work had free sandwiches today and it was rad
I got 2 club sandwiches
Ok I found a map
I'm outta that stupid shit
oh thank god it spawned me back here
why does this damn mountain also kill my sanity
did you make out yet
I've not been paying attention I've been navigating this stupid area and talking to people
just noticed your category
when I run bn5 Im gonna pick a different bn game everytime
just to fuck with everyone
Also hows the run treating you
I'll title it after the catergory
I can see it now...
ASMR STREAM!!! | Another Shitty Megaman Run |
I just use retro so the live bot doesnt list me in discord
also since there is such a disconnect with teambn is it even worth submitting to the board?
like i play the game because its fun
I grinded bn2 to get a wr then got bopped a week later. I never want to do that again
i felt like id get it enventually so i never stopped
the last bn2 run I did I got a 2nd prism from the trader so there is other stuff we can do, plus jugoomba is maniping Dash in single segment
Someone make the fireworks stop lol
you sound like Hikari
yesterday I reached out to JP Kellams on twitter, he confirmed he did translate bn6 which was pretty cool.
he started at capcom, moved to platinum worked on bayonetta, then EA, and now he's at Epic.
Find it interesting to see how devs more around
title my game whatever jugoomba, risch, or komari is streaming LUL
Bro just watched an ad for butterfinger now I'm hungry LUL
ive got your raid msg
Scooby was lit, PBed in Warpless so that's dope
"well, if it isnt the hottie thotty with a naughty body"
bot is still subbed from me lmao
oh shit u have 7tv
AND you put dog island emotes?!
it was on 6/6
he needs to make another funny quote
funnier than... Ok failbot didn't go yesterday so it was like final where he talks about the abomination that is Origami King? LuL
my nephew was playing the pokemon mmo and showing it to me.
I liked the presentation
was like gen 3 engine in HD, but battles on gen 5 engine
its hard as fuck
lorelie has a cloyster with skill link
oh snap, since shasta is back from gdq he is stream streetpass lol
this would be the time to do that
if I went to gdq id bring all on my 3DS
i think im down to 4 but one is still sealed
the fire emblem awakening bundle
one day I hope to meet laura bailey and have her open and sign it
I just saw what game this was under
what I look for in starmie is HP 109-122, Def 82-96, SpAtk 106-120, SpDef 82-96, Spd 110-124
alright I'm back I was adding like so many emotes to my channel MozzarellaSticks
my practice save has a HP 113 ATK 74 DEF 88 SPATK 123 SPDEF 87 SPD 123
no prob, im always down for calling out communities LUL
Is the timeloss primarily real or diff catches/evo
haven't seen you run Let's Go in while
grinding for 3:01 now
the 3:02 has a minute long optional so I want to get one without it, and maybe push for 3:00
oh that's the roughest one
it's better to just do them after Sabrina
yea because you have to heal after Sabrina anyway so you're double menuing
if you depost before
yea golds are kind of pointless until after Sabrina
I use a one page printout with just the shops and some ranges now for notes
as long as you have an antidote, an awakening and one of the fake full heals you're fine
Yo I got a 4pm pool for doubledown
Jesse got a 10am ripbozo
Is a sway pikachu
I saw a stupid twitter thing that was a twitter family thing so I clicked on the site "don't tweet" cause I just wanted to look first
and it fucking tweeted anyway and tagged everyone
and ohrocks was my spouse
random art account I follow and RT was a child
Oh god Splash had one and it made him marry pallos
I can't complain anymore
Looking at a list of MN players on a tier list maker and like there's very little character variety here besides the top people
Like at least they're playing good chars but it's just all swordies
Lucky mad good but plant has so many bad matchups
There is so much fire emblem and link and palu on this list
both link and yink
Idk they think he's cool but then I camp him
Get another sway pb this instant
ayo fuck that guy
Tux is in my doubledown pool
Buff00n passed him along
a megaman player is before that ugh
The lack of murder characters is why our #2 is pplant
If I manage to get RAC into the marathon i'm after I asked M4 and Arie to be my couch
Went in with 1 yesterday
i mean, you KNOW the game knows.
i can't be convinced they aren't sentient
bombette was on a treadmill lol
how many panels are in the game?
that doesn't sound bad
does that include chapter 8?
not doing letters in marathon?
after I do mitzi's seed I want to try panels
I know where a few are
I'll use a guide for the ones I don't know til I memorize them
crazy how the races just died
u drowned? that sucks
did you just throw a hammer?
@trustyaltruist yeah my bad, i meant sinking
call an ambulance, but not for me
tbf i received swim lessons every year as a kid and i still can't swim
I hate the ocean
i could float but not get anywhere
I like looking at it tho
I've always been afraid of submerging my head
also don't like my face getting wet
Hai hai. : D
Oooh. Looks like I got here fairly early.
Where'd you find your companions?
Rigby had a seed this morning, was nice to chill since work was dead
Poor Sushi being exiled to the desert.
also I changed my name to pink today lol
mitzi called me out LUL
Welcome to the best color, Axl.
Axl, Listen! you are green to me! LMAO
you have a different shade viki
There's one piece of Exodia.
okay she didn't go that far but wish she did LUL
At least you got a mushroom to heal that trap damage.
Cheer100 Phantom going shinedown on us Don't you know I broke the mold Like a hammer to a landmine
What was that alert LUL
Is that moment clipped?
Begging your pardon Parakary?
shinedown is a band and when you hammered bombette it reminded me of them
would they be considered butt rock?
i think i get hinder and shinedown mixed up
I always forget that hidden block
also when you start with sushi do you get the upgrade block in toad town
here i though my boi was picky HahaSweat
I know otherwise it's pretty slow
i mean i do too tbf
It's be nice if key items had a slightly altered sprite like they do in Kirby Air Ride
Yeah, if it's a trap
Like for example the Tubba key missing the black dot in the center
Or Bombette not having her fuse
Oh yeah, it'd have to be the mildest of changes
Flower saver with a 3 FP Power Bomb? I like the sound of that
That works for me, my watching schedule doesn't free up until Friday anyway
I actually gotta bust outta here now and lurk to sleep before work (up 3 AM). So good night and good luck.
How do you wall?
Is there like ever a case where you just fight Kent? Like if Chapter 1 is Chapter 1 scaled?
I just witnessed heresy.
Ok I think we're good on Repel Gels, thanks
Now can we have that 3rd Ruins key?
Do you think that this is fake?
the power of ultra stone give it back!
you already had gotten a fake one in toy box
I think that I was there for that.
not like you do with the star kids Phantom
you bully them more
Last Stand is going to either be 1 or like.. six BP
Called it. : D
But don't you want to struggle for our entertainment?
I'm banking on another French vanilla TBC Small Key
And that becomes 1 FP with FSaver sooooo
Hey! Saw ur vid on my youtube recommended and came to check out the stream
Just go beat Bowser right now.
Yup! Thats right :D
oh don't be, i work for a school district and it's summer so it's not as wild haha
woke up from a nap to find myself here
that sweet sweet IT work
i remembr reading that in high school
there was a girl that had all the volumes and would bring them to class
yeah, im my circle of high school friends we would collect different manga
yeah, cannot re-read that as a 30 year old ass man
imagine a pokey pet emote with needles sticking out of mario's hand KEKW
glad i did this, but FUCK
ive always been really good with emote ideas
but I want you to
this better add up to something Kappa
really... dividing your time between toad town and shiver city :)
I'd rather fight ch 7 Jr than type on mobile
that's all i got.
calculator jokes are underrated
what settings are you doing?
what do the numbers next to the star spirits mean? They weren't randomized, I thought
my seed for v0oidathon almost forced me into anti guy in sphere 0
I had bow. and I had access to lemon candy...but the ingredients where held hostage by shy guys..in a ch 7 scaled ch 4
oh no,rigby did your seed die?
no, my cats are meowing like they are in pain so I'm taking a break to check on them
that's the dried shroom from ttyd
LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
Is it really random?
Has the luck been good so far?
Damn that sucks lol
Oh fuck yeah I just saw lol
now im watching 2 rando seeds at same time
this and 1 on me phone
got to go somewhere
ill keep stream open
How goes today's randomizer?
Have you tried turning it off and not turning it back on again?
If nothing else, you have some seriously cracked badges.
Welp, at least you already know by the point it's gonna be long.
Do we know your FP Plus BP cost yet?
(Can't remember if you have one already or not)
An aquaintance of mine from a server I'm in actually made a concept for a timed treasure hunt for Paper Mario Randomizer.
I play MH. That was not too fast.
Yeah, basically, certain types of items you collect are worth a certain number of points, and you have 3 hours to collect as much points as possible.
What I find funny is he made Goombario worth double as many points as the other partners because he's such a burden. XD
I think it was also designed with maximum randomizer settings in mind, other than always starting with one partner.
Ah yes, here it is. Badges and Star Pieces are worth 1 point each, Important Items and Partners are worth 5 points each, and Goombario and Each Star Spirit is worth 10 points each.
So the max point total was 530.
You can only hope by the time you have to come here you have Lakilester. Makes it a bit faster.
where are you going now?
audio is laggy let me refresh
yo outback is here!!
gonna grab my steak
dont be such a bitch
what did I miss
my medium rare steak was cold but still loved it
you got super mega ultra digivolve boots
damn 1fp mega bomb
need that in my rando seeds
but yeah you just got ultra boots
with a last stand set up, it definitely is
you're missing something important
There was one sandwich left at work and I took it immediately
It was a chipotle club I had to
yellow shyguys :O almost as good as pink ones
look at this baby ass seed
im playing some dbd with my friends. trying to convince a group of em to play among us cause i feel like gaslighting people
When was the last time we played among us phantom
How long ago was that loll
time to play again mwahaha
I forget if we ever played after my birthday that one year
We were playing that shit so much when prox came out
how is the run going Phantom?
are you doing more after this run?
that means bn6 rando!!
lets go rando would suck
Pokemon randos are fun
but only if you nuzlocke
okay pokemon randos are fun, but theN you hear phantom bitch about how much he doesnt like it KEKW
what the fuck is your inventory
seed was really fun [after i found laki]
really doesn't take that long to learn panels tbh
i've done like maybe 5 hundo runs and know where they are
do a 6th hundo run
im interested in learning them
mm = my mpapermario
mega man 2 is my favorite zelda game
its from twilight princess
no going fast allowed
Uh oh LK tweeted about wanting emotes
He summoned the bots
i was so annoyed having to full clear ch7 for sushie in my last seed lmao
that's one of the worst chapters to have to do that for
I love Flower Fields. If I could, I would replace all areeas with Flower Fields. The amount of skill, calculations, and sheer intelligence involved in navigating the many entrances make for the most memorable area in Paper Mario. I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to skip this area or even worse, remove it from the game. The only possible substitute that comes to mind is The Great Boggly Tree, but that is a story for a different day.
yeah 6 is fun to do in rando, it doesn't really take long besides moles and rosie
that one also has a lot of checks on that path
so it's not as bad
twitter talking about next switch, okay thats enough twitter for today
when aren't they though
i reached out to aixi for a battle network commission
so imagine OG acdc town painted, but in a 4 piece in a diamond layout
morph sucks at major league
we do slowruns around these parts
your bn3 follower goal was 350, you increased it LMAO
let me grab my old screen cap
now where the hell is ms paint!?
oot hundo no srm is sub 3:50 now wtf
happened this morning lmao
I was about to bring that up
That was the run that started after I went to bed lol
He has touhou on his splits he's based
when is triforce% getting bopped?
It's just sakuya anymore but it's still touhou
how did I type just
this is a different ace
The best ace is still the pokemon yellow one
a lot of it was showing flavor text
i'm guessing you sending us to Rigby after this hehe
oh? random is live
im gonna tell him you said that
hehe he is white
DIE COTTON CANDY DIE!!!
it's the final battle!
ace could get you there
with boss rush, it should warp us to that duplighost room after the last star spirit is saved tbh
you could jsut call time when you get your last card
we'll call it phantom%
my brother walked in and said, "hey he looks like our cousin!" Me: dont insult phantom like that LUL
Wow phantom you look like their cousin
Wow phantom you look like their cousin
Final battle time for the 49th time
I am not allowed to use any food delivery app, apparently
I don't blame them
I ordered food, it didn't arrive
well hes called buff00n for a reason LUL
easy win secend win
How do I how do I always get here at the end of your runs LUL
I order, then SOMETHING always happens
what will the title be called on youtube?
did you get your 7 cap?
i don't think i've ever seen a 7 on final
honestly that sounds like it'd be a bad thing in some categories
like you just do too much damage lmfao
how is too much dmg bad?
he can heal starting on turn 2
so unless you beam on turn 1, he's probably gonna heal
forgot a check n ice palace and called it quits lmaoo
thanks for the stream
He swapped to pape
he forgot to change the category lol
I had to speedrun my raid because I knew you were finishing
the raid your problem now
maybe i was so early it seemed late
the ending music is so nice
was just thinking how funny it would be to swap between you and komari everytime one of you resets LMAO
Hey I hope you're having a great day! I love watching you speedrun and I watch you pretty much every day it's so awesome and entertaining watching you play and I think you're really cool and talented. I want to support you and see you achieve your goals. I believe in you
doing a stream before the game?
ill be doing a meet up with laichan next week
hows that any different?
did you see my smart watch pic?
Pikachu spedran to oak's lab
bn7 PET will just be a watch LUL
wonder how they'd handle new forms
Watching your pokepark run really made me wanna play it again
Congrats on the PB the other day
I heard first bug breakout
Really hope they make a pokepark3 for the switch and or port the first two
oh well, if you match without the optionals its like a 3:15 - 3:16
I was there lol
It was a grimer right?
yea theres luck for sure, but its definitiely rewards consistentcy
It was in the mansion
Get two shinys then
lol like 15, I once had a run with both Snorlax and Raticate shinies
I have a good amount of shinies from pkaying competitively anyway so its not a big deal to me
brock is the useless split
as long as I'm not like a true minute behind it doesnt matter
my gold is 17:07 in Pika for Brock
Do you have a favorite Pokmon spin-off game?
the end of the tail is not in the hit box also, I go for moon onix
Love the ranger games
especially not on lure its not a bad chance
moon onix >>>> rt onix
I deleted a bunch of runs recently
eventually i'll come back to let's go
Or just be like my not loaded to youtube Eevee PB where I catch Fearow, Golbat, and RT Onix
that run was awful
now my Pika PB I got a supersize cleafairy right after I deposited everything
less likely to get Poison Gas, you keep Oddish until Gloom, but I have different variants of the JJ fight because on my nature and stats at level 9
I also run minus Sp. Atk Pika
the 3:02 run is Jolly
it technically makes my first shop faster too
because I dont get x sp. atk
yep do that 2 turns
go for ekans first
so one thing I do is almost always catch Rat or Pidgey on Rt 2 just for the situation you find yourself in now
I deposit and go for Otto, risky but the Exp is worth it
Ill do it before Vermillion to get Growlithe to level 18
but not always, how I play depends so much on Pikachus level and Attacking Stats
its more dynamic than you could put into notea
seeing talk on twitter, imagine next gdq being in hawaii lol
its only because Ive done so many runs and have tried a failed a lot of different variants
it would be so worth
level 18 or really high atk I switch to Headbutt to save text screens
whats your take on walking into pink gorilla and potentially being on stream?
gotcha, he's doing a subathon so lurking for maybe a free gift LMAO
love the idea of streaming from a game shop
i never thought of that
agumon ha to funnier if he wants a sub lol
yeah, have him post in general
yea, that was good considering what happened
i saw that switch fans are getting excited for pokemon puzzle league. Nothing wrong with that but they have to wait a whole month just for a single game. "looks over at everdrive on GodsIntendedConsole "
oh that was a great, I'm used to seeing 475 exp on the pidgey catch
I always grab fire stone and evolve growlithe now and uses arcanine as a ride
yes, I switch, there's a long winded reason behind it that'll be tldr to write
basically fairy sac -> growlithe evolve at next menu and switch rides in hideout
it's risky for JJ Tower though
caterknees is actually the player I got the idea from
oh, Tuesday I hit them again so I spent an hour practicing a new technique to pass them
yea, that's my problem, but there's a small dirt circle immediately in front of them that I run to then slowly pass through
you're fine it's level 18
if you got gloom you got sandshrew
I've definitely run into that spinner a few times
so it's faster to add a pokemon to party over another party member
it adds and removes at the same time
gl on the rest on the run!
Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3 Ezekiel3
catch all the pokemon
catch like 20 or so more pokemon
I saw that you were playing Arceus and was like "wait, he's speedrunning a game I don't think he finished casually?"
and here I see Definitely Not Arceus
I still haven't finished O_O
word I never thought I'd hear
no shiny time to reset
ight best of luck go win or somethin
in BW, Starmie was the Pokemon I used to solo the Black Tower/White Tree and the E4
at least you got some XP/EVs?
Does Bruno still have two Onix?
you mean psychic doesn't just OHKO everything on her team?
Starmie looks back and whispers to you each time, "You're losing time, kekeke"
how is it a range at +6? Does it have Multiscale?
oh it's mega lol
lmao trying to use Solarbeam without sun
how did this guy become champion?
are you commentary for glenn?
that's like 10p anyway
thank you for saving me
i woke up to my air matress deflating
the nob got turned somehow
Matress: get your ass outta bed
it was like climbing out of a hamick
i know all the settings except for the toad at the end
all the settings? you mad man lol! gl hf
wrong tree but sure
yo icebound, whats good
was the new fetch quest added to the rando or is it in vanilla?
but how early can you do it?
i think that's it, yeah, post ch1
hello wiggle friendo cats4eWiggle
I'm donating plasma and then o have to drive half an hour outta town to visit a friend permitDead
2 coins oh boy!
If I don't get cake when I go visit this friend ill be upsetti. She's having a party for her kid
I demand cake if I am to be in the presence of children
note to self: dont have children
Oh wow sushi and watt. They really said go to lava lava right off the bat
sushi was on the island
as she should be Kappa
I like having the stream on full screen and chat on my laptop
coin is a bargain!!!
Oh man you gotta get that singular coin for a million star pieces
It only makes sense
so this rando's exchange rate is 1 coin to 4 star pieces
yo that storeroom had like 8 star pieces KEKW
i'd like to rework Merlow some time, his shop is usually pretty meh atm ..
are you using the new hit box Kappa
And we thought the fuzzys were thieves
Koopas out here stealing kitchen utensils
last rando I learned something
yellow yoshi wont take a super soda
LET'S GO RANDO RANDY sNeeds!!!!!
heard a loud crash just now
cat knocked over the rack for setting up balls on the pool table smh
My cat likes to open cabinets and hide in them
he just wanted his face scratched, he took off running LUL
I sunk a ball on break today, will never happen again lol
Why didn't you check the volcano when you were on lava lava?
that's not the boi
he doesn't play baseball and his name isn't Goombario
Oh yeah you had no parakarry or laki
Man the plasma place is super behind today. My appointment was for an hour and 15 minutes ago and I havent even started donating yet
I'd usually be dont by now
you need kooper for the bridge tho
are you doing "surfer dude" strats?
mushroom kingdom doesnt check for bombs/weapons in the mail?
LP must be too hard for you lol
i should probably remove that wall ...
get the goomba or I will cry
i mean, i put it there in the first place
ill look into it
with koopa bros ive seen leonardo and donatelo
damn... koopa bros are just missing mikey
ain't gotta be at the venue until 4pm my time
exactly what it means
it's 1pm my time
buff00n you missed it
our pools start at 4pm
PhantomGamesBot: Haha took numer one slot for axl if everyone stops doing randos we can start at like 160
i just looked back here, this is a dank looking fight
yeah they're surprisingly resistant
actually enjoying the song...
ajo wth, i just checked the koopa bros sleep chance, and all 4 have different chances??
green 70, red 30, blue 40 and yellow 60
slowly getting closer to bn3 SS
I want that coin you have on clearance. "yes sir, that'll be 1 coin please."
first try on getting my name right
thats a new record
hi phantom it's Brett <3
are you playing this on an emulator or console?
fuck that guy I got my phone back
he also said he loves this song
brett makes a better mod anyways Kappa
hello! saw your youtube stuff and wanted to hop in
I recently finished my first playthrough on an emulator and it was kinda broken
love me some paper mario randos
its always fun to call out mods
yeah I found you on yt as well
yours is the premiere yt channel for regular pm rando videos
i just like to watch the randomizer cause pain lol
I like looking for randomizers on games I liked playing
I got into super mario rpg randomizers because of that
there's others that stream it a lot but don't upload to yt. their fault ig lol
I've ran those so many times
i like the SMZ3 randomizer
I think the way we met was in jcog's stream "hey Axl, im gonna be running bn6" that def got my attention LUL
haven't done many Z1
have a good one!
bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL bearunlvL
that name sounds familiar
I have a friend who is top 200 in the world
his name is bond
damn bandits just not givin you a break
anyways I wanted to play paper mario randomizers but playing it on an emulator is not the best
least you have laki
so idk what to do
i've never had issues with bizhawk
oh im using p64
that might be it
p64 is ass shit
coming from someone who uses it
project 64's catchphrase should be "we run mario 64 good, and thats about it"
I didnt wanna deal with setup stuff so i went everdrive
i only use p64 for mario 64 rom hacks, cause bizhawk doesn't like them
paper mario on project 64 did weird things, like if there was too much stuff on the screen every single model would just disappear
it was especially bad on big rooms like in the volcano
if there was one extra thing everything just disappeared
because the room was so big
also the darkness effect where you have to use watt just didnt work
I had to fight lantern ghost without the darkness effect so it was very confusing
Goombario Slander is Cringe He's just as awesome as all the other Super Mario Characters, and you're not Based for disliking him just because he's 'basic'. FREAKING LOVE GOOMBARIO!1!1!>:(
also I thought koopa koot would actually give you something good at the end of his questline so I did every single favor
I also did every single letter
that one wasnt as bad
I think your bot is having a stroke
kinda reminds me of the deep leffen bot
I thought the bosses were gonna be a lot harder when I played tbjs
but I saw everyone raving about the later bosses
I didnt know what I was doing
and I got lucky on crystal king clones so that probably helped
actually yknow what huff n puff was definitely the hardest boss
I hurt my arm mashing for that fight
I made it through fine but he was the only boss to cause irl damage
I got to the final boss at level 20 I think
later game fights were just power quake + power bomb
Monstar's sooo hard to block
I never saw monstars attack I killed him on the first turn
the only badge I had that raised my attack was all or nothing
PGbot had a stroke and I missed it?!
but I used watt's powerup attack a lot in the later fights because I didnt have a lot of attack power
watt was the only partner I used for the bowser fight because he pierced defense
have you been to forest?
my most used partners were bombette, parakarry, and watt
i like having squirt at 1 fp
I used lakilester for huff n puff and bow for tubba blubba's heart but thats about it when it comes to other partners
oh yeah and I used sushie for lava piranha
who's your favorite partner character wise?
id say bombette character wise
my favorite character wise is bow
ive seen m4 blow the wall up early so ive been doing that
I also like parakarry as a character
where are the Panel Percy's at?
are you saying that you wouldn't sell a red jar and 2 letters in your shop?
I've played every paper mario game except the first 2 so I decided to play this one and I'm gonna start ttyd soon
where did you start?
the first one I ever played was super paper mario
when I was a kid
the first one I completed was sticker star
and then I beat super
and I also beat color splash and origami king when they came out
I enjoyed them I dont get the hate
theres a block there?
do you find the combat fun?
the hate comes mostly from people expecting more pm64 or ttyd and not gett it
I get that sorta but I think they split off from that format because of the mario and luigi games
just give me a reason to do the fights
and the fight itself isnt enough
I'm so upset about that m&l is my favorite nintendo series
I have every single game
Bowser's inside story remake dug alphadream's grave
as much as I've enjoyed the paper mario games nothing compares to bowsers inside story
that game is perfect imo
i finished the first 2 and started the 3rd one, solid games
Partners in Time is very cool! :^)
I really like every game
partners in time is probably my least favorite if I had to choose one
but I dont hate it
I still love it
I have an unsigned copy from Phantom
I also have both of the remakes
the only issue I have with partners in time is they took abilities away from mario and luigi to give it to the babies. Just seemed so backwards. give them unique ones
if AlphaDream remade those games on switch, I think it would've made a difference
bowsers inside story 3ds came out in like 2019
around the same time as luigis mansion and metroid 2
3ds is still my favorite nintendo system
oh Mansion definitely needed to be on switch
they could've been more experimental on switch
thats why I got the xl version
DS lite hurts too
I have a ds lite
switching from my ds lite to my 2ds xl is such a difference
it agrees with my agreement
my New 3DS XL is on it's final breath and it's becoming slowly unusable
I broke my old 3ds xl but thats because I wasn't taking good care of it
and it was right after I got platinum and got shiny stinko
how do you skip the text so fast
is that in the base game
that wouldve been helpful when my chapter 5 got reset
I play with slow text and slow go at the start
game is unplayable otherwise
these partners are being held hostage
ohrocks for the true RP immersion
im probably gonna lurk now since I ran out of stuff to talk about
Phantombot is a best friend
wrong % and wrong game but I wouldn't be opposed
it's Mario Mario and Luigi Mario!
we can feed gourmet guy actual food
there's nothing to debate
it's by law we need to feed him food and poison
I'll stick to GBA COM ty
to be fair, me telling risch about speed got him to join LUL
ShyGuys out for blood NotLikeThis
can't wait to see anti guy fight
youll have to wait for next stream
you streaming the game tonight? Kappa
how could you skip gourmet guy?
okay, watch is telling me to exercise
it's called laki clip
like every clip in this dumb game

Koopa Koot better get himself Lifeshroom insurance if he doesn't give you the goods.
any bet-er's in chat? modCheck
to see how this goes stickshamChaos
35 cals doing curls fifiChad
you got that epic mystery
why is mystery so bad?
see it worked Kappa
it's actually really good, you just have to be good at using it.
you can just practice using mystery
but you could get WR?
the mystery? item is the future of Paper Mario 64 speedruns!
kinda mean trap ngl
yeah, I saw a real life gamer girlfriend but not yours. Her heart belongs to a freakin' speedrunner he resets a lot and dont PB but she says he's the perfect mixture of dedication and self-loathing. She loves him and losing good runs is their world. bleedPurple
should've gotten another mystery?
Who is your favorite partner in the game?
phantom I need to ask
was that guy really streaming the simpsons under PLA?
Ive woken up on a saturday morning and found shrek movie under speedrun tag
chat made it so much fun LUL
where's the educational stream tag?
what the meme, "you cheated only yourself"?
Sorry I'm late, what'd I miss?
Your tracker just screams "all over the place"
Phantom how are you so good at this game? Not only did you have flawless fights, but you also used mystery successfully!
What's the Pink Toad setting? I know the other 6
im still waiting to see it
and ive been here 2 and a half hours
Well entrenched in Danger Mario I see
i spelled it wrong anyways
Good Grief, 8 FP WutFace ?
fake shoutout the link is wrong LUL
Nice BP costs, but I imagine the FP isn't as cooperative
Oh yeah, 6 FP Mega Quake
goomba king has koopa leaf
we've done prologue correct?
imagine if you had Mega Rush?
he really did glennj5BONK
should've had that damage dodge
anti guy looks like he's going to hurl
anti guy did warn you not to fight him
lurking reset, help me backseat him KEKW
Welp, 4 Spirits before Chapter 6 KEKW
I take it Allsanity doesn't enable all 11 Rip Cheato checks
at this point the koopa leaves are in some ch6 vine
hate to interrupt the speedrun, but could you check if that ultra shroom respawns?
okay then. welp, f me
I can't believe Mario has to spin all the way to Bowser's Castle on a Saturday! All the way to Bowser's Castle!
that coin is special
I knew at some point I guess, but never really thought about it
guess it's for when you don't have items for the ice walls?
aboutta head out to the venue
my bracket is MegaMan into tux into brett
did you get pre bracket Wendy's?
we just studied the MegaMan
yes ohrocks I did
well I came in at a fun time
I needa piss and these people take years in the bathroom
aww i wanted the jacked lakitu to punt a spiny at you
also buff00n laid ass up on the couch and combo breaker made much more sense
Jesse sent a pic to smoov
he got more cake than he eats
in the seed I had earlier koot kept like 5 items so I had to complete that assholes favors
I keep getting late supper cycle
ok time to go waynerGoChimp
if your koopa leaf is in star haven i get vip KEKW
and if it isn't I get vip
THE ACURSED ONE RETURNS
LUL LUL LUL LUL
i wonder if there is a pokemon hack the dresses up the trainer as Lan
oh phantom, last night jameike joined the race. did the countdown 3 2 1, and left the call before saying "go" KEKW
did you hand in lyrics?
i tried to tellrigby but he wouldnt listen
don't need to shrink when I power bounce him for free
could've had Mega Rush for 2 hours
how did I miss Goombario
can you make sub 4?
goombario was given to him but i forget where
yeah in the lobby
and never even so the non-replenishing koopa leaf
12 hour challenge is next month
theme is you must complete every stage, nothing youd be interested in LMAO
when is yur marathon?
but what if you hit 400 followers by then 4Head
i was just memeing LUL
if only orange koopa
I don't but go ahead
power shock is always fastest
Mario applying the repel gel against his biggest hater
ggs run was a mystery
metroid prime is some cool stuff
did you see it?
now to make that draw consistent LUL
I am excited to see this start to finish
my ass will not leave this seat
I am also high as fuck rn
the other day I went to the store to buy treats from my pupper and and charity girl stopped to ask me if I liked children, I responded with a firm "Hell No!!" Then I let her talk about her thing for 20 seconds and I but in with... you just saw me walk out of petco. Ask me if I like dogs next time. Then I left OMEGALUL
thats funny axl LUL
wish I could race but at least I can watch, which means I won't be playing this seed lol
@PerMitzi I try to please
I probably wont talk but I'll still be here lurking
I talk enough to make up for the lurkers KEKW
who u think is the better snake shogun or mvd.. or apollokage
really I thought shogun would be slightly.. he just doesn't go to alot of events
everyone knows phantom 5800 snake is godlike top tier he just stop playing.. lol
not even the bot likebuster only
i would join but i cant even play pape rn
imagine starting a race without mitzi axlsenS
Komari says, Agumon's right, it's a bad category Kappa
i believe in trnarrw
blue screen of death
lurking lost 2 50/50 3rd encounter was 2 mets and trnarrw and got rflctr
you hate to see it
i love skipping lp
didn't expect you to join another glitchless* race, how come? just feeling like it?
laki jumps are, i think?
yup, bubble berry tree and tubba table
geyser skip, tubba quick escape ..
@PerMitzi i see Mitzi is getting lost in Jade Jungle again LUL
Good Luck to phantom and nobody else 4Head
oh and artifact jump is also allowed for some reason
I forgor to gamble
volt shroom is faster than letting them atk you
what does whacka's bump taste like?
I knew it was 30 but this is a race afterall
Hi Phantommm, it's Brett <3
only berries and only tree or bush?
not a big deal but would be a nice QoL if when you picked up a star piece it showed your total count
poor lurking, couldnt get anything going
bn games be liek that
I think in almost every rando ive done, I have trouble finding the pulse stone
wow this rando REALLY wants to give you blueberries
that fuzzy is literally the worst
he rudely logged off my account on my laptop
Was that a red berry at whale screen?
mhh the logic implications
i think that's the earliest Ultrahammer + Ultraboots in logic I've seen so far
i guess. still odd
you can't early ruins as you break logic, but you can ruins jump to break logic?
in before Parakarry on pokeys
Is it alarming that I'm finiding you trading star pieces at 1:13?
Oh hai Magical Seed 3
I don't think I've seen you do a PM Rando seed where money has been an issue before
That looks vanilla to me
I meant the scaling
Is this like a community weekly?
You know Goombario is next, right?
LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
Nah, calling logic is just a normal day for me
gotta bounce, gl on the rest!
I'm betting Chapter 3
So much the better
I got a dragonite
It was my 6th shiny dragonite I dont need it lolol
I think the seed is trying to tell you something KEKW
Buff00n keeps muting your tab
He hates you I think
I got my pic with EE I have nothing else I want to do there
Unless I wanted to hug hbox and get 27 illnesses
Sounds like a great idea
Also Im playing cloud for the secondary now
brb quick cley is here uninvited
yo, just had a perfect cloudman fight
I just came off my Echoes Rando tourney match and that was bad too. An early-game item was flat out deleted from the logic
He wants to talk to you
What did quizmo do
Ugh, and Lunar Stone and Bean only lock bosses so they can be just about anywhere
My brother is sending me out to get food when I'm still covid positive
THATS WHAT IM SAYING
The audio is delayed slightly
that happens to me all the time, just pause and unpause
phantom, do you wanna be famous?
Eldstar Star Storm is cursed
I said what I said
haha ty it's ok
how can I explain the sound?
i don't know how haha
think this is a reasonable explanation
Revenge of the convenience
and hopefully he gives peril after shield turn lol
oof, if i close the stream but have pop out chat open I dont get channel points
this isn't too bad tho, it's 9 less damage than what a good phase 1 would have
since ideally he starts at 66
ive been watching on bros pc not logged into twitch with pop out on mine
probably gonna have to double repel but yeah should be fine
never in runs lmfao
i don't blame you lmfao
grabbing snack for this
learning more colonel today
darkmega is be providing content
I got 3 antidmg with shadowman then got wrecked by airhoc KEKW
I used to watch sparkle run that, then ironmon happened axlsenWut
no different than watching shiny hunting
i stumbled on a speedrun I never saw today
arkham asylum, top runs are barely just over 1 hour. The idea for 12 hour challenge is there but prob wont
gl on the run and congrats on the PB
what not trying for 3:00? lol
my 3:02 hits a minute optional so I kind of have to go for it
also just me being dumb in that moment
found eevee on mercari for 15 bucks
we fuckin died from laughter last night
omg... I just now realized the song is called Staying Alive
for the past 30 years I thought it was "Stay In The Light"
surely im not the only one....
they were literally saying stay in the light!
I come into the kitchen: MVD TacoGuyy and Brett are dead cuz they came up with "ice-clussy"
"DMs. DMs, DMs DMs."
damn he just repeats
got a 4:08 despite full clearing
so it was pretty good lmao
koot foiled my plans again
had to do up to glasses
yeah I only double dipped 3
and 7 I guess if you count snowman gifts then ice palace later
I technically double dipped 2 for the check past 4th key
because I spent a while looking for last seed
wait, I double dipped 4 because lantern ghost had my seed.
but those double dips were very quick
winding path had every good badge
power bounce, all or nothing and dodge master
I've always done that
because I always liked the +1 catch and not requiring a fast ponyta spawn for a fast route 17
wr strats weren't wr stats when wr was made
i found a new place to keep phantombot quotes
just whisper them to it KEKW
it was outspeed by Golbat so I think - speed
yet you can still PB because Alexa still loses you a minute 30
were you minus atk
ooga booga there's some spooky ghosts in my Pokmon game
I just woke up right now
but it's called Let's Go Pikachu, not Let's Go nothing
Pewter Crunchies for people with the Pewter Munchies
thats the one risk of arcanine
its fast so things might not pop up in time to see
game said no wtf?
8ball says... very likely in a future yet to be seen.
have you been in the PSR discord the last few days?
what was it I didn't catch it
so we learned the actual catch formula so there are going to be minor reroutes to get more great balls
wtf is a toejam and earl?
besically player 2 will have GBs as well for RT and on route 17 used Ultra and Great Balls
still true but Id rather have the consistent catches
I made spreadsheet for it already
but my reroute only grabbed one item. actually cooking rn cant get to it
did you type in the cp?
I killed with every rosa move
those are just LV 10 bots
It took me 2 hours to find a ness for down b...
Thats what Im saying
I have no idea
I memed a steve until 360 and killed with down throw
Hey it's a 62% chance, there's still hope in this run
odds got slightly better

you could rename the reward to 'break my splits'
I posted so many weed marios in the group chats for doubledown
especially the angry one
The angry one I just poorly drew on \ / eyebrows
I'll draw angry Weed Mario on my way to my cousin's place today for you Taco
I think it broke
and I ask myself why I haven't finished the art I'm working on
ok time to work kazamsCatglubhat
I was just going to say you should tell them you got that
We did not go to the venue on day 3 whatsoever lol
We stayed home and vegas people showed up
Played a while with grandmaster and him and brett dirty talked in friendlies
ok now I leave tacogu1Leave
hopefully I'll plan better for next major
I don't care about the game too much, I just care about seeing people that are "fake real" but will get to confirm that they're "real real" (REAL)
if this yellow rat said "wahoo" said some gibberish, and wore a blue hat with Pac-Man on it, I'd care a bit more
why's his name Blue if he's not a the color Blue?
I've been conditioned to Blue so hearing Green makes me confused
you were lurred in false sense of hope
alright I gotta head out but I'll be back when I'm on the bus
gl on the run, late misty?
did you miss excellents?
oddish broke out of an excellent?
oh, that makes sense
nothing on rt 2?
oh, I would have caught it still
honestly I would reset now, unless you get a super big
what's you're mashing tech?
of course it went to ad break as you were explaining
yea I'm back, a just heard thumb covers everything
I do index on LR, right thumb a, left thumb b
how tall are you?
ah, so yea big hands
oh I use my left thumb to move on right joycon too
oh no, I never wrote notes for that
no that was plus
it was 16 sp. atk at lvl 6
it goes 14 -> 15 if nuetral
plus atk goes 16->17
yes you should bumps the percentage of catch up 12%
idk if you play Sonic at all, but Tails in Sonic Advance 3 has a butthole and you see it within 10 seconds of loading the game
whats good my guy?
i just just put 4 msgs in komaris chat thinking I was talking to you
I had komari pop out chat over your chat LMAO
i was saying the CT started this year, and around summer of last year was last time I touched it
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KFNo3Mu5pjI6HMim-C5lR8sF6d_U0IdPRWcdGzcPqHA/edit?usp=sharing minus Sp. Atk Pika notes
oh yeah 12 hour challenge pushed me away from lets go
I did astral chain
well add them to yours
I want to make a time table for learning games
i dont have to follow it exactly, but just to have a general idea of what I want
now you dont have to get them later
yeah you can skip magmar KEKW
I hate I went to all the work of making a lets go layout and only streamed 2 "learning" streams
but that was my first 16:9 game
ive never seen sandshrew in the wild Kappa
it's enough to OHKO Starmie though guaranteed
33-34 5/16 35-36 10/16 37+ 100%
you need to arrange the ranges
missing it is basically a reset
oof, komari is on his 10th attempt.Its now or never
well that was quite the time save
10 attempts and he got a trnarrw K OMEGALUL
leaving seaside with a 19:27,not happy about that but playing the actual game is fun LUL
go to the bathroom "oops I forgot to split" Kappa
we are talking about getting a PB but hating the run so you dont split at the end lol
how dare you bismrich the doggo by comparing it to Arbok
y'all got any more of them drugs?
I missed it, wtf did you catch to give a ton of levels?
ah, I thought that might have been the case, but wasn't sure
My Starmie died on Dragonite today so that was fun
well executed you finish post Blaine in 1hr 1 min
that is with same strats
dasb and ninetales do
but youre not in range
There is a way to make your pokemon good that you simply don't do
Sway starmie would just win
BUT YOU GOT ONYX
wasthere even a reason to include mega stones?
I just want megas back in actual games
I want mega banette back
Yea megas for pseudos or legendaries was dumb
But like for mawile and things like that was hype
oh wait! they needed to make the game easier
mega absol was like the angel of death LUL
Are you excited for the kirby game that is just ball fall guys
oh UK gets it that cool i guess
what about me tho?
That's just the one that was on my TL
RF5 on pc tomorrow tho
that's the big release
when is xeno 3
So might end up getting another room at 2dcon
There's blazblue so jibca is coming the whole weekend
And we want to bring jaemi
So that'd be fucking 8 in the current room if buff00n shows up LOL
battle network 5 bugs
meant to google search on trez
I am going to fight this fucking bot
i love lai's note emotes says "hot take"
I think buff00n is more likely to show up after this game list got shown tho cause they have 3rd strike
yeah you have to hover over it with ffz to read it
I open coneys chat and the first message says "Open those cheeks"
It has rained with terrible winds 3 times today and gone back to being perfectly clear
11/16 range on dragonite let's go
i had 131 sp atk earlier it was glorious
Coneys kid came in and the whole chat wants her to PotFriend
Are you gonna pb with this terrible ass starmie
I did miss that range earlier, but I cleaned it up with Rapidash just to preserve Eevee PB
yea 8th, 9th, 10th on the eevee board is going to be 3:05:01, 3:05:02, and 3:05:03
lol, the scariest Hydro Pump ever
who broke the egg
how tall is it?
Both Morph and M4 are live
wait is that a positive nature for spattack too
weedMario 0 SpAtk IV

omg power wash simulator has an update
I watch that game like a hawk when it comes to updates
of course I want to powerwash more things
I have 41.9 hours in it
just waiting to wash more things
joycons not your style?
y i k e s
tho I have smaller hands so it probably wouldnt bother me too much
Would you believe me if I told you this is the first video I ever see of this game?
this game needs to update faster goddam
you know what else is a good game. House Flipper
THERES A NEW MAP YAAAAS imma wash
I am loving those remixes
did you remember to pay your speedrunner union dues?
good idea or not?
streamer I was watching it in their overlay
that's how I found it
just saying how I found it
could try asking Wartab about it
oh duh! you know how to do that stuff LUL
yeah, I saw the guy link you
haven't touched bn5 today so need to get on that
well, I need to go home first
I need to finish playing BN3...
and Jeny wants me to do Mitzi's rando with her
bn5ds is so bad tho
folder edits are fucking God awful
you swap chips with touch
you'll love navi change
basically you can have copies of your team Navistar follow you and aid in fights, you tap you do a navi change. they can randomly jump in for combo atks AND team navis have their own simplified navicust
it's really cool for pvp tho
And you have team attacks whenever the leading Navi switches while in Full Synchro
also you can only have 2 navis at a time
Well 3 with Megaman
and in liberation you get transport chips. so if you play colonel you can swap knight for magnet for the rest of the mission
You can swap Meddy in for ToadMan Kappa
it had some cool idea but the damn menus were aweful
also it take 30 seconds to save EVERY SINGLE TIME
Don't remind me xD
my gba file of colonel got wipe
I think Diamond was my second most played Pokmon game
and if you have a wiped cart you auto get bass cross on DS with the double slot
@Axl_Sensei BassCross is pretty good
no you get it!
so I have free bass cross
It came to X Dive recently, and I was shocked at how faithful it was to the movie and the game
intended is you need bass icon on gba
I think Capcom did the most with the GBA slot on the first DS
After Nintendo of course
movie is super fun, Lan and megaman do PA infinite Vulcan to break thru a firewall
that's right, Kojima is nuts
Right, Konami had some stuff with Lunar Knights and Castlevania
I know having Aria of Sorrow in while playing Dawn gave you a ring and a Mina doll appears in Yoko's shop
OMG theres ANOTHER level
im living my best life
i washed some big ass statue and now i get to power wash a nasty boat
okay I'm back, anything stupid happen?
oh yesterday went really good
had fun with laichan
went to a driver range in orlando
expensive as fuck too
between driving, food, alcohol it ran us 170 bucks axlsenCoward axlsenS axlsenWut
but I didn't have alcohol cause I had to drive G
next time I'll call Mitzi to be my designated driver OMEGALUL
actually as far as streamers/discord lurking is the closest
we actually met at gdq 2020
pasta is too long sadly
Why do I have to DD? D:
Alcohol may be nasty but with enough peer pressure i will consume it
how else could I trust while intoxicated
We can just use an uber Kappa
Uber for 1 hour driver axlsenS
actually maybe not, Florida drivers would scare poor mitzi
they should be scared of me
) I drive with one foot up on my seat
how do you reach the clutch?
i dont know hwo to drive stick
I keep forgetting you have that roll emote
oh ym god this boat im power washing is huge
camp4r has a roll emote but she's holding up a bag of zenny lol
I dont think so
Mitzi has a yacht POGGIES
I know nothing about boats
absolutely not I hate boats
Mitzi take us on a boat ride fifiShy
lakes and oceans are scary soup and boats go ON the scary soup.
S C A R Y S O U P
Jeny you can have the keys, I will stay on solid ground here with mitzi
yes Jeny can go on the boat without us have fun~
I went fishing once and I have not fished since :) what does that tell you?
Let me bring yall fishing. Im a pro
If anyone can make fishing fun it's Jeny sign me up
you have to put bait on my line, you can't pay me to touch that shit
but I dont wanna go on a boat
falling for youngster Timmy fifiBad
my god youngster timmy is a menace
someone call his parents
YEAH ground his ass
Come on streamer! I've seen better gameplay in an IGN review. Cheer100 Cheer100
im gonna save the rest of this boat for when im high
save it for jade jungle
cause high me will appreciate cleaning this boat more LUL
oh my god LUL
LuL Pikachu has its priorities. The berry first
food THEN wherever that draft is coming from
"oh hey, I found this hing in your hair"
you know I wish the rivals were actual rivals and not friendly. Like BE MY ENEMY
I dont want to kiss my rival correct
that sounds like hell
I wanna kick him in the shin and take his pokemon
show em how a real trainer would treat them clintNo
thank you axl phanto274Jam
phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam Axl thank you!!!!!
one of my faveee jam emotes phanto274Jam
my favs are rischJAM phanto274Jam komari1JAM argickJam
now kick him in the shin
yesterday I got a kirby game!!
Ooooh Axl thats cool
phantom ill give you a hint
its a kirby game not played on nintendo
if nintendo is gonna do physical rewards for us collecting points the least they could do is pay for shipping. How much could it b to shipping a fucking notepad!?!?
THE HOTTIE THOTTIE WITH A NAUGHTY BODY!!!
I shared a dank meme in Jeny's discord LUL
I just saw that now Axl lol
Lan, are you... drinking hydrogen peroxide? It says H202! That means it's the sequel to water!
I really hope the bn collection has new humor
I feel like usually the pokemon are spawning like crazy in caves
whats going on game >:(
just saw a thumbnail titled "kirby isnt made by nintendo" and im like, "I cant believe kirby was made by the company shown at the beginning of every single kirby game."
lurking said he got trnarrw on his first fight
i went to his vod
he missed a counter 3 times
the 1 counter he did get raised it to rank 5 KEKW
at least thats my head canon
or it could be melmetal
youtube short: top 5 rarest n64 games - "Do you have any of these?" Me: yup, on my everdrive KEKW
whats a good sky gauntlet? sub 1:20?
what if it was 9% chance that it fails?
you have bad luck with lures
it's a good way to get used to the new controller
you race ill drop 5 subs
@Axl_Sensei do I get the same offer? COPIUM
phantom, thanks for not calling my buff, I gifted 10 to Jeny last night LUL
I might not even join the race LUL
jameike, risch and lurking might tho
where is the game over audio from?
ive never actually asked lol
Phantom Board go crazy
I've never heard of that SpongeBob game in my life
lurking likes the idea of cutscene skipless runs, so I told him to go first
power shock final bowser!!
bot being a chad
did I tell you about the bn collectors edition idea I had?
it would come with 1 key item from each game. bn2 would be a bottle of whiskey LMAO
key items my guy
bn3 would be the hidden key item from number trader
but legit, it would be cool if they included a physical Lan's headband
im thinking of bn1 items and only thing that comes to mind is squirt gun
bn2 whiskey bn3 dads asprine
yeah, bn3 has 81 items but most are data
like the undernet ranks
sounds like that would cost me a lot of channel points KEKW
I could do it blindfolded
we have needle from shellgeek axlsenCoward
theres a needle PA too
BN2 could do the balloon item lol
bn4 can come with a shovel!!
it took risch 4 runs to get to central 2 LMFAO
I have a dalus clip I think you like
still using the hit box?
risch's time is just 3 minutes ahead of you, its basically a race!
YOU FORGOT KEY DAYTA OMEGALUL
he missed trnarrw 50/50
and then missed the 1 in 6 getting refltr
risch only has 1 more hour of resets in him
pc kept going to sleep while I was waiting on emails, so I played one of your youtube vods to keep it active
it wasnt logged into a youtube account so dont know if it counts LMAO
seed 49, that shit was trash
you started with bombette
you couldnt do panels until you got ultra hammer lmao
megaman be zigging and prog be zagging
first run past diveman today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
told risch we got a 35:45 diveman "its not an 'aweful' run" 4Head
you have to consider...
he thinks youre using the hit box Kappa
I have been ok
I have 4 days off work because my station is being quarantined
bruh... if you saw my webcam during your heatman fight....
I took 3 test and they all got negative so I am good
I was legit rocking back and forth laughing OMEGALUL
its better for me to clip for risch then just tell
also clip ran out at turn 3 selection so didnt see it in turn 4
its better that way
you said slot 234?
tomorrow Im going home for half the day so I can actually stream
komari wants bn5, but I havent touched pape in a while
I could do either bn5 is only to numberman rn tho
he just made a comment about your clip
Need to go lay down as I'm a bit tired, but hope you get and draw TrnArrow this time rischSmile
ASMR [Another Shitty Megaman Run]
one thing youll love about bn2, there is only 1 "talk to everyone"
its in scenario 3 at the square
shadow is 3 in bn5 got those mixed up
just to be different/
bruh... these title puns I have in my notes LUL
scenario 2: Mining For Trouble - This Comp Rocks
80% change of Being Cloudy
the clouds in oran and scilab net
Journey to the Center of the Undernet
ive seen fatkid die to that fight
Mother just called on the phone, "What are you doing all day?" thats not me, thats twitch lol
with bn5 im having to break habits
like holding start to skip cutscenes, stretching sneakruns [step counter doesnt reset like im used to] and pressing select to skip cutscenes
also I found out why i kept soft resetting
yeah, I map start to L so I can hold start and B for running
I'm confirmed for let's make big moves are u going to it.. say yes
Jan 6 and 8
u have plenty pf time
so apparently I had a power button mapped next to select LUL
most of the rockman.exe sound box is in japanese but someone song titles are in english like Surge of Power!
but I can read the titles that are in katakana
like with bn5 the boss music is literally pronounced Powerful Enemy but it takes me a minute lol
I mentioned the name bidwar to george for the popup event and he already said to just give him names to put since they can't do the usual thing
So I think I'm in the marathon lol
I should prolly start practicing windwaker but I also just grabbed hitman 2 for 10 bucks on steam
I wanted to get all of them but the site only had a cheap code for 2
so I will just wait for more sales
Cause I already played all of them I just want it on pc
and 2 is the best one anyway
Yakuza goes on sale constantly
I also already donated a bit to the gorescue tiltify since they already put it up
bidwar save the goombario or kill the goombario
people are actually considering N1GP%for bn3?!?
You can also just randomly be handed him
so you can't kill him always
why not have a gutsman% then
reset and get it
PET% time when Lan picks up his PET LMFAO
not with that attitude
its fine, cause bass is pretty difficult that early on
at least id assume its hard
the thing for me is if its a short run it needs skill for me to validate it
or some kind of tech
what do you think of bn2 drop the bass?
Someone came into wariocord and asked how to beat zard as d3
bass isnt even hard just run heatball LMAO
do you know how the ball chips work?
its a slow moving projectile and when hit it absorbs the dmg and once it makes it to the end or hits an object it explodes doing the dmg to each panel on that side.
I'm glad there wasn't a gamble
also remember how busted dash is?
it can destory it LMAO
why is hitman 2 almost 40gb
I have 500 down I was confused why it wasn't installed yet and now I understand loll
Megaman Attack% time when Megaman hits Sunayama!!
i did a soap cake once and felt so unsatisfied
mostly for me it was, "hey ive learned to chapter 4, lets do a soapcake... okay never doing that again"
IL? is that like a segmented run?
NeonWhite I think already has segments for each chapter
And IL's are just displayed in game
persona speedrunners would like to have a word with them
I've watched 6 P5r runs
it was a lot of hours of content
Im more into vanilla P5
I think the current WR for fullgame is 45 minutes
The only IL I've grinded is the one I have top 15 for
The rest I just wanted the medals
I want to get back top 10 for that level
But it kills my wrist to grind that shit
The first second of the level I have to do 3 precise flicks
someone uploaded some videos of a "bn1 ss wr speedrun" that is supposedly 1:27, but there's only video up to the stoneman fight, and they can't find anything else and they are discussing how suspicious it is
Sometimes the floatiness feels annoying in that game but in levels where you have to hit flicks like that I appreciate it because I couldn't handle more LOL
nah, the link is locked. I dont even have access to it.
opinion of stream teams
I used them a long time ago but its pretty useless now
MN smash twitter is just everyone fishing for DN jokes now and I am no longer going to respond to anyone
you hate to see it
last atk being a counter hit
do you know how to say fish in Japanese?
yeah, sakana deez nuts
Phantom I just talked about DN jokes and not responding to people
Now you've been had
@TacoGuyy you gave me the idea Kappa
you will never recover
hey phantom, go to google translate, punch in fifty ten hull and have audio say it in french
or you could just try to say it here... cinquante dix coque
komari forget dark mega fights, these heatman draws is where its at!!!
its content, but only for us
stop posting my credit card numbers
I wanna see if my birth date gets you anything
what if Eguchi's birth date is a hidden lotto code?
could be 16111978, don't know how the Japanese write dates
also I feel that, I also listen to audio cues for lotto codes LUL
Evo is doing restreams rn and there's xrd on and I fucking hate fausts throw
@Komari_ doesnt work in bn5 sadge
He just makes you sit there so long and you just have to accept it
and then he licks you
He just does stupid shit but it's a genuinely top tier character lolll
oh, now that the bn collection is happening I should prob unban the word collection from my chat now KEKW
if it's in healwater that's good enough
I put on multiple write in slots for the strive survey to add more specials
I will get my pin back
we got tired of hearing that topic day in and day out
Depends on what they add for the specials they pick
If they give me back secret garden I would also take that
"what does this chip do?"
Holy shit the top 8 for the evo they're showing is 7 jp and 1 us player LUL
"WHO IS THAT?! WHERE DID HE COME FROM!?!?"
it was on that encounter
cause I wont let you forget KEKW
Man I miss having a good 6k
Strive 6k is so fucking ass
while you were waiting on your next draw I was admiring the sprite work on the flames from heatman's wrists
Xrd 6k was actually a good overhead and got disc and strive 6k is 28 frames and gets me a lustshaker :)
gonna let dogs out, dont do anything stupid
oh shit hitman actually installed when did that happen
ima go shoot people
I wanna see you do the stupid stuff
there's only one grass you should touch
gotta get in on the HackJack memes
yosh, caught a Phantom stream
dog took a massive shit in my brothers room and pissed in there too
have you seen that clip
"Rockman Exe Advanced Collection" [Music player] Contains the BGM of all 188 songs used in the game! You can also listen to your favorite songs in repeat mode or set them as BGM on the gallery screen. Let's enjoy famous songs to your heart's content!
Or I could just listen on spotify LUL
first reply in japanese says... I don't know if it will reach the development department, but I would like to ask you to change the BGM after the final scenario.
I hope rockman unity sees it
I saw "BMG" wonder what this says 4Head
japanese players are asking for the same things as us. even pvp
How's the controller feeling?
Switching mashing techniques is always rough
Like, I can't mash well on keyboard at all
don't you play osu tho? Kappa
In hindsight, I kinda can mash on keyboard
Just not as fast as I can on controller in terms of pure speed
I did always think using a hitbox for BN runs would be interesting, especially for runners who already use keyboard
it seems too expensive for me LUL
Ash calling his pikachu "Pikachu" is like me calling my dog "Dog"... or would it be more like calling my dog "Shiba"?
Probably calling it Shiba, yeah
It is kinda weird when there are multiple pokemon all with the same name, at least in the anime
Gbeast 1 turn again?
Yeah... HeatMan's charge shot hits first and causes iframes sadly
The game told me to make a loud distraction
So I fucking exploded a car
and the guard I had to make move just didnt care and it was 10ft away
Stop with the "there is NO GLITCH" category crap. Anyone who uses a glitch to speedrun is lazy, sucks at gaming, and is not a speedrunner. Saying he "beat" BOTW is like saying someone won the Boston Marathon when their BFF picked them up in a car a mile in and drove them to the finish line. The only LEGITIMATE SPEEDRUN is where someone doesnt use a glitch. And, that one needs to label "SPEEDRUN FOR REAL MEN WHO DO NOT USE PUSSIFIED GLITCHES!!"
Warp whistles are CHEATING
why didnt you vulcan at the end? he only had 20 LUL
right here, sorry stream is delayed KEKW
kekw means im telling the truth
these fight remind me of metaruler streams lol
Hai hai. Speaking of copium. Yesterday was my birthday.
I'm older now. >:I
Or so I'm told.
I had chocolate milk. So, it was an okay birthday.
save 2 minutes? that means a run back LUL
did you check retro tag? Kappa
took 6 games for MegaMan/Hub to be able to hug his mum
look at this Rando Randy weedMario
time for the Rando sNeed
do something else if you want
i dont care as long as its cool
I like traps because its really funny when you talk to an npc and they just strike you with lightning
I'll make you start at Prologue
PhantoBot activated the spell card, Sword and Shield
ive seen coinsanity seeds on yt
So glad to finally catch a stream! been binging your randos on YouTube. love your content!
do traps only spawn disguised as good items
Anti Guy is still looking like he's going to hurl
phanto274Shrug love this emote. l0l
in my personal opinion, on casual playthroughs, he's harder than bowser sometimes. but again, I'm very casual with this game. lol
can't wait to see another use on mystery?
have you checked star summit yet for the star pieces?
I was literally watching your randomizer from two days ago. Im new to your channel and Im quite a fan
@inoahhowtoparty same here! phantom does amazing! I'm quite a fan of his as well.
is that a salktydkdan reference?
that's very convenient because I work full time during the week, so I'll be able to catch the streams on the weekend! win win!
I have no idea
should've used that mystery stickshamChaos
what's the worst that can happen?
that was honestly nerve wracking for me. lmao
I would've died 10x over. lol
Beeg Yosh gave you the world
odd key in a odd sNeed
a pure scam artist. lmao
scraping the bottom of the barrel
3fp mega bomb incoming?
Can the frozen pond in Ch7 be a progression item?
3fp powerbomb is good too! that's what I meant. not megabomb. lol
Pog I made it at the beginning
Mario breaking and entering
I couldn't wait any longer!
hopefully its arson guys
I DIDNT KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT
I've died to that big Koopa guy more than I care to share.
i first tried him xd
maybe because I didnt know about him until after chapter 7
place your bets chatters
Just got home from the gym, stomach feels like its gonna eat itself. Gonna find something to munch on
fuck its mt rugged
this song has been stuck in my head for 2 weeks
my favorite song is toad town docks stickshamGaslight
i like general guys theme
what's the secret to beating those things disguised as rocks?
I always get ran into by them and haven't figured out how to beat them, so I always just run from them.
time to feed gourmet guy?
are you saying you're wanting to skip the best part of the game?
that is one of my favorite parts of this game. his reaction to the cake is so good.
but not after gourmet guy gets fed
are there any checks at Mario's house
the vanilla toy box experience
wait did you get rid of mystery?
The lad and chad
he's got some great Cardio to be running like that. lmao
if believe hard enough, happy flower can be a partner
Kris be spittin fax
flashbacks to when I accidentally solved the color puzzle without the note
so, in a casual playthrough, who is the best character to have in your opinion? like most useful I guess.
a friend gave me a good amount of her alcohol. This is AFTER I just bought some alcohol earlier
I've always relied on parrykarry with his shell shot or whatever.
buff00n go find some Hard Baja Blast
there's actually Seltzer Baja Blast that was made officially
@buff00n that reminds me I have some alcohol to give you
I'm waiting for a few friends to get back to me so we can go have some beers. lol. I need out of my house.
but I am also content right now watching your stream. so I'm happy either way. lol
you must be very excited! that's awesome to hear!
chapter 3 my beloved
this forest took me like an hr to get through casually.
I enjoyed this chapter a lot definitely my favorite
not a clue. lmao. but I did accidentally come across one of them I think.
keeping the mystery for memes? xD!
I really like that part where you hit the 3 switches
idk why i just like it
are those panels in vanilla?
i know where all the hidden chests are in smrpg but thats because i ran what must have been like 50+ randomizers
its open world like paper mario
get back in there goombario
I'll chat for this :)
Leavin the goat FeelsBadMan
SMRPG rando is a lot shorter than pm64
it's a lot of equipment searching, and that can lead to a few party members balling out of control
every boss is randomized and their stats scale to the area you fight them in
ffvi is pretty similar, yeah
and also every star piece is randomized so you could get one after hammer bros etc
but you need seven stars to beat the game
badges have been brutal in this seed andyRage
don't feed the Yoshi's
LISTEN. The last map is really big I can only do like 10% at a time
im playing power wash simulator rn man dont scare me like that
a fellow power wash sim player
you love to see it
its a GREAT game
SquareEnix's weirdest but best selling game so far
it's always the ultra stone
the dev is called, FuturLab
weird that Square of all people published it tho
Coinsanity is really fun in toy box/mt rugged and really annoying most other places
ive played through so much of power wash simulator
I have the best washer and I have not used soap once because im not WEAK
you got all the magic sNeeds
i want MOLES i want MOLES
you instinctively picked that up like a moth to a flame
imagine if you need bubble berry
i want the legendary moles coin
oh nice a tasty tonic you can give that to koopa koot
kill the crayzee dayzee too
they never hurt anyone
He's actively hiding from you
my last pm randomizer bombette had a 1FP Bomb
it started strong for you
the seed for the weekly async was pretty goated
just burn your console at that point
why does mario suck his thumb when he uses a drink item? does he slather the liquid he drinks on his thumb and then drink it? WHO KNOWS?
I lost almost an hour in the async yesterday because I forgot check :)
I still got a 4:16 funny enough
what is the function of koopas having shades in this game
How random has it been
we know in super paper mario they wear shades because theyre hypnotized
Thats not a good sign
bowser hypnotizes his workers because he doesnt want to give them a fair wage
it's a gang thing for sure
No laki and no paracarry thats a little
what do you mean by that
where do you want it?
do I leave Pie-os' message above it?
single white mom in illinois
that is so specific
personally ive never seen one so the bot could be right
so is the bot just random? or what is it there for? because that shit was hilarious. lmao
So thats how the Stanley Parable ends?
the bot is random
Hey look who it is
KEKW well thats convenient
oh hey I have that game
this seed is torture
hey bot, learn THIS
MOLES MOLES MOLES MOLES MOLES
wait so you're saying that your bot... is an amiibo
co-op run, but I'm alone Sadge
20 years from now it will be known as unethical punishment
@rigby235 I feel that. lol
happened to me like last week lmao
If MOLES has million number of fans i am one of them . if MOLES has ten fans i am one of them. if MOLES have only one fan and that is me . if MOLES has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth . if world against the MOLES, i am against the world. i love #MOLES till my last breath
man hot cheetos are so good
im eating some rn
I dont like hot chips
hot things are the best
cheetos are meh. but hot cheetos are fine
Hot Cheetos/Lime Hot Cheetos are good when you don't put them in other things
my burrito will be crunchy
that sounds kinda fire
Burritos arent supposed to be crunchy tho
alright I'm leaving that's actually the last straw
kinda flaming hot, perhaps
i can understand chips on a burger but not a burrito
putting Hot Cheetos/Hot Doritos in regular food is wrong, it's as Shrimple as that shrimpsDrip
Oh have you had fat shack before?
let me just post one of their sandwiches
FAT DOOBIE Chicken fingers, french fries, onion rings, mozzarella sticks & honey mustard
where's Tacoguyy when you need him?
if you think Cali sucks, don't go to North Dakota. lol. nothing to do here but drink.
FAT MAVERICK Mac n' cheese, chicken fingers, french fries & bbq sauce
@PerMitzi That sounds nice af
all their sandwiches are wild
that honestly sounds delicious.
ew what did I just hear?
carbs are my best friend <3
All of that with no bacon sounds great actually
I think I'll just stick to pilk thank you very much
shit that fat maverick sounds great
OH how about this one
FAT GORBIES Bacon, chicken fingers, french fries, cheddar cheese sauce, lettuce & ranch
i have no idea lemme check
is this gonna be like one of your last runs and not find kooper until like the end? lmao
washington, oregon, nevada, colorado, kansas, texas... and more so no they are not colorado exclusive
I never heard of it but I'm in a far off country
on their website they have all their locations
all of their deserts are deep fried
200 S Jackson St Seattle, WA 98104
OH? i see fatshack in your future
I will sub if you find goombario
I will gift if you actually pick him up
goombario is taking some much-needed time off
they have deep fried oreos, twinkies, cheesecake bites, and chocolate chip cookies
If Goombario has a million fans I am one of them. If Goombario has ten fans I am one of them. If Goombario has only one fan, that is me. If Goombario has no fans, that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Goombario, I am against the world.
hes been got got
a deal is a deal
rosie literally NEVER has anything good
I can't believe I spent 2 subs on Shrimpcam and PhantoBot
but they were entirely worth it shrimpsDrip
Why does the hammer make that sound
damn this seed really is bad
oh wow~! a rock!
I got a rock
kooper stuck in a tree poor guy
How many maple syrups do you need
just poor it down his pants
you can fit more that way
you should open the ruins
you're already here no? Kappa
you can trust mitzi with anything (except for anything related to splits)
Strange leaf? Thats uhhh
this guy really just pulls his friend outta the sand
like wow he was just chillin down there
wish someone would pull me out of the sand
2 more checks then ruins :)
trust me, I done this seed
Rigby has done every seed
I'm retired from speedrunning and rando is my retirement home
laki was in ruins Sadge
2CoolJonathan go get em
I had a seed once where I decided to glitch and laki was in ruins basement
so couldn't cheat ruins
turn that frying pan into a drying pan
OH MY GOD BoatRide
I once laughed at it for like an hour
where did you find the piss bucket?
Mario got away with murder
i havent seen any traps
i would like more please :)
i would like more please :)
if I didnt see it.. it didnt count
mitzi has to see it for anything to count
so you better hope she sees you grab the star rod or this rando is invalid, buster
that needs to be a quote
"I'm one damage short"
mitzi does not PikaPls
I have the power to watch
imagine if you had the block that
same. blocking that is the g4eatest achievement one can have in pape
im back what happened
we added a quote thats what happened
you picked up goombario?
phantom didn't block monstar so we are peepoLeaving
he was exploring with Kolorado and got lost, obviously
did you check where the star stone is yet
good I wanna see the legendary item
yeah I'm gonna start doing that for that reason
this fight wouldn't be bad if we started with anyone other than kooper
but ill mega shock the fight if I have access to it
yeah if you start with goombario the fight is leagues easier
it tastes like heaven itself
do I go buy a chicken sammich w/ fries and a shake?
O K A Y
I left for a few minutes, but did you get anything from the 4 or 5 items at the toads inn?
the keys man the keys
hey phantom! what did i miss?
i missed a lot then
did you get a chance to look at the big chest shuffle seeds
you would deprive an old woman of her trusty frying pan???
it is good item lol
officer it's this one right here
what if the pan gives tubba key so it quicker?
tubba key in boo is a trap
frying pan was clearly ultra stone
i would love if they could put traps in shops
YOU PAY FOR THE PAIN
i heard the hammerless start seed of the big chest shuffle test seeds to be quite painful, so maybe not that one
wAIT where was laki
... ruins? i knew it Kappa
i would've pinned it if i was able to lol
slow go spot would be ultra stone
or it would be slow go
it will be slower go
would be funny if you can buy a bomb from shop :)
not sure what's the issue with traps in shops, but clover said to not do it ... yet
or so I've heard
randomized star sprites when?
beating a boss should be a key item if they rando star
one suggestion that could work is decoupling saving star spirits from gaining star power
not like star power is that essential tho
it would be better if the card had goombario on it
if you do another seed can i change the settings up a bit lol
i saw rig do that
we should race a seed phantom. we haven't done that in a while and I'm willing to glitch
those seeds do have the race seetings as base thos
yo cats how are you
good and u :)
I'm doing alright. I might do a seed myself in a little bit so preparing for that
ill try to hop by
no worries if you can't make it. I played the extreme async terribly yesterday so I want to redeem myself
phantom you forgot diamond stone!
no diamond stone was MOLES
did u save baby yoshis
what did u get
if u return a pan u will get a ultra stone :)
if not ultra it will prob be diamond stone bc u dont have it yet
mario likes the smell of the bed
y run? y not just use bow and hide until tubba looses mario
hes not dead yet
this is gonna be close
barely pulled that off
do u have mystery for bowser? it now a key item or u cant beat bowser
dont come crying to me when youre missing diamond stone
fishShy the fuck is this LUL
shy fish is shy
never seen it before lol
I owe everything to MOLES
I love block puzzle
Nice 1 FP Spiny Surge
ima head out bc i got to do stuff
They could do with speeding up this a wee bit
hi i love pape how does randomizer work
oh youre at end game hallway
is soft locking common?
gl with the runs clintThot
what hp does he heal
thats kinda fucky LOL
brain why not work
but yeah makes sense. its like a ratio
hopefully we dont get a 3rd heal lol
yup that's the one
they are not vetted except for "upgrades not 100% vanilla
wake me up when MOLES
last 2 seeds at moles :)
Uh, I'll have to ask Pronyo about stats
While he gave me a crash course on our server stuff ... he only gave me a crash course on our server stuff lol
so is big chest shuffle exactly what it sounds like
thats kinda neat i guess
probably more homeward shrooming lol
the hammers at MOLES
I think the hammerless seed has the highest required sphere count I've seen so far
Yeah I'm still waiting on it being required. But that needs oddkey and bombette and sushie early
opposite of last seed andyLUL
just for you buddy
colonel was a dumpster fire
reset 6 times just to get zenny for 1st hp memory
main comp didnt give me zenny for mine key
so I grinded gmd in oran
then I got to the mine key and was 50 zenny short lmao
dw nobody does lol
yeah the ones before the ultraboots chest
thats really cool boots and hammer is shuffled
icebound and team doing God's work
it's testing seeds. not for the features itself, but for whether we want the sewers blocks gone or yellow or stone
so first hammer is anywhere?
okay so the bust could be super boots maybe
Welp, not partner starved this time
so if this is one of the pracctice seeds I should watch then LUL
I still haven't done 3 and 4 yet
When is the race again?
I'm planning on doing the race
if im home ill do the race
Hmm, I might be calling a Majora's Mask Rando during that.
I wanted to do last week but I fell asleep
We're in qualifiers to our Season 3 tourney right now, yeah
need to getting ready, ill be back within the hour
I want to get into more randos
since apparently I'm a rando streamer now
im slowly getting there
zelda rando are the shit
I wanna submit more randos to events. maybe do extreme rando next time
you should do DK64 rando OMEGALUL
z3 has an incredible rando
we need a BN rando that actually deals with logic. more than just the chips/viruses.
its not open enough
Both Ori games have randos
i actually came from z3 rando. i felt the world needed more randos and joined the pape community then
z3 as in link to the past?
that's the best rando out there imo
z3 or oot multiworld are *chef's kiss*
I did a couple with the intent of joining tournaments once I got better but never did
I also have classic so I mostly use that
I've watched so much Andy's YouTube vods that it's like the back of my hand
I watched a lot of vods and stuff too, I just suck still lmao. I should give it another shot tho
One day I will have 69.42 million phantokens
Wow, early heavy weapons
Wait, I can actually read the game
Yeah its usually in Japanese
Whoops, yeah the pouches are wrong, I'll have to adjust a local preset I use
Also, what the heck is up with Pape Racers and chests? Toad is showing his RAC like 10 times a week, now youre shuffling big chests
Pffft, I'd have preferred it
you're the first to notice tho
Also great pickup line: want to see me shuffle some big chests?
that is always the case
one thing that's kind of meh with big chest shuffle IMO is that upgrades easily combo into other big chests
it gets spicier with hammerless start tho
can't wait for the first person to have ultraboots but still be hammerless lol
that diamond stone is fake I know where the real one is
yeah yeah, the wall is already removed in our base mod dev branch lol
you can full clear it partially
Lucky 3-0'd the greninja that esam lost to at combo breaker at this regional lol
Imagine thinking mii brawler is top 10 and then it does worse than a pplant
Loaf 3-0'd colorondo nice
Fuck that matchup lol
It's not bad because inkling can't fucking kill wario but it's just not fun
that is a good reward if you didn't know how to do glitches
That's a thing now?
Thirty4 is shitting on this falcon lol
why the fuck did they see him 13th
ive never seen that
Man MN plays all top tiers and good chars but like
They didn't pick any fun ones >:(
Our best 3 players are olimar megaman and wario
The single person who picked fun ones was Violet and he plays joker/sheik
I actually enjoy fighting joker
He's an actually cool top tier and the shit he does besides occasional charizard back air without lag is cool
Pre down gun nerf
That shit was pain
He just got to land
and I had to say ok
Man lucky has a good chance to have to play the person he already lost to at the start of top 8
Plant falcon sounds painful
where did you shove that cake sir
play the slot machine :)
whoever made the tracker must suck they should fix that
Oh also if lucky and loaf win their r1's for top 8 they play eachother
that only happens a few times a week so it's a pretty fresh mu
why did I add it
I'm not gonna remove it
But I'm mad I added it
it's not like we're releasing the next version any time soon, so you're good
they made it themselves
why do people need to ask which twin is which their hair is entirely different now and lucky has facial hair
I return after a nap
but not before acquiring a chicken sammich
If you ever mix them up in person they will just go along with it tho
that is the most annoying sound
@buff00n get me one
If you dislike that sound don't raid jcog
you owe me a chicken sandwich now
2 months I go again
Although combo breaker WAS 2 months ago
MWSF is gonna be lit tho
it's a flip's chicken sammich, not a Wendy's chicken sandwich
We can get another 100 dollars of portillos
we can go even closer to close this time for maximum employee hatred
I don't understand loafs bike usage
He throws it to plat on purpose
where you can never get it again
that is still the one thing I have over loaf
I will just play RPS around my bike and enforce the range where I get + frames
loaf hit a waft string thas crazy
no let me look
I can look at his logs 1 sec
" Master does better than his dick for sexual purposes and I'm pretty sure it wants you there by now" I think that's enough bot logs for now
Flip's chicken sandwiches > Portillo's chicken sandwichs
that is similar to a single white mother from illinois
does coinsanity add every coin in the open world to the pool?
so is big chest shuffle shuffling them between each other or between all checks?
so like bushes and stuff are checks too then
im gonna try one out and wasnt sure what all was in
loaf added another clip to failbots bad waft compilation and lost to the mario he beat at combobreaker
no way he was moustafa the whole time
ill br lurking HypeLurk
Whoever wins between kasmir and thirty4 just wins the tournament I think
Cause either of them shit on skittles
ages ago they said never =(
oh hey ice =P
It's not a development issue
It's a developer issue
yeah iirc you or someone else said that you guys didnt want it
some in the dev team really want it to happen, some really want it to not happen
im working on that ..
im crossing my fingers for the day =P
how else would you know the secret password
Time for lucky to play the same set he lost again
4123 is the passcode for 1-4 in sticker star
i think rando should randomize the bombette clones in ch7 :tf:
I want to take care of just my dog again
do you need to be in a certain state to laki jump
Why does falcon up smash
guess what happened phantom
ill need to look ive been trying to learn more broken stuff recently
same frame and thats it?
My partner swap button is on the cstick because pj64 mapping is ass
So I can't do that shit LOL
ye ive seen the bubble berry one and just never knew it was so simple lol
ive messed with clippy but dont really use it
might start after watching this temple lmao
lucky is planking this falcon with a 3 stock lead
item menu in battle messes it up too?
can confirm from reading source code. very well programmed. immaculate even
oop arctice rolled into plant up smash
he died uncharged at 65 from the floor
Plant has DLC ass moves but then they're on plant
Imagine ganon nair on wario drift
kooper was a sacrifice to the volcano
He calmed it down and you made it erupt
he was looking for his shell
see look it's exploding now
and how would I know that?
thats what she said
extra money? Whats the enchange rate from coins to zenny?
man bingleton coochiesmith lost right after pools
they won a tripoint when I was in vegas I watched it LOL
It was on when I was just playing against buff00n so I put it on the laptop
Ikan was in the chat just saying his tag over and over
sees banjo is trending, "oh cool! what happened?"
Steve Martin does his banjo thing and gets 100k+ likes.
this song is screaming "smoke weed everyday (everyday)"
I'm heavily debating calling in to work tomorrow and not going
I've felt exhausted for the past few days and I felt lightheaded at work today
Yea I just always feel bad when I call in even if I do need it
Although I guess we were out of like any sale item today so the shift wouldn't be bad to deal with for whoever ends up going in
thoughts on speedrun survivor?
Cause at first I thought it was because I didn't eat then I grabbed a sandwich at work and still felt it so idk
oh you havent seen it?
the last person to PB on speedrun survivor gets kicked off the island
I ahve no idea what it is either I'm just saying shit
4thgengamer is hosting it
is that actually what it is LOL
thats basically it lol
4 new runners with coaches
can I run pokepark
well of course! if its josh it HAS TO BE pokemon
when I went to gdq one of my friends introduced me to josh
And I said, "4thgengamer? So you speedrun SNES games?"
jr was in kent c koopa shell

i will go get food also
Ok I got someone to cover me tomorrow now I'm gonna go pass out

u could get it from gifts
goombario is a good gift
luigi is the real kooper
its ruby king this time
did u beat black pit?
u need to go back to black pit and beat it
the ending is great
lil oink rando when lol
u would use it for 1 rando
never seen that glitch before
so the loading zone is always there?
found u from fatguy vid on yt into me searching rando on yt into me finding ur cahnnel and watching 10 randos and then going to twitch and remember to watch u
that nightmare seed vid with the 20k views tho
bad thumbnail = lots of viewers
when will the moment come when you pick up all the coins and star points from running
Im here to bring back old memories...
u missed 1 when u ran
mario still likes the smell of bed
the boo's just have bad timing
wonder how they live... well live while being dead with that
if u edit videos u put on yt u will get more veiwers
bc i would watch every vid but it just takes to much time
yeah burning out is very easy
is there a Daisy recolor?
Wth was that luck
when u can fire?
y is a goomba on ship?
we never had a goomba partner
check moles it gives an advantage in the race
ive been right about moles 100% of the time
i just got behind on some house things so catching up today haha
are the seeds custom made for the race or do they generate them
I'm seeing chat stuff from last stream
@Phantom5800 i love moles
wait, how much FP for Bomb
to my knowledge ive never given any hints that I like moles
feeling fine badge :D
i feel like i know where they are now, it's having to do 5 jumps to remember EXACTLY where they are LUL
so with no hammer seed the bush will never have normal hammer cause super hammer is required to reach prologue
that sounds really rough
how dare you throw away that potato
where are the 4 seeds at in the discord?
@Axl_Sensei toad town, mt rugged, jade jungle, and forever forest
is that just vanilla LOL
the key was in the lime tree
fuck you I was about to make that joke
this rat bastard stole the lime
make sure to get the red jar for koopa koot
now you can see hidden blocks
@TacoGuyy i prefer the term stupid bitch
find some goodges then
what if that one merlow letter is required
was whacking whale added to the rando?
Not much, working on a new pokemon emerald hack
on my first playthrough when I beat chapter 5 I saved and then went to bed and when I got back on my save loaded at the docks before chapter 5 so I had to replay the WHOLE thing
so I hate fuzzipede
Yeah I made Kabutops and Aerodactyl their skeletal forms
Right now I'm working on making a mangrove marsh area
naming a fish sushie is like naming a pig baycon
thank you rip cheato
this is the best shop ever
coconut in a snowy area
im eating ramen so i wont talk for a bit
this is lip smacking good
why is that in the game
looking forward to bot stream
oh boy spear guys
everybody accidentally makes mistakes
they wouldnt be mistakes

without spicy mcchickens because this state fucking sucks
So we're getting mcdonalds when I'm there at some point I hope you're aware of that
Idc what food options are there you've shown me I'm getting a mcdonalds trip at some point
Oh also there's a giordano's in minneapolis now so we could get deepdish at MWSF if y'all wanted to
Don't listen to jesse that place is mad good
go to 4 and do check Kappa
you wont you coward fifiYell
Ok the giordanos is 13m from the venue according to google
So that's a cheap uber if buff00n doesn't come and a short drive if he does
what did phantom ghost have?
I just realized I never paid for 2dcon yet so uhhh lemme do that lol
I made an account for the website but never reg'd lol
You already know who it is, its your boy ererere
none of those words are in the bible
Just some random vid thats in my head rent free
Hows the rando looking
He is a zoomer through and through
Brett told me I gave off "I'm sick and tired of everything and everyone" energy
After I ranted to him for like 40 minutes about that stupid fucking toy story poster
Jesse has been sending me toy story gifs since that
I kinda wanna do another ww run but I don't feel like practicing right now and I need to do door clip
So I'm just gonna play hitman
I tried to do no casualty runs the other day but then I wanted to get all locations on the map and got tired of sneaking
So I just started going around with a shotgun to speed it up
And the map was closed enough with rooms to not die for it lol
My dad got me honey mustard pringles from Israel
I havent tried it yet
I clicked on the bts stream and saw anathema just bounce around with nair gyro and omega's response was rebels guard in the corner
So they died at 10%
Why do you respond to robs kill confirm being mashed at you by going into the spot where it kills you
Ever since he learned he could use emoji's for titles he's been putting out bangers
He has atrioc doing it now lol
Catglub is still like my favorite emote
kazamsCatglubhat he even gets a millia hat
Ok time to be a sneaky guy in hitman until I get tired of going slow and start using the loud shit
Also rune factory gave me multiple fucking cecil cards and fuuka cards and they could've literally given me any other chars and I'd be happy
Just gave me the 2 fucking chars I dont like
I don't even need a scarlet one just give me any cards that's not fucking cecil
pretty delayed pow block you asked for eh?
Forced double-dip chapter 6 KEKW
who gave you editor bot
we need to take that away that's too much power
yeah learning that fortress skip has made chapter 1 a joke lol
he's going to add more fresh
until something is in it, then it's not so funny
The record was in chapter 3 datrut1Pog
Damn fucking broke his ankles
key at moles :)
im 2 for 2
hands havent bothered me in awhile so trying bn5DS
starting protoman with bass cross
oh, i forgot they redid the aspect ratio
lan's sprite looks smaller to me, but I do play emu so it would be diffferent i guess
oh no, the hunt for the last fortress key
oh nice, so I get triple buster, +200Hp, super armor, but -2 megachips
quoting m4 from the discord:
I missed a magical seed or boo portrait (not sure which) and after looking for it for what felt like an hour i just didn't want to continue bc it wasn't fun
m4 forgot about snowmen gift and couldn't find the seed from there
this seed is mean. playing all nice with an early ultra stone, and now this
i got 3 stones on goomba king
went to get frozen custard with a friend, which morphed into also going for a walk with their dog and grabbing a burrito
well 25fp is kinda nice
i just noticed that haha
i need my 3 stones come on
all the worst checks had something of value, and the whole multi dipping left and right at the start, geez
before scilab visit I have 360 HP what is this!?
i don't recall, where was it
great metaphor for the seed, i agree
also ultrahammer before superboots is nasty
i'm all of a sudden not so sad i missed this week's race lol
also getting storeroom key from mt rugged, to get parakarry in the storeroom to enter ch2 lol
would cheating have helped much here? The fortress key hunt, sure, but else?
Where was KBF Key 4?
jade raven was prolog
if it makes you feel better about this seed, rigby lost a life shroom to goomba king lol
Wow, you 4 got up quick
you were both searching the last kbf keys until last
this guy won't die
oh I got an 8 cap on final lmao
granted I had dodge master
ohh right phase 1
I got double 4 phase one
Hmmm, anyone else see something wrong with that tracker?
i'm not ready to watch this again
Just messing with ya
and it has started lmao
can't fire myself really
You know, it makes sense. Megaton Hammer can break bombable rocks, so Bombette breaks hammerable trees
especially not on the playroom tree
So remember when I said earlier how I'd like to see altered item models for traps? For feeling fine, they need to open the eyes to make it look like the awesome face.
the worst is muscle memory of hammering items and then just standing there staring at it instead
you get more opportunities to appreciate your partner's abilities :)
"who needs friends if you have a hammer"
no bomb hitbox, nope :)
that was just the vanilla lyrics with extra steps
i wish i had sick colors for kammy
that could become useful
i would lie if i said i've never seen someone upgrade goombario in a rando, but ..
If I have ultra stone, ill do it for a charge/bounce subsitute on huff/ck if I dont have the badges
and I did it on hammmerless for the same reason phantom did lmao
truth be told, i was refering to the vod of your stream of this seed rigby lol
objectively the right choice to upgrade goombario in this seed i guess
Sushi is just showing how frighteningly slow no hammer is
just you wait for the no boots start where you can't even jump
You just need Sushie for Volcano hammer, right?
i mean, considering we're not doing US raph skip, you'd also need hammer
for the jungle logs
ah. could've meant laki for the lava
You only need one key for chapter one right?
And chapter one tends to be early in logic too so you normally have at least one key by the time you can actually do it
have you completed a run today?
oh nice how'd that go
@spagettd and it was literally for KBF small keys
I still havent seen a full randomizer run so idk how tedious it gets LUL
it's "Tedious: The Setting"
Just for the added challenge? spaget3Hmm
I warned ya, the seed is something else, even if you ignore the lack of B
In challenge do you mean challenge of patience, because that is all it really seems to do
haha I guess thats true
Important, but not useful
I see where this is going
ttyd has a randomizer too or not yet?
there's a few randos for ttyd, but not of the "logic open world" kind
Mario was a big strong man once. Now he is flat as fuck.
TTYD has one but its not like this
ahh okay, it's not at this level yet
the ttyd randos are pretty good IMO, they just go for something different
Its more like item randomizer and not key items from what I remember
one is for random pit of 100 trials, and one if for chaos entrance rando
Anywho, imma lurk myself to sleep. Have fun psykitPsycho7
Hammerless means we have to do this boss
hammerless means this boss is out of logic lol
Kaizo Paper Mario when. Partners die forever LUL
have you done ch3?
I just took out a 20 person squadron with some soda cans
I dont know what else it could be
and nobody saw me
You can still do record with glitches right?
Its just not in logic though
oh? not a fan
I havent been paying attention
42 minutes in and only that is telling
What are the other checks after this? Calculator and then what?
Maybe just do it later? For your sanity
And that wasnt even in logic
the last remaining check is behind tree near volcano, isnt it
@Icebound777 There is another...
So that means tree near volcano HAS something right?
Or not, but still worth to check
i really hate that we have situations where you can lock yourself out of useful glitches
I did all that work with my stash of soda cans just to chuck a bomb at the target and run away
Oh thats fair, and that couldnt have given laki anyways
nobody saw me still tho so I'm still a stealth god
You can also check Parakarry, you skipped a letter
You definitely did skip a letter
What letter was skipped?
It's on the beach
Thats not good though?
And you cant even get to the other letter right?
hammerless might be less painful with gear upgrades in the item pool, but you could still get seeds like this
The Weight could have been good depending on how the Big Chests are shuffled (because that's also a setting)
Sushi didnt even give any progression either
found shrek movie under speedrun tag - was from me, sorry guys
honestly id just be happy to know where the seed wants me to go
Thats sad if they made you get the Yoshis for progression
why cant you get pb?
you need a hammer? guess i should know that lol
Well now hidden blocks are in logic if that means anything
uh, tbh i can't recall trying that
Back to Chapter 3 YEP
You can get the Super Boots check too, right?
No you need weight for that
I'm finally giving in and I'm gonna buy FE
I didn't like DNF so I refunded that so I have extra for it
They wanted you to not have fun with this seed huh
may i requrest a short, one sentence review of this seed in the discord afterwards? lol
what happens if you leave through the panel when those nerds come out
If that was ultra boots
yo hammer one hour in let's gooo
you have goombario you already won
There's a seed go tear it apart with the hammer
what's the fp on the quake badges
holy shit I saw mario strikers on the eshop and I like
Entirely forgot that shit existed
Remember when people were begging for it for years and now look at it :)
it's almost like people then realize "oh wait it's a mario sports game it's the same shit every time"
yeah mario tennis aces really set the pace for that shit
when it first released it had nothing and barely functioned
Sucks cause the devs prolly try their best it just gets pushed out by the people in charge
I dont think thats a hot take tbh
Strikers had a top tier wario and I didn't buy it
mario golf wario tho yoshiGasm
I wouldve bought Strikers but it just felt barren
FWIW Strikers isn't developed by the same people as Golf/Tennis, not sure who's making the calls on the content though
Dude fuckin knives told me to buy golf and she'd play it a bunch and we played it a single time
@TacoGuyy same shit happened with me and Animal Crossing
the golf game is so fucking boring jesus christ
@buff00n AC and Pokemon I just stole from my sister linkusSmart
like i at least had a bit of fun with tennis aces
with golf i just had regret buying it
AC I at least got enjoyment out of due to its release time
He should be taking shots instead because drunk ideas would be more fun
AC I didn't even enjoy because of the time because I had rune factory
a friend was ranting to me about how much he disliked the recent sports games
is he the reason Daisy wasn't in the new Strikers
Doesn't seem he was involved with the Tennis/Golf games
i'd still play animal crossing to this day if i didn't burn out throughout spring and summer of 2020 lol
anytime they'd add new content i'd come back and then realize "yeah i've already put all the time i really wanted to into this already" and just do other shit
Just saw a picture of a group of people cosplaying as adobe programs
2 people dressed as photoshop
The bot met the mysterious loner at the smash local
They probably play young link and that's why they don't have friends
Fuck blocking that poison
I can't do it
Cake was in ch5 though right?
I can't block shit in this game
Cant you just rebuy it
I can only block in ttyd lol
yea i find the block pretty easy i just always anticipate the bite lol
so i never get it anyway
Hey phantom and chat HeyGuys
Coney got sent a lou bega horror game tonight for wheel champ
Lou bega horror game? yaliY
arie found the setup i was just the guinea pig that tested it lol
it's pretty easy once you get the idea
you can just do the jump instead
hey im back my friend is streaming so I left
hes still streaming Im just watching both streams now
you're close it's just precise
I forgot about Super Blooper
is this seed impossible or it's just whack?
Whack is an understated
When super blooper is practically required, its more than wack
Are you going to do Goomba King?
dont forget hammer bush
One chapter in 2 hours ouch
why is normal junior here
Thanks for the youtube content
Where was regular hammer?
streamer in pain sells tho
only if you make it clickbaity
"WORST SEED EVER NOT CLICKBAIT"
Nah content is content
use the Coney thumbnail w/ the text "HAMMERLESS ISN'T FUN????"
I mean I think people like watching these type of seeds because of how stupid it is
as a youtube watcher i would enjoy watching this tbh LUL
And also you have the hammerless clickbait
And it can just be called Im never do hammerless again
you can put something like "even dev says its the worst seed ever" in there, you got my blessing
i first starting watching with the "nightmare seed" video so i'd say this has similar "streamer pain" energy
it's really weird that tutankoopa's only even remote weakness is stomp and even then it's only 60 lol
only one way to find out Kappa
bruh i'm not about getting charged for inflicting psychological pain
You would have more checks and more likelihood to get them right?
tbf, pretty much anything would've made the seed better. early laki, more chances for important items early
I think hammerless is goind to work way better with full gear shuffle. big chests are too restrictive
that is my main issue with it, disregarding hammerless
warehouse key was in toybox?
i mean, the seed can still keep on giving
imagine going out of your way to give mario gifts and he just leaves then there
what's that meme again, with the guy with the crazy hair infront of that map
Goombario knocks this seed out of the park!!
His name is Charlie Day I think
"I committed a sin" *thumbnail of upgraded goombario,* there, planned your next vid
the race seed was a sin
100hrs of rando? dang, you're making strides towards my goal
200 hours? You've been counting?
I wonder how many hours I have?
my goal is to make people waste as much time with it, collectively, as ive spent making it
tbf, I look at your camera or gameplay. I don't pay much attention to the items or timer
@buff00n did you remember to say happy birthday to Mega Man X7 today?
but I talked about Mega Man X with some mates, if that's worth anything
for me it's always chapter 7 scaled 4s
i sure hope a gdq run doesnt look like this LUL
abandon the run if they try to surprise you with Hammerless
Should you do ch5?
im here full time now
blue bow looks awesome
ive never seen that skin
FEW is still installing I hate the switch's internet chip
when you have 500 down but the switch goes at 3mb
You got OG FEW?
I played the old one a year ago
Cause I got it for like 10 bucks at a local game store
shit was omega clearanced
who cares about go mode when you have goombario mode
why would they give you anything after the best partner
Was gonna say you should because it'd be funny but this is good youtube content so maybe don't do that
what do item pouches do
"This seed STOLE my hammer!?!?"
This seed TOOK my KIDS!?!?
Can't have shit in detroit
I found a melee set that I actually like
I thought so too
Its Chango vs Fuaxhebro at BoBC 3, its because Chango just only played for time
And I like that
tho I can't promise you'll be safe from TacoGuyy
but camping is LAME. Melee's supposed to be COOL.
Didnt melee players try to ban timeouts on more than 1 occasion?
@1STSTAR__ I can promise you'll be safe with other TacoGuy
Other tacoguy is best tacoguy
Puff was killing the game. Apparently.
Ledge is dumb af in Melee.
Why's ledge your advantage state
Are there any puff players besides hbox people get mad at?
Its funny, even with all of that shit puff wasnt even the best in the game
Hbox is the only Puff that won shit, so I want to say no
Its like ult steve to a lesser degree
Or a greater degree
Because melee puff is uhh
my melatonin is hitting me hard i think im gonna go to bed
In conclusion people dont like lame
or figuring out counterplay
You see fox is cool so armada did nothing bad
it's cool when Fox does it. it kills the game when Puff does it.
Counterplay discussion always gets drowned out by the "this character is lame" discussion
phanto274Jam just in time
I like that emote
I'm tempted to sub for that emote
phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam phanto274Jam
phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES phanto274BLANKIES
Is it possible for an item to unlock a chpater to be in that chapter?
What even are fuzzies?

SOMEBODY TOUCHED MAH SPAGETT
I HOPE SHE MADE LOTS OF SPAGHETTI
I told my community about how cool Paper rando is random239Comfy
What about dog island phanto274Thonk
Dog Island is how I found your channel HypeLUL
A proper send off
... didn't we already see the palace key
1 minute until new years
The most menacing castle
happy new year PogChamp
I accidentally killed petra woops
I wanted to play her but I don't want to do the map again so oh well
I got Hapi so it's fine
I feel like there's no point to playing on classic if you're not down to just say "woops"
Except if felix dies
He is staying on this playthrough
He's fast and he's my favorite
I need him to shittalk everyone for me
moles is gonna have it
Casual is good if getting into the FE series but you absolutely need to start accepting losses if you wanna dive deeper
Go check it first and if I'm wrong I'll gift a sub
No I mean if you don't have it after palace
when you go into fields
Is a giant nit
My fucking fingers LMAO
at least I dont have to gift
see, wasn't that a fun seed
I think this setting should stay in dev hell
just say "whoops it broke or something"
Look man Mario is tired
and people keep asking for jumpless seeds
people deserve to be locked away
who wants to not jump cancel a spin
@Icebound777 who are these masochists that want to see the world burn
Damn black crystal king
Thats so cool looking
you can traverse surprising amounts of the game on the lift parakarry gives ....
like i don't know either lol
hammerless, jumpless start, shuffle quizmo into the pool, make the toybox slot machine have progression ...
oh god the oinks
I say these would be ass but I've played fullsanity on windwaker with all the pain checks so....
treasure charts should never be turned on NOPERS
Having a nice frosted cookie and doritos at 9:14
and sploosh kaboom almost ALWAYS has something because it's sphere 0
Feeding fish has no progression or item
I dont care lol
Windwaker rando is fun with race settings on
Because that's just chests and dungeons
And glitches don't get banned for WW races
because SD is piss easy
I forgot what Tubba's actual color is
It also mods in the swift sail and with SD sail pumping it goes absurdly fast
So superswims are just not that much faster lol
I would say tomodachi life rando but that game is already incredibly ranndo
He doesn't play any games that'd be interesting
gacha and smash bros
I hate that you're right
I dont play gachas I play a gacha
that was the default
couldn't be arsed to change it
At least she got taken out by the goat
I was gonna say that I play the gacha because it has my favorite video game ost but thenI was timed lol
Def not love live
yea put hi back
he can serve the 10 minutes
How can you play that many kirby games and say a gacha is the best ost
yeah, he can stay there
I've played Heroes, but I never put money into it
Pallos prison will always be occupied
I've not played arknights much I usually opt for bloons when I play a mobile game so I've not put money into it
every free roll did nothing but depress me. Why would I pay money for that.
Dusk hasn't been on a banner so I haven't cared to even roll in arknights yet
My favorite Terraria mod for whatever reason is officially partnering with a Touhou gacha game
Oh yea I saw that
how the hell does a mod officially partner with a completely unrelated party
@TacoGuy74 we should play terraria again
It's the devs partnering not the mod directly
@buff00n Their reason was community overlap
@TacoGuyy Have you ever played calamity mod?
I've never played modded terraria
I think it'll be up your alley
wtf is that attack
I have never seen that
5+ 2 per ruffpuff
saw someone on twitter named mercedes is gay
One of the songs in that gacha is the reason why Im taking music production classes LMAI
But uhhh hows the weather
@TacoGuyy I mean. She is.
Is it time to beat bowsers ass
saw someone on twitter named wehave2bansteve
I've a friend who chastised me for making Mercedes a dancer. Said she was too pure hearted.
oh wait its onin
Mario, we present you, a crib
a stylish flying bathtub
there's a blanket and a pillow in the thing
its like the cars bed of bathtubs
How does she live after you know, exploding
*Meta knight victory theme plays
You mean to tell me this disastrous seed will have a disastrous ending
Can you power shock final bowser
Oooooo pink star dude
That is pretty funny
My wario amiibo gave me a steel tome
What does that imply
so i can come to you when i have those jumpless seeds yes?
The seed of all time
I forgot how good the tracks were here
MMBN just has jams
"Hey ice learn this game, there's a 30% chance the run lives"
SPEED STRATS OR BUST
Was 5 the only one that has the turn based thing?
I actually didn't like them lol
excuse me sir this is an E rated game
I love that sound bit LUL
Play what you wanna play tho
After rando assaulted me with last location every seed
I kinda don't wanna play it right now LUL
The first and only seed I got
The tutorial mobs were Yurts
And I was like
And lemme guess they didn't scale them to the area
that sounds like some nerd shit
I'm back with wendys
So Multiversus def got better but idk if it's enough for me to really consider it for a side game over strive
Also the netplay was a travesty with the server issues today
First rollback game I've played where if it rolls back your inputs also get fucked
Because it kept throwing me off stage
It was consistent for the last 2 hours every game rolled back at least a little bit
Where the first hour it was butter
I won't be touching 1v1
I think tilts on the ground would do wonders for gameplay
My 2 big gripes are how much the top tiers just swing and that's their neutral you can't contest and that the punish game isn't cool outside of the trap shit
Me and jesse did some bullshit with projectiles and rocket but most of the shit is just up air down air still
Even then Dan made a good system around his limitations and balanced around it
I have been saying this at people since the 1st beta but whiff lag should be different than on hit lag for a game without a shield
Rivals 2 looks so fucking good
I need a beta for that this instant
actually give me a beta when they make Sylvannos
Then give it to me that instant
I am waiting for them to show Kragg
I wanna see what bullshit dan gives kragg this time
Eli was very bad at first
She's been buffed a shitton and has some stuff now
Yea I could never get around handling her air shit
I just played Ori and Sylv and idk if they'll put Ori in 2 so I will just play Sylv
Genuinely a top 5 fighting game char for me
Sylv was there before they got nerfed and changed but they're still close
I'll mess with multi again in a day or 2 tho when the servers stop being how they are
I love that nintendo is specifically removing fates first from the 3ds
They know that shit was bad
You just need conquest for the gameplay and then skip every cs
But hey if you marry them THEN you get a letter that says you're not fucking a relative :)
Look corrins step sis just got stuck
What else would he do
I was gonna book one of the twins for metafy just to review some shit but their availability times are so ass and random
I still wish we got to stream anything while in vegas
Their internet just genuinely didn't function at ALL that week
Bear bought a new router while we were there lol
But yea a cox guy came in on the tuesday and plugged in a cable that just wasn't properly plugged in and the internet worked well
Oh it still ass for the twitch side but it actually functions in their house now
It genuinely just shut off for hours when I was there LOL
And the cell service is ass in their downstairs
So if I wasn't in my room I couldn't do anything LOL
I also have a high tempo shit when I see sonic 06
It goes faster than the game loads
Why did buff00n put fat mario dumpy on my timeline
I'm still pissed I had to pay 10 bucks to play reindog right away
I simply do not want to play any other character
Training mode does let you play any char regardless of owning
So they have half of that
Jesse got bugs in like 20-30 minutes
This doesn't look as bad as liberations
Yeah the sad part is, 5 turned me off cause of liberation, i never even bothered playing 6 :(
Also been considering my emotes
I like the RF ones but people don't use them, I think I may get them done as oshawotts to keep it consistent
People generally just recognize oshawott better and like it better so I think it'd just be better even if I like having raven emotes
But yea I'd just be getting tacogu1Ban and tacogu1Bless turned oshawott
maybe I'll re-commission the mash emote eventually too but I tip high for animated so I wanna be able to do that before I get it
That's one thing that I super loved about trusty's style
Currently tho the raven emotes are on bit slots anyway so I'll prolly just move tacogu1Eugh down to 1k so people actually have it and fill my animated slots first
Cause I fucking love tacogu1Eugh and I need people using that shit
my mom just texted me a gif of wario falling down a hole
it doesn't restart either he's just dead
why did she send me this
"why would you raid me"
to let the viewers watch someone better than me
uncle ben what happened
mostly just following route without live timer, before shadowman I died and never saved cause why the hell would I save? Then came back to cloudman. That was 4 and a half hours
was trying to hold out for jeny's stream , never raided her but it was getting late
and starting today Im trying an actual stream schedule
ill just copy my discord
First ever real attempt at a stream schedule. Gonna be trying Tue, Thu, Sat, and Sun. Tue and Thu will start around 4:30 or 5pm EST and need to put more thought into the weekends. Fridays will be more of a "If I Feel Like It". So gonna try this out for a few weeks and see how it goes.
bro if I could stream rn Id be streaming for like 10 hours a day rn. I miss it T_T
I, hopefully we, miss you too
sundays are a given 5pm est because... reasons OMEGALUL
Hopefully soon T_T I am ITCHING to be back at it
you what i hate. Time zones
i want universal time and i want it to be mine :)
I would work on sundays so the race was impossible
Mountain time for everyone
then one sunday im like "fuck it" I called in to race. Then next day at work I found out it was a holiday and didnt get paid for labor day
It was great the week I was in Colorado last year. Hated coming back to est
colorado is shit... but I have a legit reason
not many natural disasters to worry about, weed, its dry so not much humidity too
My last job was called Colorado Boxed Beef LMFAO
so yeah, THAT colorado was shit
Is that like Omaha steaks but worse?
if you grew up here it aint bad :)
I AM ALTITUDE TRAINING WHILE SPEEDRUNNING Kappa
altitude training while sleeping
oh phantom, do you wanna join anime watch party with Mitzi, Jeny, and me? We start Monday
Bakuman, they havent seen it
yeah that one ^
sit in on the first ep then decide
ok axl we watch bakuman then you have to rewatch onepiece with me Kappa
I can watch a few with you rn if you want
let me get my HHD then
so these runs are pretty dependent on encounter rng?
@PerMitzi mitzi, I have the first 950 eps archived from fansubs lol
yeah, I watched it weekly for like 12 yyears lol
oh phantom, with regards to bakuman. Its by the same creators that did deathnote. Its a different genre but still a wild ride
yo komari, phantom asked me to check in. What should I tell him?
let me trty that again
the category is called BeastSP so didnt what you to think he was done OMEGALUL
after Bass is it just run to gregar?
why would you need it anywhere else
Imagine dying to BassBX but still golding
oh, he is working on PA list
Felix is 10 levels above my other 3 units currently
he is simply the only unit I need
I may or may not have discovered you from looking at the Limit Break submissions and saw you submitted pape
and then realized you are the one that made the tracker
I'm submitting super pape myself to limit break and pace since it has yet to be in an in person marathon at least Any%
paper mario block at limit break would be cool
up to you in the end
I submitted a few things myself
FF1PR FF2PR and Z2
Gonna probably submit Jets of Time rando too
I can't justify another vacation lol
I'm going in person if I get in
and Utah is 2 states over
We can just make glenn pay for all our food at MWSF to save you money
I remember when P5 was 16 hours LUL
the accounting teacher LMAO
If you see a notification on discord, ignore it. I accidently tried to call you lol
but then you have twins for that hot Mari on Yuri action!! phanto274Thonk
Do you think Higsby ever had a chance with Mari?
what are you talking about
I didn't finish the run
vod dosent exist so its invalid Kappa
Should I keep playing FE or should I start a ww run
I must get good for the doggo charity
rather back to being good
Hello raiders. Welcome to phantom's stream. We play with megaman - I mean play games with - I mean we play megaman games. Also we live to play with your Forbidden Memories, we have a !slots that never gives us what we want, and we fondle our pads and press the right buttons. Welcome in.
i don't blame them
Honestly I just want to have a <2:25
I techincally have one if rng didn't exist
super swim is stupid
I played for a 2:22
I think like a 33 or something with 8th try pg skip
I think I have a 32 but that one didn't technically touch a portal for a frame so it's not valid
Skipping him saves fucking 3 minutes I can't avoid it >:(
If I was warm I could 22 without it
No if I get a pacer to that again I am deadass fighting that fucker
I just have to practice phase 1
For some reason tho I'm warm on literally every trick still except door clip
I hate door clip
i you want top 10 times jsut run BeastSP Kappa
why in the retro category rather then mbnn
Give me a manipless cat, and I'll run it for 2 or 3
But bubble man is a dick
legacy collection will probably help when it comes out if everyone just streams in the category
Just do the frame perfect aqua manip
Yeah, I sadly doubt there will be a legacy collection category
he tried so hard but he cant do that
I am sure if someone ask nicely we can get one
just tell terra we want it Kappa
you forgot NT too
Also learned streamlabs was what caused all my audio issues with WW so my choices rn are blue screens or bad audio LOL
I gotta choose blue screens tho because I need audio for this game lol
Yea but I'm lazy
So I just gamble it each time I close it
I didn't crash today
Shit I clicked homebrew and not haxchi
We have booted the wii u in pasta mode
We have achieved italian
I'm unhappy with living
Isn't there someone you forgot to ask
Ok I first tried the swims I failed and hit my roll clips I think I'm good
Time to miss pause storage on the PG cutscene
ok lurking no audio cause stream lol
DM'd something for you to laugh at later LUL
game boy is a tag!?
theres a guy streaming valorant under game boy... MUST BE ONE HELL OF A FUCKING PORT 4Head
then dont lose gavel skip next time
