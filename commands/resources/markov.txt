good luck
I'm excited to try this
yoo glgl
nice peril manip
restart computer!
i now have the english MM practice rom on my wii
english is faster for any% nmg/unrestricted for various reasons lmao
I felt that
yeah iirc english is faster for srm categories but the only one i'd run is any% unrestricted cuz it's 20 minutes long lol
definitely more interesting in nmg tho
WHOS THIS SEWER FREAK
that was the best thing i've ever fucking seen
what was that sewer man what was that
yo phantom GL HF
also thanks again for inviting me to do commentary, I had a blast
I was glad to have risch there, I couldn't have explained many things in that much detail LUL
hmm i will consider clicking the follow button
wouldn't it be funny if you got struck by lightning a third time
its comedy rules of threes, itll happen
Hai hai, you wonderful person, you. : D
I'm alright. Did I come in at a weird time? LuL
Not.. AT ALL? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Side note: I made tacos. :D
Naturally, I made enough for everyone.
Go pick that badge up, mister. >:I
Badges have feelings too.
That badge is going to be dwelling on that all day long ... like ... Damn ... I can't believe that Luigi(?) didn't want me ... That's harsh ...
oh no ... gosts
guess who got a raphnet today?!
and they work together!
setup was a pain
kept mapping start to hammer
don't laugh!
That flower just destroyed you, and then gave you pity money that it stole from your pocket while you were distracted.
I just woke up tho and have to get ready for work. I'll explain more stuff later over discord
have fun gamer
Ah yes. The shyghosts.
I like that you had to go the mansion to get that.
When the game is kind-of? vanilla.
Nice Sushi colors.
Haven't seen that one before.
why do you look flat
pokeball sushie
I'm kidding. Don't hate me. ;-;
In before they're all chilling in a single corner of the flower field?
Did you already hug Act 1?
Right. Forgot if you can set the bridge to be down by default or not.
This is a pretty rude chapter six placement.
she water on my block til i squirt
What the **** did I just read?
The game is making you do some things that you don't want to do. LuL
Have you fought the early dojo fights?
Oh. Got'cha.
You can do it!
The real question is if you should do it.
Nice refund.
Such a weirdly strong badge.
I had no idea how good Refund was, when I was young.
Well done!
The things we do when the seed is being rude.
If you have a quote bot, I'd like to petition for adding "You better have a mailman in your pocket."
Also, that penguin had a cloud in his cupboard.
I mean, where else do you keep your cloud turtle things?
Certainly not in the sky like a savage.
It really, really wants you to go to Bowser's Castle. KEKwait
Depends on the chapter attached, I guess?
Did we thought? Did we really?
That's rough, buddy.
Thanks, windows.
Windows: Notice me, senpai. *Hides knife behind back*
My audio drivers do the big dumb every time my windows updates.
don't tell my sister
Clearly, you need star pieces.
He was thinking about it. I mean, everyone in this seed is, from what we've seen.
Luigi(?) has just pissed a lot of people off.
That's all.
you know what would make traps better
You ever just find a calculator out in the desert?
if it showed the same pickup animation for the item
annd then exploded
mario holds it above his head and gets struck by lightning
run ded
I went to get a drink of water, and I missed what?
Strugglebus, here we come!
As much as I love hanging out here, I might go play some DBD soon.
I'm ... assuming? that you don't play DBD?
I have severe anxiety to the point of having a heart that tries to physically end me. I don't bleeping know why I play DBD.
I wonder how many items you use on average in all of your Paper Mario seeds.
It really varies, though. 'Cause like ... sometimes it's a couple items due to good luck, and, sometimes it's ... a LOT of items.
how much is power bounce?
Attack FX Attic
I'd like to request turning on Attack FX A, in honor of this being quite A seed.
Oh neat.
The shyguys are on something today.
He was too powerful. They had to keep Kooper and his shell separate.
We can do chapter 1 now, right?
Oh gods. Imagine if the slot machine was in the pool.
I really want the piggos to be in the pool. >:I
Always Bow.
But, slapping the **** out of stuff.
lurking while driving
dont watch stream and drive
Why did Kooper have that?
Kooper is just an all or nothing kinda guy, you know?
He's dead, Jim.
How much is the hp plus? LuL
fire flower must pay for what it did
Hello my darling
Hello my ragtime gal
runs into the bomb jail break out expecting to come out of it alive
so ... what did all of these traps replace in the item pool?
Such as?
random lightning strikes
These Koopa bros colors. LuL
They're like an even more scuffed version of themselves.
And that's saying something.
Time for a gamba? LuL
That's a welcome party.
Are you slowly or rapidly losing your sanity? Since it's not a question of if.
For sure. Instead of just ... "We know that we have to full clear. Let's go, auto pilot!"
Bowser's elite patrol right there.
good ol' Windows bullying
was good! Finished Coromon and jumped into Boyfriend Dungeon unironically Kappa
how's the rando?
What's Assumed Fill? :o
so a more diverse logic to items?
sweet. Love me some extra rando BloodTrail
ez game Kappa
Five and a half hour seed?
that just means fun then :)
what's Assumed Fill?
I watch PM Rando, I don't keep up with the development
What is assumed fill? Well ... when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much..
The easy answer for all Rando ... ... Just Hundo the Seed 4Head Kappa
I'd like the randomizer to be able to randomize the desert "area" tiles.
I've played enough other Randos where it's happened LUL
Chomp. :O
Oh neat.
The logic for this seed has been all over the place.
This is gonna be a long one. LuL
She's just exploding with love.
f I'm late, gl hf!
assumed already giving you a wild goose chase i see
oh god is that a 'total time playing rando' timer?
im so sorry lmao
what a bro
what trap setting are you rocking
i think it's 25% of consumables then? ... something like that
booming voice there chanterelle
duude what a chain
yea okay pape, lol
was that in the cloud a maple?
dude the god combo of jump badges, what
lol, welp
you know, that tracker has a great notepad function i heard
tbf im also really bad at taking notes
Oh I'll probably remember that, how could I not? ... 10 minutes later ...
Ah. I succumbed to my taco food coma. How goes the seed?
Still no birb.
did AntiGuy ever have something for you?
aight gotta bounce, wish you that portrait soon lol
Give water stone to Lily in chapter 6?
Did you buy from Rip Cheeto?
Is it one of the vines?
Didn't they just add that you can give the artifact to Kolorado without finishing Ch2?
Assumed fill too hard so you had to cheat with glitches Kappa
Yep, that's what happens when things are actually random
no more easy runs
well, maybe some, but not most
ooh, that's a sick color for Peach
lurking cuz driving
nice gold Kappa
is this WABITR?
you love to see it
good luck with your first run that totally won't be able to watch
brace yourself, I've acquired Malort's
gl gamer
ngl I was surprised to find out that there are 10 falzar runs
"I don't know what Malort's is" you will come CB
you WILL
bop the boss Pog
not yet
you can put it in if you want
it's good vs diveman and aquaman
yeah it's better if it's A code
yeah trnarrw code doesn't matter in gregar
Wait, you're playing Falzar?
you can use it on elementman
in pav3
Welp time to wait for yet another cable
There's no display port so time to spend 50 bucks on a usb converter
I just want my fucking monitor so I can do anything I want to
what do you mean there is no display port and no functional hdmi
That literally wont work
the pc doesn't have it
there is 2 hdmi and a dvi
God I'm dumb they were fuckin plugged
Thank you for curing stupidity for me
yoo good luck my dude!
I believe in you
most importantly
weed mario believes in u
just imagine him with a thumbs up instead of a hand on his hip
my clip finger was ready
I love falzar for that reason. can't brute force it
thus far, Falzar seems like pain
I love it
spoutman is amazing. drip drip
do you have splits inside your splits?? sick
Why would you want it earlier when you could have it now
wait what the fuck are you
olimar lookin ass
Lance pog
it's Aquaman, or SpoutMan, cuz Capcom USA didn't want to get sued
good call
man, I love watching MegaMan just SWOOCE all over the place
you got robbed with that ElementTrap
GG yess. good job
yaa it is hard to tell at first
on a phone call, lurking
PBs were built on hope
or whatever the saying is. glgl
good evening phantom, GL HF
huh ... on my screen your name is exacltly 0.5 pixels wider than mine.
never noticed it was that close
I tried to click on you and twitch took me to the browse category list
Twitch dont want me here
ok so the one use of this tech for wario so far
huh ... now that you mention it ... yeah it is
Is nair combos like 5% longer
But we could already do that lol
Back in my day, we had to click on streams uphill both ways
The input is free at least
It's just fuck up a halfcircle by one number lol
I randomly woke up at 3am, so here I am LUL
I went to bed at 22:30 like a responsible adult *shudder*
did you find out the milk was bad before you had some?
late night gang
oh good
I've found out the milk went bad the wrong way before
would not recommend
I think I could use this for zard but that's like it lol
cause the full momentum nair input only works on nair so I could use this for back air or something
reset then
I missed half of it
wait you can just gold the button for text boxes? Must be nice Kappa
as it should be, really
Rune factory does that :)
although the way BN does it also makes a lot of sense
5 I might actually figure out a route for, the storyline seems MUCH better to run and I actually have movement tech to work with from shortswords
Shortsword charge attacks break movement it's so fun
If you do it off a hill you keep full momentum of your dash and the gravity is so low that you just go so fucking far
Hai hai.
Hai grumpypants?
You seem like you're having a time.
Oh okay. Haha.
gold though
Pape 64 (REAL)
All around me are familiar faaaces, worn out plaaaceeessss
pay the penalty
oh were we predicting? LUL
uh, sorry my phone bugged out I definitely meant 3,3,3
blame it on autocorrect
Tell us of this plan of yours.
Oh good.
What could possibly go wrong? Four hours of work, all with the possibility of catastrophic failure that could have been avoided?
that sounds horrible
speedrunners man
built differently
The self abuse.
It's fine. You've got this. First try, new PB.
I don't know if I'd still run BN if Gregar was a 50-50 LUL
But it feels longer. LuL
hmm yeah, that's a big difference
it's okay, there's plenty of time to bounce back
so at worst it's a coin flip for a PB
Congrats on the WR.
wait what
Do you think that a skip directly into the final chapter is theoretically possible? Via, I dunno, glitching into loads zones and such?
damn, that coin flip saves a lot of time Kappa
Like ... hidden under levels and such.
'Cause they need to be stored in the memory somewhere.
Just some void?
It has to be somewhere.
I love speedy spin
rip run Sadge
Ok after fiddling with the "tech" for a bit I never drop it because it's just a timed half circle and I'm only gonna use it on zard lol
Puts his tail behind him in like 2 frames so kinda want that
So, if chapter five has said trigger glitch, then ... surely the other chapters have un-discovered loadzones too?
I get that, but like, even the card has to be stored somewhere. The loadzone attached to the card is stored somewhere.
Sorry if I'm being annoying about it, but, I refuse to believe that it's impossible.
Not with that attitude.
I can now down throw up smash with zard but like
why the fuck would I ever do that
bthrow bair is same damage better position and bthrow nair sets up for 0 to death lol
I dunno. It took them like ... 20 years to skip the WW barrier.
ACE is busted
That's pretty fun.
Is there any tech in this game that is similar to a lot of the Zelda game's extended bomb boost jumps?
Also hate gimrs video because he puts a part that says "Shotos can do this" and you know what char type he doesnt show
Terry has no shoryu fireball or tatsu
Well I guess rising tackle is kind of a shoryu now in 15 but not in smash
I drank all of my orange juice, and now I'm sad. ;-; It's all gone.
Correction: I chugged all of my orange juice because it was too tasty, and I couldn't help myself.
What did Chomp ever do to you? D:
You monster.
One time is one too many. >.>
Nicely done!
Hey gl on the runs!
such a long category props to you
OH SWEET! that means alot :)
definitely LUL People usually run the pc or N64 emu version
Maybe this could help with THIS waft confirm
Thought to myself then I do it and it works if I do it perfect
But then I did it just with a dash and it worked better LOL
ok the one thing it would do is make jablock waft easier
because I dont have to do my jump input frame perfect
Void is tweeting clips of it and it's just him shitting on people who aren't anti-airing him and doing a b reverse
If I do this jaemi is going to dragdown forward air me and I am dead
fuck falco
The only useful things I've seen so far are helping bad turnaround animations and diddy kong can dtilt z drop banana if he picks it up with dtilt
But like any safe air you'd hit a shield with point blank you have a positive on the rps anyway so unless your dashback NEEDS it then why do it lol
warios dashback for example is mad fucking good because he lifts his ass up and leans immediately and his feet dont exist lol
GOLD gold
ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOUR SOUL
I'd love if you had this one Peach section in rando
cuz if you could select from 3 random items, I think that'd be hilarious
which of these items does Mario hate, Princess?:
true, that in itself is fun
Kammy places Goombario in front of chest
gl gl phanto274Bless
It's summer heat already where I live
Nicely done.
Did you draw your splits background?
Oh I see it nice
They're adding what for artists?
Oh that's pretty cool
I was born in 95 monkaS
yooo phantom gl on the run!! phanto274Bless
did you end up getting milk??
Also i hate chapter 5 Madge
not that guy. he killed my run earlier
I need to work on this chapters movement specifically.
All aboard the strugglebus!
ty for stream phantom!! Hope to catch the next one soon! peepoWave
I had a fright jar fail, jumped on fire bar, got speedied and a pokey encountered me when I was trying to bombette first strike :)
Ah. I live
I'm ... on hope
Right. Forgot if you were fuckin plugged
As much is amazing. drip
huh ... on my darling
dont want the follow button
I went to click on a drink of yours.
She's just imagine him with that
This is amazing. drip drip drip drip
One time my wii
Hey propokH / I'm driving home, so can't talk. good luck BloodTrail
Hopped on quickplay cause I just wanted to play and this mario was just mashing the rar shit so I went zard
He didn't live very long
he put himself at backair tipper range every time LOL
I also refuse to call this the gimr or any of the names he gave it because it's just a control stick angle lol
Yea you just corner notch after an initial dash
If you flick it you go back and if you dont you just drift in it's not really anything new lolll
Anything I've tested with this I do with just an attack cancel or full momentum nair or even just a dash and it's the same thing LOL
The only thing I'd use this for is for like fullhop back airs because you can't attack cancel that
Yea that's what I do for my bike look wavebounces
I went to the alt account to check follow requests and an anime tab pops up and it's just some cosplay girls ass
This is why I never have home page on
I literally only follow RF artists on that account and it's like 10 of them lol
I just followed like 10 artists I like most on that account so my timeline is only that and nothing else
Since that account is just for annoyed rambling I may as well have something I want to see while I'm there lol
doing a normal run i see
We should rando race sometime now that my pc wouldn't explode for it
yeah gl
what is top 15 rn?
really? damn. slopdop was top 10 when I started my grind
thank you for harnessing bad rng, it may help with the decision to run tonight
I have never recovered from absorbing morphs rng to get any% record
yeah, I would've gotten 3:46 probably
my rng is still godawful after that
i bought so much shit today!!!
mini min amiibo
monkey ball banana mania
network transmission
and a logitech litra
most recent, i got it on PS5 for 20 bucks
you will one day KEKW
I can join the next NT race LUL
EzekielSD : Alright so ... arbitrary code execution, you can jump into the blue house? And y'all got Clippy? EzekielHD : Yeah. EzekielSD : The future is crunk! EzekielHD : Anything else you wanna know? EzekielSD : Is Final Bowser too much? Am I ready? EzekielHD : I can't tell you everything. But if you want to make history, you got to charge your own jumps. EzekielSD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD + EzekielHD : We going to the volcano! EzekielSD : We going to the volcano!
yeah, last one had a turn out for 7 runners
its only hard in the beginning
Ah Phantom5800, I see that you've included the partner Goombario in your party. However, I see that he's also surrounded by other trash partners. Instead why not use Goombario, the best partner in Paper Mario? It opens you up to some real all-star attacks, like Tattle and Multibonk.
Dear Twitch User Phantom5800: I noticed your chat does not contain the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. I have decided it is best to add this pasta to your chat forthwith rather than unfollow. Again, the pasta I am adding to your chat is the "Dear Twitch User" pasta. Thank You.
phantom, its happening phanto274Hype
Bored Ape #1398 Owner says buying NTFs was Biggest Regret of his life. He is unable to sell it for even a fraction of what he spent, it financially ruined him.
The collapse begins guys ...

also gl, sorry i had to get some pastas out
you gonna continue bird up or just a one and done?
thought about doing an unboxing for the litra
imagine doing unboxing for lighting without any lighting KEKW

the packaging in here is nice
I can take this light off the monitor stand and mount it to to a tripod/boom arm!!!

Grumpy bad, though.
So, it's manageable.
I see that you are pulling out all of the tricks for this.
20 bp

i was ready for the big dumb attack but forgot the little clouds take his turn if you die
did u save yoshi's?
but what if the yoshis have weed for mario
buy goombario
mario needs that
what if partner attacks are randomized? like bomb is headbonk and headbonk is waterblock and waterblock is bom
komari is disappointed in you
"I dont really care about bird" KEKW

on phantom for killing children
you threw it at jr
it's not about using it
that's funny af
it was on jr that is the problem
just time out
up and away him
just fright jar him
probably dink anyways
there should be a setting that puts good badges in out of the way places
mod bp plus so it can randomly take more than it gives
The Skollar Smooch is Hilarious
I think a nut animation specifically on bowser would be better
bowser can u not
4/20 lmao
wait sorry this is serious
shield 4 turns in a row bowser
